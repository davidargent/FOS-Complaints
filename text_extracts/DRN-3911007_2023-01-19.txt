DRN-3911007
The complaint
Mr T complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Amazon Platinum MasterCard unfairly declined 
a payment he tried to make.
What happened
Mr T opened an Amazon branded credit card with NewDay in December 2021. NewDay sent 
Mr T a credit card that required activation before being used. In addition, the credit card also 
came with an instant spend facility that allowed Mr T to spend up to £500 via his Amazon 
account before the physical card was received and activated. 
Up to April 2022, Mr T spent a total of £491.09. In May 2022 Mr T attempted to purchase 
something for £35 but the payment was declined. 
Mr T contacted NewDay and complained. Mr T said he hadnt received the credit card 
NewDay sent him when he opened his account. A new card was ordered. Mr T also said 
NewDay had failed to explain the instant spend facility when he opened his credit card.
NewDay sent Mr T a final response and said his payment had been declined as his credit 
card hadnt been activated. NewDay also said Mr Ts account included the instant spend 
facility which had been used to make previous payments but that the limit had been reached. 
However, NewDay paid Mr T £40 to apologise for the inconvenience caused. 
An investigator at this service looked at Mr Ts complaint. They thought NewDay had dealt 
with Mr Ts case fairly and didnt ask it to take further action. The investigator also said we 
couldnt consider Mr Ts concerns regarding how NewDay had dealt with his complaint. Mr T 
asked to appeal and said he was unhappy were unable to look into how a business handles 
a complaint. Mr T also said he was unhappy hed been able to use his account until the 
payment in May 2022 was unexpectedly declined. As Mr T asked to appeal, his complaint 
has been passed to me to make a decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When Mr T opened the credit card it came with an instant spend facility with Amazon. The 
facility meant Mr Ts credit card details were added to his Amazon account with the ability to 
spend up to £500 before the physical card was required to further payments. Mr Ts told us 
NewDay failed to make the instant spend facility clear when he opened the account. 
NewDays provided a copy of its account terms and Mr Ts credit agreement. They say Mr T 
may be offered the instant spend facility to allow payments to be made as soon as the 
account was opened. Amazons website was linked and included details of the instant spend 
facility which allowed Mr T to spend up to £500 without before being required to use the card 
NewDay provided. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mr T, but Im satisfied the details of the instant spend facility were set 
out at the point his credit card was approved. 
NewDays provided evidence of the payments Mr T made using his account. They totalled 
£491.09 with the last payment being made April 2022. So when Mr T tried to make the 
payment of £35 in May 2022 it took him over the instant spend limit of £500. That meant 
further payments needed to be made and authorised using the physical card. Im unable to 
agree that NewDay made a mistake when it declined Mr Ts payment. 
NewDays provided evidence that shows Mr Ts original card wasnt activated. And when 
NewDay responded to Mr Ts complaint it confirmed a new card had been issued and would 
need to be activated before he used the account to make payments. I understand Mr T 
doesnt recall receiving the original card, so Im pleased NewDay took steps to issue a 
replacement. Im satisfied that was a fair response to the issues Mr T raised after his 
payment was declined. 
In my view, NewDay provided information how his credit card operates when it was opened. 
And NewDays approved payments up to the £500 instant spending limit. The information 
available shows NewDay correctly declined Mr Ts payment in May 2022 and issued a 
replacement credit card. Im very sorry to disappoint Mr T but I havent been persuaded 
NewDay acted unfairly.
When Mr T called NewDay to query the declined payment it wasnt initially explained that 
hed gone over the instant spend limit. NewDay paid Mr T £40 to apologise for the service 
provided. Im satisfied thats a fair way to resolve Mr Ts complaint and recognises the 
impact of how his queries were handled. 
Mr Ts raised concerns about how NewDay handled his complaint. But, as our investigator 
has said, we can only look into complaints that are covered by the rules we operate under. 
The full details can be found in the Dispute Resolution Rules as set out by the Financial 
Conduct Authority. In short, they say we can consider complaints about various issues, 
including regulated activities. But complaint handling isnt a regulated activity or an issue that 
our rules allow us to consider in its own right. So Im unable to consider how NewDay 
handled Mr Ts complaint as part of this case.
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr T as I can see how strongly he feels in this matter. But as Im 
satisfied NewDay has already paid a settlement that is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances, Im not telling it to increase the award of do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that NewDay Ltd trading as Amazon Platinum MasterCard has already paid a 
settlement that is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2023.
