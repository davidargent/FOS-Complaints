DRN-3150739
The rules about complaining to the ombudsman set out when we can  and cant  look into 
complaints. In my decision, Ive explained what this means for Miss Ws complaint.
summary and background to complaint
Miss W said Capital One (Europe) plc mis-sold her payment protection insurance (PPI) 
with a credit card in 2005.
Capital One didnt agree we could look at a complaint about how the PPI was sold - because 
it said Miss W had referred the complaint to us too late.
But Capital One did pay back the amount of commission and profit share that was above 
50% of Miss Ws PPI premium. It did this because it didnt tell Miss W about the high level of 
commission and profit share shed pay  which was unfair.
Our adjudicator looked at all of this  but didnt think we could help with Miss Ws complaint 
about how this policy was sold. And they thought Capital Ones payment was a fair way to 
resolve the complaint.
Miss Ws representative disagreed with the adjudicators opinion  they didnt raise any new 
or additional points but repeated the same complaint points and arguments theyd previously 
made. 
The complaint has been passed to me for a decision. 
my findings
I cant look at all the complaints referred to me. The rules applying to this service say that  
where a business doesnt agree  I cant look into a complaint if its been referred to us more 
than six months after the business sends the consumer its final response letter, telling them 
they can refer their complaint to us. This is Dispute Resolution rule 2.8.2R(1)  and it can be 
found online in the Financial Conduct Authoritys handbook.
Capital One sent its final response on 8 September 2010 to Miss Ws previous 
representative. So Miss W had until 8 March 2011 to refer her complaint to us. But she didnt 
do this until June 2018. So the complaint was referred out of time under the rules I have to 
apply.
I can look into complaints referred outside the usual time limits where Im satisfied the failure 
to comply with the time limits was because of exceptional circumstances.
But Miss W hasnt mentioned any exceptional circumstances that could have affected her 
ability to refer the complaint by 8 March 2011. So, while I know this will be disappointing for 
her, I dont think that exceptional circumstances apply here.
So Im sorry that were unable to help Miss W with her complaint about how this policy was 
sold.
non-disclosure of commission
But I have considered the issue of non-disclosure of commission, including whether the non-
disclosure resulted in an unfair relationship under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  
and if so, what fair compensation would be to remedy that unfairness.
Having done so Ive decided Capital One should have disclosed the commission it received 
and that Capital Ones offer to refund some of the cost of PPI to compensate for the 
unfairness caused is fair. My reasons are set out below.
was there an unfair relationship?
Capital One didnt tell Miss W about the high levels of commission and profit share paid in 
this case. So taking into account: 
- The Supreme Court judgment in Plevin1 and the conclusion in that case that the non-
disclosure of commission could lead to an unfair relationship;
- The FCAs rules and guidance for handling complaints about the non-disclosure of 
commission and profit share - introduced in light of the Supreme Court judgment in 
Plevin - which requires a business to presume that the failure to disclose commission 
gave rise to an unfair relationship where the business expected commission and profit 
share to be more than 50% of the cost of the policy; and 
- the likelihood, in my view, that a court would determine that the relationship between 
Capital One and Miss W was unfair under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 
because Capital One didnt tell her about the high levels of commission and profit share 
in this case. 
I dont think Capital One acted fairly and reasonably in its dealings with Miss W because it 
failed to disclose the high commission and profit share.
redress to remedy that unfair relationship
Im now required to consider what is fair compensation in all the circumstances to remedy 
the unfairness I have identified.
Miss Ws representative has made a number of representations about this part of the 
complaint including the impact of the Plevin judgment and sections 140A and 140B of the 
Consumer Credit Act on her complaint.
In summary they have said Miss W should get back all the money she paid for the policy 
because: Capital One failed to tell Miss W about the high commission and profit-share rates 
paid, the low claims ratio and the restrictions and exclusions on cover. 
Because they say that meant the policy was poor value, I should find that Miss W wouldnt 
have taken out the policy had she known about the level of commission and she should 
receive a refund of all the premiums she paid.
But I dont agree. Im mindful of the following:
- The Supreme Court judgment in Plevin made no specific finding about whether the 
1 Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance Limited [2014] UKSC 61 in which the Supreme Court concluded 
that the non-disclosure of commission could lead to an unfair relationshipconsumer in that case would or would not have bought the PPI policy had the 
commission been disclosed; 
- A court would have a range of powers available under section 140 B to remedy the 
unfairness caused by the non-disclosure of commission  it does not follow that a 
court would automatically order a return of all the premiums paid or conclude that a 
consumer would not have purchased the policy had the commission been disclosed; 
and
- The FCA considered the matter and decided that it wouldnt be appropriate to merge 
the considerations about undisclosed commission in the existing rules and guidance 
about mis-selling (hence the two-step approach for firms handling PPI complaints) 
and that the impact of any undisclosed commission and any remedy caused by it 
should be considered at step 2.
Taking into account relevant law and the FCAs rules and guidance, my role as an 
ombudsman in this case is to determine what redress, if any, would represent fair 
compensation for Miss W in order to remedy the unfairness caused by Capital One not 
disclosing the high level of commission to her before she purchased the policy.
So, taking into account: 
- The FCAs guidance usually requires a business to refund the amounts paid by the 
consumer in commission and profit share above 50% of the policys cost, plus interest in 
order to remedy the unfairness caused by the failure to disclose the level of commission;
- refunding some of the money paid for the PPI policy in this way is an order which, in my 
view a court could, in the exercise of its discretion, make under section 140B of the 
Consumer Credit Act in order to remedy any unfairness; and
- I am not, as Miss Ws representative suggests, driven to conclude that she wouldnt 
have purchased the policy but for Capital Ones failure to disclose the level of 
commission for the reasons Ive given above.
I think it was fair for Capital One to calculate compensation in line with the FCAs guidance 
and return some of the money Miss W paid for her PPI policy - I consider this fairly removes 
the source of the unfairness. 
So I consider that Capital Ones payment of an amount equivalent to the commission and 
profit share paid in excess of 50% of the policy costs (plus associated interest where 
applicable) in line with the FCAs guidance to firms is fair in all the circumstances.
As Capital One has already paid Miss W compensation on this basis, I dont consider it 
should do anything further. 
my decision
Im unable to consider Miss Ws complaint about how her policy was sold, because it was 
referred to us too late  and Im not persuaded the failure to comply with the time limits was 
because of exceptional circumstances.
But because of the non-disclosure of commission and profit share, Ive decided that Capital 
One (Europe) plc should pay Miss W an amount equivalent to the commission and profit 
share paid in excess of 50% of the policy cost (plus associated interest where applicable). As Capital One (Europe) plc has already paid compensation on this basis, I do not consider 
that it should do anything more.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision about the commission aspect of the complaint before 11 January 2022.
