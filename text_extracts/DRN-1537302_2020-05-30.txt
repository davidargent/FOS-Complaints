The complaint
Mr P complains about charges on his NewDay Ltd credit card and how it dealt with his 
complaint.
What happened
Mr P says he is unhappy with the level of charges and interest applied to his NewDay credit 
card account. He says they are unfair and illegal and questions the fairness of cash 
transaction fees. Mr P says NewDay took too long to respond to his complaint and has been 
unfairly contacting him. He says NewDay increased the interest amount without telling him.
NewDay says it sent Mr P its final response letter on 10 April 2019. It says it refunded three 
late payment fees as a gesture of goodwill but the charges were correctly applied in line with 
agreed terms and conditions. NewDay says it's obliged to tell Mr P if he missed a payment 
and doesn't accept its contact was inappropriate. Its offered to speak to Mr P if he is in 
financial difficulties.
Mr P brought his complaint to us and our investigator didn't uphold it. The investigator 
thought the charges were correctly applied, when for example Mr P missed a payment or 
exceeded his credit limit. The investigator thought NewDay had written to Mr P about the 
interest rate increase and that he could have rejected it. He also thought 
NewDay's complaint response was about one week outside the time limit but didn't think Mr 
P brought his complaint to us for some two months and so didn't think that delay significant.
Mr P doesn't accept that view and in summary says NewDay has ignored the rules and 
regulations, and he has not received answers to his questions. He doesn't accept 
NewDay wrote to him and says its illegal to make charges on charges. Mr P says the 
contract terms are unfair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I have come to the same 
overall view as the investigator. I realise Mr P will be disappointed with my decision and I 
make clear to him that it would be for court, and not me to decide if an act was illegal.
I have looked at the account terms and conditions which I can see that Mr P agreed to when 
the account was opened. And I'm satisfied those terms and conditions make clear that a Â£12 
charge will be made for a late payment and where an account is over its credit limit. So I 
don't think NewDay has made a mistake by charging those fees where Mr P has either been 
late making a monthly payment or when his spending has taken him over his credit limit. I 
am also satisfied that details of those charges are on Mr P's account statements and I think 
NewDay has explained on a number of occasions when such charges would be made. 
I'm satisfied that the account terms and conditions also make clear that a cash transaction fee will be charged for certain transactions. I appreciate Mr P questions why such a fee is 
charged and or appropriate. But for the reasons I have explained I'm satisfied Mr P agreed 
to that term and condition and I have not seen any evidence that NewDay made a mistake 
by applying it.
I have looked at NewDay's records and can see that it sent Mr P a letter on 18 August 
2017 about an increase to the interest rates. I appreciate Mr P says he didn't receive it and 
questions if it was sent. But I think on balance it was sent and NewDay told Mr P that he 
could reject the increase if he wished. I don't think Mr P did reject the increase, and so I don't 
think NewDay made a mistake or acted unfairly by increasing the interest rates. I also think 
details of the increase were recorded on Mr P's account statements.
I accept NewDay took about a week longer than it should have to send Mr P its final 
response letter to his complaint. I have no doubt Mr P was concerned about the delay but I 
don't think it had a significant effect Mr P or on this complaint, as it was another two months 
before the complaint was brought to us.
I don't think NewDay made a mistake by trying to make contact with Mr P in these 
circumstances where for example there was  a late or missed payment. I also think 
NewDay is obliged to send certain regulatory letters to Mr P. I appreciate Mr P's concerns 
about such contact but I don't think it was unfair. 
Overall I'm satisfied NewDay has acted in line with agreed account terms and conditions 
which I think it made clear in the original agreement and in subsequent account statements. I 
don't think NewDay has made a mistake in applying charges and fees and have not seen 
evidence as Mr P says of it ignoring rules and regulations or by making mistakes by applying 
charges on charges as he suggests. I can see that Mr P says he is considering court action, 
and so I think this brings an end to what we in trying to sort out this complaint informally can 
do to resolve it.
My final decision
My final decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 June 2020.
