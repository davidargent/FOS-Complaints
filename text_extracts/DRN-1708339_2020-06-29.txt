The complaint
Mr M makes a number of complaints about National Westminster Bank Plc(NatWest) 
following a telephone call he made to it about access problems.
What happened
Mr M says he had problems accessing NatWest's online system. He says he spoke to 
NatWest about this but it didn't help him or allow him to speak to a supervisor. He also says 
it gave him incorrect information about the One Time Passcode (OTP). Mr M says 
NatWest has systematic online access and IT  problems. He says NatWest refused to allow 
him to make a complaint and refused to provide his sort code details so he could pass 
security or ask him an alternative security question. Mr M says he has been caused 
prejudice and would like compensation and for NatWest to fix its issues.
NatWest accepts when Mr M called it he was given incorrect information about the OTP. It's 
apologised for that mistake and for how it handled the call between it and Mr M. It says it did 
provide the correct information during the call but accepts that call took about one hour and 
has paid £150 compensation. It also says it will monitor the access and IT problems and 
update Mr M.
Mr M brought his complaint to us and our investigator thought NatWest dealt fairly with it. 
The investigator accepted NatWest had given Mr M incorrect information about the OTP and 
that he spent some time speaking to it. But thought the compensation paid was fair and 
reasonable. The investigator explained we couldn't tell NatWest to change its systems or 
processes and thought it dealt appropriately with Mr M when he called NatWest again.
Mr M doesn't accept that view and says the investigator's views are bias and incorrect.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I have come to the same 
overall view as the investigator and for similar reasons.
I have listened to the telephone calls between the parties when Mr M first contacted 
NatWest. There is no dispute here that Mr M was given incorrect information about the OTP. 
And I am sure he was caused frustration by that incorrect information as I accept Mr M knew 
that information was incorrect. I also accept that Mr M spent about an hour of his time 
speaking to NatWest about this, and so I also accept he was caused inconvenience and that 
not all the matters he called about could be resolved. But I'm satisfied NatWest has fairly 
apologised for the incorrect information, and for how it dealt with that call. I'm also satisfied it 
has paid what I think is a fair and reasonable amount of compensation of £150. And think 
DRN-1708339that fairly reflects the level of NatWest's mistake, and that Mr M didn't suffer any financial 
loss. I think Mr M was given the correct information during the call.
I'm also satisfied that NatWest has fairly agreed to monitor any further IT or access problems 
Mr M may have. The investigator has explained that we are not NatWest's regulator. And so 
it's not our role to tell it what its IT processes should be or that we can fairly comment on 
issues that Mr M says are systematic.
I have listened to the further call Mr M made to NatWest in which he says he was refused 
the opportunity of speaking to a manager, and during which NatWest refused to provide him 
with the sort code information. Having done so, I'm satisfied NatWest dealt fairly with Mr M 
during that call. I think it's up to NatWest to decide what its security questions are and I don't 
think it acted unreasonably by refusing to  give Mr M the sort code details when that was its 
security question. I also think NatWest's advisor did offer to ask a different security question 
and I don't think the advisor acted unreasonably by not transferring the call to a 
supervisor when one wasn't present.
Overall  I accept NatWest didn't deal with parts of this complaint as it should have. But for 
the reasons I have explained I'm satisfied it's paid a fair and reasonable level of 
compensation. I don't uphold Mr M's complaints about how the follow up call was dealt with 
by NatWest .
My final decision
My final decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 July 2020.
