The complaint
Mr B complains National Westminster Bank Plc unfairly closed his current account and 
withheld his funds.
What happened
The facts which led to Mr B bringing this complaint are not in dispute. But in summary:
Mr B held a current account with NatWest.
NatWest reviewed Mr Bs account in January 2021 and decided to close it 
immediately. They received a completed funds release form in February 2021 but 
didnt release the funds to Mr B due to carrying out a further review.
NatWest completed their review in July 2021 and released the funds to Mr B.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Bs complaint. They concluded:
NatWest have a broad discretion to close customers accounts. So, they could close 
Mr Bs account. They closed the account immediately which they could only do 
subject to specific account terms being met. Considering the information available 
NatWest closed the account in line with those terms.
NatWest didnt need to disclose their reasons for closing the account. Mr B was 
concerned their reasons might be discriminatory, but the available information 
showed NatWest had not treated him differently because of his ethnicity or religion.
NatWest could hold onto the funds while they carried out their review. Looking at the 
information available they had not caused an unreasonable delay carrying out their 
review.
Mr B disagreed with the outcome and asked for a final decision from an ombudsman. His 
complaint has been given to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have decided not to uphold Mr Bs complaint. Ill explain why:
NatWest have a broad commercial discretion and can close their customers 
accounts. Mr B understandably wants to know why his account was closed, but 
NatWest are under no obligation to disclose their reason(s). Neither will I be 
revealing NatWests reason(s) to Mr B by virtue of him bringing this complaint.
Mr B says hes been left to conclude NatWest targeted him because of his ethnicity 
and religion. I have not taken what he has said lightly, and certainly if NatWest closed 
his account directly or indirectly because of his ethnicity or religion this would be 
unfair. But I have considered why NatWest closed his account and Im satisfied their 
decision was legitimate and not based on his religion or ethnicity.
NatWest should still close an account in line with their terms and conditions. They 
sent Mr B a letter giving him 14 days notice before his account would close. But 
NatWest prevented Mr B from using his account during this time, which I find is 
equivalent to them closing his account immediately. I have considered the accounts 
terms in this respect and I find NatWest applied them reasonably.
NatWest have important legal and regulatory obligations they must meet when 
providing accounts to customers. To comply with their obligations, its common for 
firms to restrict access to an account to conduct a review. And considering the 
circumstances of Mr Bs complaint and the information I have available, Im satisfied 
NatWest made a reasonable decision to retain the funds in Mr Bs account.
NatWest should conduct a review and reach a decision without undue delay. After all, 
the longer a customer doesnt have access to funds, the greater the financial harm 
they may suffer. I appreciate Mr B waited approximately five months from when 
NatWest received his funds release form to when he received his funds, and this isnt 
a short length of time. I was sorry to hear that he says this caused him financial 
problems. But I have carefully considered the steps NatWest took to complete their 
review and on balance I dont find they caused an undue delay.
My final decision
I have decided not to uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2022.
