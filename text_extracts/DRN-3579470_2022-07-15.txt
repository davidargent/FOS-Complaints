The complaint
Mr O complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay), trading as Aqua, irresponsibly granted him a 
credit card account that he couldnt afford to repay. 
What happened
Mr O entered into an agreement with NewDay to have access to credit with an account that 
was opened for him in February 2018. The account had an opening credit limit of £900. 
Mr O says that NewDay didnt complete adequate affordability checks when it opened his 
account. He says that had it done so, NewDay would have seen he had a history of bad 
debt. 
NewDay didnt agree. It said that it carried out a reasonable and proportionate assessment 
to check Mr Os financial circumstances before granting him the account. 
Our adjudicator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. She thought NewDay didnt act 
unfairly or unreasonably by approving the account. 
Mr O didnt agree and so his complaint has been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. So, I dont 
consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about our approach to 
these complaints is set out on our website. 
Before granting the new account NewDay looked into Mr Os financial situation. I think 
NewDay gathered a reasonable amount of evidence and information from Mr O about his 
ability to repay his account. This included completing a credit check with credit reference 
agencies. The check showed he already had around £25,000 in unsecured borrowing and 
ongoing credit commitments. It also showed that the defaults against him were now 
historical, being around 21 months previous to the account opening. Also, it showed Mr O 
had previously had a payment arrangement with another creditor but that this was now 
settled. However, just because I think it carried out proportionate checks, it doesnt 
automatically mean it made a fair lending decision. So, Ive thought about what the evidence 
and information showed. 
Ive also looked at the other information and evidence NewDay gathered, including from his 
initial application. Having done so, Im satisfied that the checks that were completed showed 
that the agreement was likely to be affordable to Mr O. I say this because Mr Os card 
application details showed him as having an annual income of around £37,000  plus further 
household income of around £18,500 - and that he was a homeowner with a mortgage. So, 
given his financial history and the income hed declared alongside the relatively low credit 
limit hed been given, I dont think NewDay acted unfairly when approving the finance 
application. 
It follows that, having looked carefully at all the available evidence and information, I dont 
think Ive seen evidence or information that shows NewDay was unfair in allowing him to 
open the account and that regular, sustained payments on the account would be 
unaffordable. I cant reasonably conclude that at that point NewDay ought to have known he 
would struggle to make the repayments. 
Im therefore not persuaded that NewDay acted unfairly in approving the account. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2022.
