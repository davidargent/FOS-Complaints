The complaint
Miss P complains that LeasePlan UK Limited says she owes it money after she voluntarily 
terminated her conditional sale agreement.
What happened
In 2017 Miss P obtained a car through a finance agreement with LeasePlan. After she 
decided to terminate the agreement, she received three invoices from LeasePlan. One was 
for excess mileage of £453.07, one for damages of £155.00, and the third was a credit 
invoice for £558. She phoned LeasePlan and it confirmed, during the call and in a follow up 
email, that the credit was set against the amount she owed, so she only needed to pay 
£50.07. Miss P paid that amount in February 2021. But she later received correspondence 
from LeasePlan saying she still owed it money.
LeasePlan said it gave Miss P the wrong information and apologised. It said the credit was 
to be applied against two future monthly payments which would be automatically charged, 
but werent payable, following termination of the agreement. It said Miss P owed £608.07 for 
the excess mileage and damage charges. Shed paid £50.07 and LeasePlan credited her 
account with £50 for unused road tax and £150 as a gesture of goodwill. It said she therefore 
owed it £358.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She thought 
LeasePlan had done enough to put Miss P back in the position that shed be in if it hadnt 
made a mistake.
Miss P didnt agree. She said, in summary, that shes suffered a year of stress and anxiety 
because of LeasePlans mistake. And that it knows it is in the wrong because it made a 
goodwill gesture.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im sorry to disappoint Miss P, but I have come to the same conclusion as 
the investigator. Ill explain why.
LeasePlan made a mistake. It sent Miss P a credit invoice for £558. This amount wasnt due 
to Miss P, it was to be applied to her account in lieu of the next two months payments which 
its system would automatically charge, but which she wasnt due to pay following termination 
of the agreement.
Miss P phoned to seek an explanation for the credit invoice and to check how much she 
owed. Ive listened to the call and its clear LeasePlan gave her the wrong information. That 
wrong information was then repeated in an email. Miss P did ask the call handler, more than 
once, if they were sure that was correct, as she was expecting to have to pay £608.07 for 
the mileage and damage charges.
I can understand why Miss P doesnt think she should have to pay anything other than the 
£50.07 she was told was due. But, as the investigator has explained, I need to be fair to both 
parties. And my aim is to put Miss P back in the position shed be in now if LeasePlan hadnt 
made a mistake. That position would be that Miss P fairly owed LeasePlan £608.07 following 
termination of the agreement She paid it £50.07. LeasePlan credited her account with £50 
for unused road tax and £150 as a gesture of goodwill. That leaves £358 which I find Miss P 
fairly owes.
It's clear from what Miss P told us, and from what she said during the phone call with 
LeasePlan, that she is keen to always pay what she owes on time. And I can understand 
why she was so upset to be told that she still owed money, after having paid what she was 
told she owed. Whilst I dont under-estimate the anxiety this has caused her, after very 
careful consideration, I think the payment of £150 fairly compensates her for the upset 
LeasePlans mistake caused. 
Whilst I appreciate Miss P has been worrying about the amount she owes, Im pleased that 
LeasePlan put its collections process on hold whilst her complaint was being considered by 
us. Miss P didnt think she owed LeasePlan any money  because of what LeasePlan told 
her. Its likely that she may not now be able to pay the sum she owes in a lump sum. I would 
remind LeasePlan of its obligation to treat Miss P positively and sympathetically should she 
be experiencing financial difficulties, and to work with her to come to a mutually agreeable 
plan for her to repay what she owes. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 14 April 2022.
