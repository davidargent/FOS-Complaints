The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt allow him to pay funds 
from his savings account to an account with another bank. Hes also unhappy with the 
service he received.
What happened
Around July last year, Mr M contacted NatWest after being unable to use online banking to 
successfully pay funds from his savings account to an account he held with a different bank. 
Mr M was informed via webchat that he couldnt carry out this transaction through online 
banking and was advised to visit a branch to withdraw his funds.
Unhappy with this, Mr M complained to NatWest. He was also dissatisfied with the service 
he received via webchat. In its response, NatWest explained that Mr M cannot make third-
party payments from his savings account and added that he was informed of this by letter in 
2019. NatWest acknowledged that its agent couldve provided a better service and 
apologised for this. The bank reminded Mr M that he could withdraw his funds in branch.
Mr M asked this service to review his complaint. Mr M wants NatWest to remove the process 
that stops him from paying out funds from his savings account via online banking  or 
provide him with a card to facilitate this type of activity. Mr M adds that hes had his time 
wasted by the bank and had to travel to another town to visit a NatWest branch  so hed like 
the bank to reimburse him for this. Mr M also says that he didnt receive the letter NatWest 
says it sent in 2019.
One of our investigators concluded that the bank had acted fairly. Following the 
investigators assessment, Mr M expressed concerns about the timeliness of NatWests 
responses to his complaint. Our investigator felt the bank had acted in a timely manner. 
Mr M remains unhappy, so the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided that NatWest has acted fairly  Ill explain why.
Its not within my remit to direct NatWest on what processes it should follow or how it should 
conduct its banking practices  thats for the bank to decide. But I can consider whether the 
processes it has in place unfairly affects Mr M. I dont think it does. NatWest hasnt 
prevented Mr M from moving his funds, it has simply limited the way he can do so. The bank 
says Mr M can withdraw his funds in branch. I know Mr M says he needs to travel a fair 
distance to get to his closest branch, but I havent seen anything that makes me think 
NatWests suggestion to do so wouldve been unreasonable for him. So I dont find that 
NatWest acted unfairly by offering him this option. 
NatWest says it changed its process in 2019 and wrote to Mr M to let him know. The bank 
hasnt been able to provide the actual letter that was sent to Mr M, but Ive seen a version of 
it, and I can see it sets out the upcoming limitations  that Mr M wont be able to make 
payments or transfer funds from his savings account to another bank; and that new or 
replacement cards will not be issued. Although I cant say for certain that Mr M received this 
letter, Im satisfied that, on balance, the bank issued this letter to Mr M. Additionally, 
NatWest has demonstrated that it has relevant information about this process on its website. 
So Im of the view that the bank did enough to make Mr M reasonably aware of the change.
I can understand why Mr M is unhappy with the service he received from the bank via 
webchat. It seems the agent advised Mr M that they would obtain details of his closest 
branch, but then went on to end the chat. Given I havent seen anything that persuades me 
that the bank shouldve done something more to put things right, I think that NatWests 
apology is a reasonable resolution to this part of Mr Ms complaint.
I appreciate that Mr M wants to be compensated by NatWest for the time and cost of dealing 
with this matter. But I can only instruct the bank to compensate Mr M if I decide that it has 
done something wrong  which I dont find that it did. So I wont be asking NatWest to pay 
any compensation. 
Mr M has recently expressed concerns with NatWests timeliness in responding to his points 
about this issue, particularly as he followed up with the bank after its initial final response. 
However, as our investigator pointed out, it seems NatWest responded within a reasonable 
timeframe - its records demonstrate that the bank wrote to Mr M both in July and September 
last year. The former was sent via email to Mr Ms email address and the latter was sent by 
post  Ive seen a copy and it was addressed correctly. Also, Mr M hasnt indicated that hes 
had any recent problems with receiving letters from the bank. So I think, on balance, that 
Mr M likely received it.
For these reasons, Ive decided that NatWest hasnt treated Mr M unfairly by limiting the 
ability to make payments from his savings account. And Im satisfied that the banks 
response to Mr Ms complaint is appropriate. 
My final decision
Im not upholding this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 February 2023.
