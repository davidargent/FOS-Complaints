The complaint
Miss M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked and closed her accounts. 
She wasnt provided a reason for her account closing. She would like her accounts reopened 
and access to her money. 
What happened
Miss M had accounts with NatWest.
On 2 April 2021 Miss M says she was trying to make a payment of £6000 to buy bitcoin. She 
transferred money from her other accounts at different banks. Her account was blocked, and 
she was asked to come into branch to verify her ID and provide proof of entitlement of funds.
The following day she was told her account had been closed with immediate effect. She 
wasnt given a reason for the closure of the account.
NatWest says they carried out a review of Miss Ms accounts on 6 April 2021. The next day 
they sent a letter to Miss M giving her 14 days notice of closure of the accounts as per the 
terms of the accounts. NatWest said the balance in Miss Ms accounts was £411.75. Miss M 
could complete a funds release form or go into branch with Id documents to collect them. 
The accounts were to close on 26 April 2021.
Miss M complained to NatWest. They investigated but didnt uphold the complaint. The said 
their terms and conditions allowed them to close the accounts and would not give any further 
reasons for the closure.
Miss M was unhappy with NatWests response, so she complained to our service.
One of the investigators looked into her complaint. She said NatWest hadnt done anything 
wrong when they closed Miss Ms accounts. She appreciated the frustration caused to 
Miss M, but NatWest wasnt obliged to give her a reason for the closure of the accounts.
Miss M disagreed with our investigator, she said she thought that although the bank had a 
right to close her accounts, she didnt think the bank had a valid reason to do so.
As there was no agreement the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill start by setting out some context for the review of Miss Ms accounts. UK legislation 
places extensive obligations on regulated financial businesses. Financial institutions must 
establish the purpose and intended nature of transactions as well as the origin of funds, and 
there may be penalties if they dont. This applies to both new and existing relationships. 
These obligations override all other obligations. NatWest have said this is what they were 
doing when they reviewed and blocked Miss Ms accounts.
NatWest proceeded to close the accounts. A bank is entitled to close an account with a 
customer just as a customer may close an account with a bank. But before a bank closes an 
account, it must do so in a way, which complies with the terms and conditions of the 
account.
Ive considered whether NatWest acted fairly in closing Miss Ms accounts. Ive looked at the 
terms and conditions of her accounts and Im satisfied they did. The terms and conditions 
outline that the bank can close a customers account with two months notice, and in certain 
circumstances they can close an account immediately. In this case NatWest closed Miss Ms 
accounts giving her 14 days notice. For NatWest to act fairly here they needed to meet the 
criteria to apply their terms for immediate closure  and having looked at these terms and all 
the evidence Im satisfied that the bank has applied the terms fairly. And it was entitled to 
close the accounts as its already done. 
I am also satisfied that NatWest let Miss M know of their decision to close the accounts- they 
sent her a letter dated 6 April 2021. 
Having looked at the evidence I am satisfied that NatWest acted fairly and applied their 
terms correctly when they decided to close the accounts. It follows I wont be asking 
NatWest to do anything else.
Miss M said she would like access to her funds. NatWest have outlined a process, which I 
have referred to above, for Miss M to access her funds if she hasnt done so already. So, I 
will leave it up to her to contact NatWest and follow their process if she hasnt retrieved the 
funds. 
Miss M has said she wants to know the reasons why NatWest closed her accounts. Whilst 
Miss M mayve expected to be given the reasons for the account closure. NatWest isnt 
required to give her a specific reason. And I can understand Ms Ms frustration that she 
hasnt been provided a detailed explanation. But as the investigator has explained, NatWest 
is under no obligation to provide this information to her, as much as shed like to know. So, 
I cant say NatWest have done anything wrong by not giving Miss M this information. 
In summary I appreciate that Miss M feels that NatWest didnt have a valid reason to close 
her account. But having reviewed the evidence I am satisfied that NatWest acted fairly when 
they closed Miss Ms accounts. 
My final decision
For the reasons mentioned above I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 September 2021.
