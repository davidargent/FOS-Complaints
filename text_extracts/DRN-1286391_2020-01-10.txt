The complaint
Mr D, on behalf of A, a limited company complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc delayed opening 
a bank account. 
What happened
Mr D approached HSBC to open bank accounts for two linked companies. This complaint 
only deals with the attempted opening of the account for A.
On 9 March 2019, Mr D applied to open a bank account for A. It was opened on 4 April. But 
Mr D asked for the opening to be cancelled because of the length of time it took. HSBC paid 
£100 compensation for the delays. Our investigator thought this was fair. Mr D responded to 
say that he had accepted £100 in respect of the opening of A's account. But he wanted an 
ombudsman to look at this complaint so that I could see the whole picture.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I consider the amount 
HSBC has paid is fair in the circumstances of this complaint. And Mr D hasn't given any 
reasons why that amount should be increased - although he remains concerned about the 
error on the other account, which I have addressed separately.
My final decision
My final decision is that the amount already paid by HSBC UK Bank Plc of £100 is a fair and 
reasonable way to resolve this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D on behalf 
of A to accept or reject my decision before 10 February 2020.
