K820x#14complaint
Mrs and Mr D complain that they deposited  £2,000  in cash at their Bank of Scotland plc 
branch but this never appeared in their account.
background
Mrs and Mr D say they went into their local Bank  of Scotland branch in January 2019 and 
transferred £8,000 from their current account to their mortgage  account. They say they also 
deposited £2,000 in cash at the same  time.
They say it was only some time later, in April 2019,  when  they went to make another  deposit 
they realised the £2,000 had never appeared in their current account or been transferred  to 
their mortgage account, as theyd intended.
They complained to Bank of Scotland, who said there was no evidence to suggest  the 
£2,000 cash deposit was made in January 2019. So Mrs and Mr D complained to us.
Our investigator looked into it and didnt think Bank of Scotland had done anything  wrong.  
Mrs and Mr D disagreed  and asked for a final decision  from an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Bank of Scotland have no record of a £2,000  cash deposit from Mrs and Mr D on the day in 
question. 
Theyve also provided copies of their branchs cash error control records for the period in 
question. If £2,000 had been deposited but not credited to an account, this discrepancy 
would show up on those  records. The records show no discrepancies on the relevant date.
Mrs and Mr D dont have a receipt for the £2,000 deposit. They  suggested CCTV images 
might help, but the Bank pointed out they routinely keep CCTV footage for only 30 days. 
This isnt unusual. And Mrs and Mr D only raised this issue  with them in April 2019,  so any 
CCTV footage  had long since been deleted.  
In short,  theres no evidence to corroborate Mrs and Mr Ds recollection  that they deposited 
£2,000 in cash on the day in question.  And there is some evidence  the banks  cash  control 
records  to suggest they didnt.
Ive no reason to doubt that Mrs and Mr D genuinely believe they deposited £2,000  on the 
day in question. And Im sorry this has caused them worry  and stress. But given the 
available evidence, I cant conclude that Bank of Scotland have acted unfairly  or 
unreasonably in saying they wont now credit Mrs and Mr Ds mortgage account with £2,000.
