The complaint
Miss G complains TSB Bank Plc are continuing to ask her to clear arrears on her loan 
accounts when she says her loan accounts should be up to date. 
What happened
Miss G had two loan accounts with TSB. In January 2014 she took out loan *4450, for 
£3,100 over 84 months payable at £74.17. And in March 2017, loan *7312 for £1500 over 84 
months payable at £39.40. Miss G made her repayments by direct debit each month. She 
said she made the payments as usual in June 2018, but TSB say she hasnt. She referred 
her complaint to us and thought the matter had been resolved. But TSB are saying she is 
still in arrears. Miss G complained again to TSB.
TSB said Miss G made the June 2018 payments for both loans by direct debit, but a TSB 
system error meant the payments were rejected. TSB said these were reversed back to Miss 
Gs  current account. After Miss G referred her complaints to us, they agreed to refund 
payments of £74.17 and £39.40 back to Miss Gs current account, remove any charges and 
pay Miss G compensation for her trouble and upset. TSB said they refunded the two 
payments, £74.17 and £39.40 into Miss Gs current account in October 2018. And it was 
agreed, once received, Miss G would bring her loan accounts up to date. But Miss G hasnt 
done this. 
Miss G wasnt happy with TSBs response. She said she had made her monthly contractual 
payment in June 2018 and had confirmation from TSB that the payment had been made. 
She reiterated her account shouldnt be in arrears. And that TSB has caused her 
considerable distress by asking for payments that shes already made. She referred her 
complaint to us.
TSB said Miss G had now settled her loan account *4450 and that they would 
remove the arrears from her credit file. But the arrears were still outstanding £39.40 for loan 
*7312. TSB offered to re-age the loan, the effect of this would be to increase the life of the 
loan.
Our investigator said she could see the payments for the loan accounts had been made by 
Miss G in June 2018. But had been rejected by TSB. She said Miss Gs complaint about this 
had been resolved under a previous complaint brought to us that Miss G had accepted. She 
said the arears were valid and advised Miss G of the offer made by TSB.
Miss G didnt agree she said she had suffered considerably and had showed the payments 
hadnt bounced back into her account. She asked for an ombudsman to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
Miss G has provided several banks statements to show that shed made the payments in 
June 2018. Her making of the payments in June 2018 and the error caused by TSBs system 
in rejecting the payments has been considered by us in a previous decision. And how to put 
things right was accepted by both TSB and Miss G. 
I can understand Miss Gs frustration as she feels that the arrears TSB say are still 
outstanding are for the June 2018 payment, and she has provided bank statements for June, 
July and August 2018 that show the payments being made at that time. And evidence that 
the payments hadnt been reversed back to her account during these times. 
But its no longer in dispute that Miss G made the payments in June 2018 and that a TSB 
system error meant they were rejected which placed Miss Gs loan accounts into arrears. 
So, I wont comment further about this. The issue I need to consider is whether these 
payments have since been returned to her. And if they have could Miss G have used these 
payments to bring her loan accounts up to date.
TSB has shown that they refunded the June 2018 payments Miss G made to her loan 
accounts back to Miss Gs current account ending *2831 on 31 October 2018. This in effect 
meant Miss Gs June 2018 payments were negated. And Miss Gs loan accounts would 
show this as a shortfall of £74.17 and £39.40 reflecting the June 2018 payment having been 
rejected by the TSB system error. To bring the loan accounts up to date, Miss G needed to 
use the refunded payments made by TSB in October 2018 to settle the outstanding 
amounts.
I know Miss G feels strongly that her bank statements show the June 2018 payment was 
made. And that the other later bank statements shes provided dont show these payments 
being reversed. But she hasnt provided any bank statements later than August 2018 for me 
to consider. And TSB has said the refunds were paid into her current account ending *2831 
in October 2018 and Ive no reason to doubt this. So, Im satisfied TSB has calculated the 
outstanding amounts on Miss Gs loan accounts correctly.
Im pleased to hear that Miss G has settled her loan account *4450 and that TSB will update 
her credit file. But Miss G now needs to either arrange for the £39.40 shed been refunded to 
settle the outstanding amount on loan account *7312, or to work with TSB to re-age the 
account to settle the arrears that are still outstanding.My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 February 2022.
