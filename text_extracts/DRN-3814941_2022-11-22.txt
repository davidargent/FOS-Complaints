The complaint
Mr H says Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, irresponsibly lent to him.
What happened
Mr H took out a 24-month instalment loan for £2,000 from 118 118 Money in February
2019. The monthly repayment was £129.38 and the total repayable was £3,105.12.
Mr H says he was mis-sold the loan and proper checks were not carried out.
Our adjudicator said Mr Hs complaint should be upheld. He thought 118 118 Moneys
checks were proportionate, but they showed the loan would not be affordable for Mr H. 
118 118 Money replied querying the adjudicators calculations, concerned he had double 
counted Mr Hs existing credit commitments and saying Mr H would have around £600 
disposable income. 
The adjudicator reviewed the case again and confirmed that whilst the loan would have been 
affordable on a pounds and pence basis, he still felt it was not responsible to give the loan 
as Mr H was already spending a significant percentage of his income on credit. And so there 
was a high risk this loan would not be sustainably affordable. 
As 118 118 Money did not respond to this assessment and so an informal agreement was 
not reached, the complaint was passed to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to unaffordable/irresponsible lending complaints is set out on our website
and Ive followed it here.
The rules and regulations when 118 118 Money lent to Mr H required it to carry out a
reasonable and proportionate assessment of whether he could afford to repay what he
owed in a sustainable manner. This is sometimes referred to as an affordability
assessment or an affordability check.
The checks also had to be borrower-focused. So 118 118 Money had to think about
whether repaying the credit sustainably would cause any difficulties or adverse
consequences for Mr H. In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 Money to simply think
about the likelihood of it getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the
repayments on Mr H.
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of each loan application.
In general, what makes up a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount, type and cost of credit they have applied
for.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have
been more thorough:
- the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
repayments to credit from a lower level of income);
- the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet higher repayments from a particular level of income);
- the longer the period of time a borrower will be indebted for (reflecting the fact that
the total cost of the credit is likely to be greater and the customer is required to
make repayments for an extended period).
There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed a proportionate
check shouldve been for a given application  including (but not limited to) any indications of
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in future circumstances. Ive kept all of
this in mind when thinking about whether 118 118 Money did what it needed to before
agreeing to lend to Mr H. So to reach my conclusion I have considered the following
questions:
- did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks when assessing
Mr Hs loan application to satisfy itself that he would be able to repay the loan in a
sustainable way?
- if not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown?
- did 118 118 Money make a fair lending decision?
- did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
I can see 118 118 Money asked for some information from Mr H before it approved the
loan. It asked for details of his monthly income and his monthly expenditure. It says it
checked these against reasonable average figures  but it hasnt made clear if this meant it
amended what Mr H had declared. It asked about his residential status and whether he had
dependents. It asked about the purpose of the loan which was home improvements/repairs. 
It also checked Mr Hs credit file to understand his credit history and current commitments. 
From these checks combined 118 118 Money concluded Mr H had enough monthly 
disposable income to afford to repay the loan.
I think these checks were proportionate given the term and value of the loan and its monthly
repayments. But I am not persuaded the lender made a fair lending decision based on the
information it gathered. It could see from the credit check it completed that Mr H had
nine active accounts and he had told 118 118 Money he was spending £1,416 each month 
on these credit commitments. Giving this loan meant Mr H would need to spend over 40% of 
his monthly income on servicing his debt. I think 118 118 Money ought to have realised this 
meant there was a risk Mr H would not be able to sustainably repay his loan  that is, without 
needing to borrow to repay or without suffering some other adverse financial consequence. I 
think there were already early indicators his finances may have been under strain as he was 
overlimit on his revolving debt, and had used credit to withdraw cash in the prior 12 months.
It follows I think 118 118 Money was wrong to give this loan to Mr H. I havent seen any
evidence 118 118 Money acted unfairly or unreasonably in some other way towards Mr H.
Putting things right
Its reasonable for Mr H to have repaid the capital amount that he borrowed as he hadthe benefit of that money. But he has paid interest and charges on a loan that shouldnt have
been given to him. So he has lost out and 118 118 Money needs to put things right.
It should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges on the loan and treat all the payments Mr H
made as payments towards the capital.
As reworking Mr Hs loan account will result in him having effectively made payments 
above the original capital borrowed, then 118 118 Money should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from
the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Hs credit file in relation to the loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to deduct tax from this interest. 118 118 Money
should give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its deducted if he asks for one.
My final decision
I am upholding Mr Hs complaint. Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, must 
put thing right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 December 2022.
