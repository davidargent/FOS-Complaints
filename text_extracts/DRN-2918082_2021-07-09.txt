The complaint
In summary Miss A has complained about the way PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA dealt 
with a chargeback claim that was made against her by a third-party.
What happened
In 2020 Miss A sold an event ticket. The payment was made using PayPal. The purchaser of 
the ticket filed a chargeback request for the cost of the ticket.
PayPal told Miss A about this and asked if she wanted to provide any information to support 
the claim. It disputed the chargeback on Miss As behalf but explained to her that the 
decision ultimately lay with the card holder.
Miss A contacted PayPal to check if the chargeback request had been resolved. It initially 
told her that the chargeback request had been upheld in favour of the third-party. She 
explained that she had evidence that she wasnt able to submit. Miss A was then told that 
PayPal was still waiting for a decision from the bank, and it was still being reviewed.
PayPal then went on to say that it could only look at information supplied to it. It went on to 
say that it would dispute the case with the credit card company if she provided all of the 
necessary documents in its resolution centre. 
The card issuer upheld the third-party chargeback claim. Miss A didnt agree with what it 
said. In response to her complaint PayPal explained that the chargeback filed was for £21 
only. It disputed the chargeback on her behalf with the information available to it.
Miss As concerns were looked into by one of our investigators. She explained why she 
thought the complaint should be upheld in part. 
PayPal didnt agree. And after we provided it with a copy of the screenshot of the 
conversation between Miss A and the third party, it told us that it had not received this 
information.
I issued my provisional decision on 16 June 2021 explaining why I wasnt upholding Miss As 
complaint. Miss A replied explaining why she didnt agree with what I had said. In summary:
She thought her complaint had been misunderstood and not addressed at all. 
Her complaint had two elements, that she had been found culpable for a fraudulent 
transaction committed by someone else on the third party. And the way in which she 
had been treated by PayPal in relation to this matter. 
She thought it was unfair she was being ruled against due to her not being permitted 
to provide evidence. And she was concerned as she thought PayPal had missed its 
75-day deadline in relation to adjudicating on the dispute. 
She was upset that PayPal had started debt recovery proceedings against her. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I do understand Miss As frustration that her complaint hasnt been upheld.  But I dont agree 
that her complaint has been misunderstood. And having carefully thought about what she 
has said, I remain of the opinion that her complaint shouldnt be upheld. Ive set out my 
reasoning below.
 
Miss A has said that her complaint has been misunderstood. And shes summarised the 2 
key issues of concern to her that Ive set out above. 
Miss A is unhappy with the way PayPal dealt with the chargeback claim that had been made 
by a third-party purchaser, and the way it treated her. I do understand from what Miss A has 
said, why from her point of view, she feels aggrieved that the chargeback claim was upheld 
in favour of the third-party. And she perceives this to be suggesting that she has been 
culpable of a fraudulent transaction. 
But, as I explained in my provisional decision, PayPal isnt responsible for deciding whether 
the chargeback claim should be upheld or not. That is a matter for the card issuer to decide, 
not PayPal. But PayPal did need to provide any relevant information to the card issuer in 
relation to the chargeback claim. And Miss A is also unhappy with how PayPal treated her in 
relation to this chargeback claim. But I dont think its treated her unfairly.
I say this because PayPal has provided a copy of an e-mail it says it sent to Miss A. This 
sets out the potential reasons for the dispute and the amount in dispute. The e-mail also 
asks Miss A to provide any additional information to help resolve the case, by logging into 
her PayPal account and going to its resolution centre. So, it does appear that PayPal asked 
Miss A for any relevant information.
Miss A has said that she tried to provide evidence to PayPal but wasnt able to do so. Ive 
considered the screenshots that have been provided in relation to the online conversations 
between Miss A and PayPal. Ive also seen the screenshots in relation to the conversation 
between Miss A and the third-party. 
During the conversation between PayPal and Miss A and after Miss A tells it that she had 
tried to provide evidence to it, PayPal explains that the case was still being reviewed. And it 
says it would dispute the case with the credit card company, if Miss A provided the 
necessary documents in the resolution centre. Miss A then goes on to query the £14 dispute 
fee. And in response, the customer service representative confirms what she had been told 
earlier about this by the previous representative. Miss As response was that she didnt have 
anything further at that time. 
I accept what Miss A has said about having problems providing evidence to PayPal. But it 
appears that after she had those problems, she was reminded of the opportunity to provide 
further information. And I note that having been reminded of that opportunity and how to go 
about doing that, she doesnt appear to have queried how to go about providing further 
evidence. So, considering the problems she says she had, I think this was an opportunity for 
her to ask PayPal how she could provide further evidence, possibly in a different way. 
Although Miss A does appear to have had evidence that might have supported her defence 
of the chargeback claim, PayPal has said that it has no record of having received the 
screenshots of the chat between Miss A and the third-party. And from what Miss A has said, it doesnt look like that information was sent to PayPal. And in her response to my 
provisional decision I note that Miss A hasnt commented on what I said here. 
Miss A has also said her complaint was also about debt recovery proceedings being started 
against her by PayPal. Our investigator said that they couldnt comment on that, as she 
didnt have any information. And I note that in her response to the investigators view Miss A 
said:
Thanks for sending me your findings  I totally agree with what youve said and I really 
appreciate the time youve spent on this. 
I think that given what the investigator had said in her view, if Miss A felt that not all her 
complaint points had been addressed, she would have said so in her response to the 
investigators view. And on her complaint form in the describing what happened section, she 
sets out her dissatisfaction with how PayPal handled the chargeback claim made against 
her, and that she believed it ignored evidence that would have helped her successfully 
defend the claim. And she only mentions the reference to a debt collection agency in the 
section describing how she had been affected. 
So, when looking at everything together I remain of the opinion that the crux of Miss As 
complaint is about the chargeback claim. For the avoidance of any doubt, Ive not 
considered the debt collection agency issue in this decision. And Ive also noted that PayPal 
didnt address this in its final response to Miss A. So, if Miss A wants to pursue that issue 
further, she can raise this specifically with PayPal. 
In conclusion, given what Ive said, I dont think PayPal has done anything wrong in respect 
of defending the chargeback claim. If PayPal didnt have the information Miss A wanted to 
rely on, it couldnt give that to the card issuer. Miss A has said that PayPal has refunded her 
the £14 dispute fee. So, for the reasons Ive given, I dont think it needs to do anything else. I 
do understand that Miss A will be disappointed with my decision, but I hope she understands 
why I wont be upholding her complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive set out above, my decision is not to uphold Miss As complaint. Under 
the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept or reject 
my decision before 6 August 2021.
