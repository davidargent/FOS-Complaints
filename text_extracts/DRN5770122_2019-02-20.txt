K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs S say Lloyds Bank  PLC (Lloyds)  mis-sold them  a Select, Gold (twice) and 
Platinum packaged  bank accounts. Theyve  used a Claims Management Company (CMC) 
to complain.
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr and Mrs S complaint  and didnt think Lloyds had
mis-sold the accounts.  The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr and Mrs Ss complaint.  
Having carefully looked  at everything  provided,  Im not upholding Mr and Mrs S complaint. 
Id like to explain the reasons for my decision. I think Mr and Mrs S chose to take the 
accounts at the respective times. They appear  to have  had identifiable  needs  for the main  
benefits and they couldve used some  of them such as the breakdown  cover  and travel  
insurance too. And it looks like the cheapest account including the benefits Mr and Mrs S 
had a want and need for was recommended at the respective times too.  
So overall I dont  think that clearer information wouldve changed Mr and Mrs S decision to 
accept what looks to have  been  fair recommendations made  by Lloyds. And, in these 
circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr and Mrs S complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision  before  20 March  2019.
