The complaint
Mr W complained because PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA refused to credit him with money 
for goods which hed sold online.
What happened
 On 8 April 2020, Mr W sold some trainers online for £325. He received the money so he 
sent them using a delivery companys recorded delivery service. The trainers were shown as 
Delivered by the delivery company on 14 April. 
But on 29 April, the buyer then said he hadnt ordered the trainers, and raised a claim for the 
£325 to be refunded to him.
PayPal asked Mr W to provide proof of shipment or delivery, in order to be covered by its 
seller protection.  The delivery company had given Mr W two numbers, and 8 digit one and a 
16 digit one. Mr W gave PayPal the 8 digit number.
PayPal checked the tracking number and didnt get a result. It turned out the right number 
should have been the 16 digit number. PayPal didnt query this with Mr W, and the claim was 
settled the claim in favour of the buyer. The £325 was debited from Mr Ws account and Mr 
Ws claim was closed. Mr W contacted this service.
After we became involved in June 2020, PayPal issued a final response letter to Mr W on 22 
September. It said that the User Agreement said that to be eligible for seller protection, Mr W 
had to provide proof of shipment or delivery. The number Mr W had provided wasnt valid. 
The final response said that if Mr W did have a valid tracking number, PayPal would carry 
out another review.
Our investigator asked Mr W if hed provided the longer tracking number in response to the 
final response letter. But Mr W said hed never received PayPals final response letter, and 
PayPal had just closed his case straightaway.
Our investigator contacted PayPal again, and attached Mr Ws information with both tracking 
numbers and delivery confirmation. But PayPal said it had acted in line with its User 
Agreement, and wouldnt refund Mr W. It acknowledged the investigator had sent another 
tracking number on 29 April 2021, but this hadnt been provided at the time. It was now over 
a year since Mr Ws case had been closed. And the tracking number said invalid on the 
delivery companys website.
The investigator upheld Mr Ws complaint. He said that the delivery companys tracking 
numbers were re-used after 90 days, but Mr W had had proof of shipment or delivery at 
the time.  He pointed out that PayPal hadnt made any further attempts to clarify the tracking 
number, and said that from PayPals user agreement, it appeared that Mr W would then 
have been eligible for seller protection.  So he considered PayPal should pay Mr W the £325 
it had reclaimed.
PayPal didnt agree and asked for an ombudsmans decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
  Its true that Mr W provided PayPal with an incorrect tracking number. But the format of the 
number Mr W provided was clearly wrong. It was 8 digits including a letter and numbers, 
whereas the right format was 16 digits, all of which were numbers. The delivery company 
was a large and well-known one, so I think its likely PayPal would have dealt many times 
with tracking numbers from that firm. So I consider that it would have been good service for 
PayPal to have explained to Mr W that this was an incorrect number, and to have given an 
example of the right type of number, or more information about what he should have 
provided.
If PayPal had done this, I think its more likely than not, in all the circumstances, that Mr W 
would have received a refund. This is because Ive seen the 16 digit tracking number, and 
its on the delivery firms document showing the recipients name, postcode, date of the 
order, how much Mr W paid, and, importantly, Delivery status Delivered. Ive also seen the 
delivery firms other document with the misleading 8 digit number, next to a barcode. So I 
consider Mr W made a genuine mistake in submitting the wrong one of two numbers. And 
the evidence indicates that its more likely than not that he died indeed send the trainers to 
the stated recipient and that he received a delivered confirmation. 
I appreciate PayPals point that when it tried the correct 16 digit tracking number in mid-
2021, it showed as invalid. Thats because the delivery firm re-uses numbers after 90 days, 
so Mr Ws correct tracking number would probably have been re-used several times since 
April 2020. But we dont always have all the evidence wed like, and when that happens I 
take my decision on the basis of what I think it most likely to have happened, taking into 
account all the circumstances of the case. And here, the delivery company documents 
including the recipients name and postcode, make me think its most likely that Mr W did 
genuinely send the trainers to the stated recipient, within the timescales set, and that he had 
a delivery confirmation. 
Mr W had this documentary evidence at the time, and he submitted what turned out to be the 
wrong code within the set timescales. If PayPal had contacted Mr W when he provided the 8 
digit code, I consider Mr Ws claim would have been upheld and the £325 wouldnt have 
been debited.  So I find that PayPals sticking rigidly to its process resulted in an unfair 
outcome in the individual circumstances of Mr Ws case.
My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA 
to pay Mr W £325 representing the amount it debited from his account for the disputed 
transaction.. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 August 2021.
