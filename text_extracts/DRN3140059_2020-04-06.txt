K821x#15complaint
Miss B complains  BW Legal Services Limited (BW Legal) incorrectly recorded  late payments 
on her account, provided misleading and inaccurate  information and treated her unfairly. She 
asks for an apology and compensation  for the trouble and upset this matter  has caused.
background
In January 2017 BW Legal wrote  to Miss B advising they had been instructed by their client, 
a third party, to recover  and outstanding balance and asked Miss B to contact them  to 
discuss her account.
On 20 May 2017, Miss B contacted BW Legal, apologised for the delay in responding, and 
explained her reasons  for this. Miss B accessed the BW Legal online portal, to propose a 
repayment arrangement  of £20 per month.
On 22 June 2017, BW Legal wrote to Miss B accepting the payment proposal and confirming 
the start date would be 17 July 2017.  It also informed Miss B that it had secured a County 
Court Judgement, but had agreed to set aside the judgement in the circumstances. It also 
sent an Acceptance  of Payment letter on the same  day. It confirmed the first payment was 
due on 17 July 2017 and payment would be due on the 17th of each month thereafter.
On 28 June 2017, Miss B accessed  the online portal  and amended  the monthly payments to 
remain at £20.00 per month but to be paid on 31st of the month. Miss B says this was due to 
the date her salary  was paid. This request  remained pending on the portal.
Miss B then made the following payments towards the following payment dates, as she 
understood it:
30/06/2017 £20.00 payment due 17/07/2017
31/07/2017 £20.00 payment due 17/08/2017
01/09/2017 £20.00 payment due 17/09/2017
04/10/2017 £20.00 payment due 17/10/2017
01/11/2017 £20.00 payment due 17/11/2017
01/12/2017 £20.00 payment due 17/12/2017
27/12/2017 £20.00 payment due 17/01/2018
01/02/2018 £20.00 payment due 17/02/2018
28/02/2018 £20.00 payment due 17/03/2018
30/03/2018 £20.00 payment due 17/04/2018
01/05/2018 £20.00 payment due 17/05/2018
02/06/2018 £20.00 payment due 17/06/2018
29/06/2018 £20.00 payment due 17/07/2018
31/07/2018 £20.00 payment due 17/08/2018
05/09/2018 £20.00 payment due 17/09/2018
28/09/2018 £20.00 payment due 17/10/2018
31/10/2018 £60.00 payment due 17/11/2018
On 20 November 2018, BW Legal wrote to Miss B advising her payment due on 17/11/2018 
hadnt been received. Miss B contacted BW Legal  very confused by the letter. She felt she 
had been paying her account in advance, she had received no correspondence previously to 
say she was making later payments and so couldnt understand why, having  paid an 
Ref: DRN31400592additional amount towards her account, BW Legal were  advising a payment had been 
missed.
In its final response,  dated 4 February  2019, BW Legal advised Miss B her payment 
arrangement started on 17 July 2017. It said the first payment made on 30 June was a one 
off payment  and since then payments  havent been  made in line with the agreed 
arrangement. But it did agree  that a number  of matters concerning Miss Bs payment 
arrangement could have been  explained  better and issues resolved more promptly.  It 
apologised and explained  the information  Miss B had provided would be brought  to the 
attention of any representatives  involved and any additional  training required would be 
provided.
Miss B was unhappy  with BW Legals response  and asked this service to look into things for 
her.
An investigator looked carefully at all the information  provided  by both parties.  She issued 
her first view partially upholding Miss Bs complaint. She listened to the telephone call 
between Miss B and BW Legal  and found  the representative to be dismissive and 
unhelpful. She thought if things had been explained properly it would have  helped  Miss B 
understand its position and could have de-escalated the situation. Whilst she agreed  the 
payments hadnt  been made  on the 17th of each  month, she found no evidence to suggest  
BW Legal  had brought this to Miss Bs attention  nor had any expected documentation such 
as a notice of account in arrears letter been  sent.
She found, based on BW Legals submissions that it considered Miss Bs account to have 
been in arrears since August 2017, but didnt advise Miss B of this until November  2018.  
She said if BW Legal had notified Miss B earlier, she would have had the opportunity  to bring 
her account  back into line. She could  see this had caused Miss B trouble and upset and 
asked BW Legal to pay Miss B £100 in recognition of this.
Miss B made further submissions. She said she had made the first payment after the 
Arrangement to Pay letter  was sent. She said this wasnt a one off payment but in fact, the 
first instalment and it was made before the due date of 17 July 2017. She had also 
requested the date of the payment arrangement be amended to the end of the month. She 
had no response  to this request, and so she continued to make  the payments accordingly.  
As BW Legal didnt  query  this for over a year, she had no way of knowing it considered her 
account to be in arrears.
Our investigator looked at the information again  and agreed.  She amended her view from a 
partial uphold  to a full uphold and asked BW Legal  to pay Miss B £100  in recognition of the 
trouble and upset  caused.
Miss B accepted  our investigators findings.  
BW Legal  didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive looked at all the information from both 
parties afresh. Having  done so, Im in agreement with the investigators view. Ill explain why.
Ref: DRN31400593Ive read and considered the whole  file, but Ill concentrate my comments  on what I think  is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on 
board and think about it but because I dont think  I need  to comment on it in order  to reach 
what I think is the right outcome. 
Firstly, I think its important to say my role here is to look at the actions  BW Legal  have  taken 
in the circumstances of this complaint  and determine if they were fair and reasonable and if 
not what steps it should take to put things right. Im not able to direct  BW Legal  to alter or 
amend its internal process or payment schedules.
The confusion appears to have arisen right at the beginning. Miss B wanted to make  her 
payments towards  the end of the month when she receives her salary and BW Legal agreed 
to a payment  arrangement to be made on 17th of the month,  which it confirmed in its 
acceptance of payment  arrangement letter dated  22 June 2017. This stated the first payment 
should be made .on or before 17th July 2017 and monthly  on the same date thereafter..
Miss B made the first payment on 30 June  2017.  This was after she received the acceptance 
of payment arrangement letter and before the due date of 17th July. It also is entirely 
consistent with the approach she says she wanted  to take, making  a payment at the end of 
the month when she received her salary.
I appreciate BW Legal have said they understood this payment to be a one-off.  This would 
mean that the payment  made on 31st July 2017 it considered  the first payment and by 
definition paid late. Miss B on the other hand  understood it to be her second  payment and 
paid in advance. The payments continued  over a year with Miss B thinking she was ahead of 
schedule and BW Legal  finding  her payments to be late or erratic.
Ive looked carefully  at the online portal Miss B accessed and made a request to change the 
payment date to the end of the month and pay by direct debit. This request wasnt  actioned  
by BW Legal  and so by definition wasnt agreed. But it also didnt  bring what it considered  
late payments to Miss Bs attention for over a year. It didnt send any notice of arrears letters  
to Miss B so I can understand why she was confused and upset when BW Legal advised her 
it considered her account to be in arrears in November 2018.
Ive listened to the telephone call between Miss B and BW Legal from November 2018.  BW 
Legal has acknowledged their representative ...didnt provide Miss B with correct  
information during  the call  ...and could have explained matters more clearly.
There are a number of instances  in addition to the telephone call, where the customer  
service provided fell short of BW Legals expectations and it has apologised accordingly. I 
understand that a direct  debit for an agreed amount  on a suitable payment schedule  has 
now been set up. 
Taking everything into account,  if this had been done much  sooner, and if BW Legal had 
provided more clarity on the situation,  Miss B wouldve  had an opportunity  to rectify this 
matter. In failing  to do so, Im persuaded B W Legal  caused Miss B unnecessary trouble and 
upset for which she should  be compensated.
my final decision
For the reasons  I have  given Im upholding this complaint and I direct BW Legal Services 
Limited to:
Ref: DRN31400594Pay Miss B £100 for the trouble  and upset caused.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 May 2020.
