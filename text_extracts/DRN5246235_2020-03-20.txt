K821x#15complaint
Mr C says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading as Sunny - irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about eight instalment loans Sunny  provided  to Mr C between August and 
November 2016.  Mr Cs borrowing history  is as follows:
Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Repayment
1 04/08/2016 16/08/2016 6 £400.00 £111.56
2 19/08/2016 15/09/2016 6 £400.00 £123.18
3 18/09/2016 27/09/2016 6 £400.00 £123.26
4 21/09/2016 27/09/2016 6 £200.00 £183.79
5 23/09/2016 27/09/2016 6 £150.00 £228.61
6 27/09/2016 14/10/2016 6 £400.00 £116.53
7 16/10/2016 15/11/2016 6 £400.00 £132.45
8 19/11/2016 15/12/2016 6 £400.00 £129.08
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Cs complaint and thought  loans 7 and 8 shouldnt have 
been given because the overall pattern of Mr Cs borrowing indicated  he was reliant on these 
loans and the borrowing was becoming unsustainable. Sunny  didnt  respond  to the 
adjudicators view. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider a number of different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN52462352the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint. Having done  so, I am partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Cs complaint  about loans 1 to 6. Mr C hasnt provided any 
further evidence  or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further findings 
on these loans because  they no longer appear  to be in dispute. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr C was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr C had taken out seven loans in just over two months  and often had 
more than one loan already running  with Sunny  when he took out further  borrowing. 
So, it should  have  realised it was more likely than not Mr C was having to borrow  
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Cs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr Cs first loan was for £400 and the seventh loan was for the same  amount. Mr C 
also took out loan 8 only five days after paying  off loan 7. And this was also for £400. 
At this point Sunny ought to have known it was unlikely he was borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  8 was 
taken out three months after Mr Cs first. And it was for the same amount. Mr C had 
Ref: DRN52462353paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect; service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Cs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 7 and 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 and 8 should be removed from  
Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Elevate Credit International Limited  to take off tax from this 
interest. Elevate Credit  International  Limited must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its 
taken off if he asks for one. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 April 2020.
