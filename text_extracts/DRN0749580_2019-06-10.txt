K821x#15complaint
Mr O says CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid lent to him irresponsibly.  He says he 
spent almost three years trapped  in a borrowing cycle and the overwhelming  amount of 
loans came from QuickQuid. He says QuickQuid  shouldnt have approved these loans.  
background
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be partially upheld. QuickQuid disagreed with 
the adjudicators  opinion.  The complaint was then passed to me. 
I issued my provisional decision saying that Mr Os complaint should  be upheld  in part. 
A copy of the background to the complaint and my provisional findings are attached and 
form part of this final decision. 
QuickQuid, and Mr O, confirmed  that they had received my provisional decision. Mr O 
agreed with what I said.
QuickQuid didnt agree with my provisional  decision.  It said that:
it provided  some  information about  the checks it had made,  it said these showed that Mr 
O could sustainably  repay his loans
Mr O had a good repayment history
it couldnt have reasonably known that Mr O was gambling and I didnt provide detailed 
income and expenditure statements that show the loans werent  affordable 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In response to my provisional decision QuickQuid reiterated what  it had provided earlier  
about the checks it made and what these showed. 
But I had already considered this information and so it doesnt change  my decision  about 
loans 3a and 3b. And I still think that the checks QuickQuid made before approving  these 
loans werent proportionate. If it had made  better checks  then it wouldve seen that Mr O 
couldnt sustainably  afford the repayments  to these loans.  This was largely due to the fact 
that his expenditure - including on other short term lending  and gambling   was already high 
in relation to his income.
I outlined in my in my provisional decision why I thought that Mr Os pattern of lending was 
indicative of financial problems. I still think this is the case for the same  reasons I gave in my 
earlier decision. 
QuickQuid has pointed  to Mr Os good repayment  history. But he was borrowing and 
repaying high amounts  over time without a break. I think this led to him having a hole in his 
finances and he needed to borrow again  to cover this. So I think the lending  pattern itself is 
evidence of him being unable to sustainably repay these loans. And so I dont need to 
recreate individual  proportionate checks for loans 4 to 13a.  
Ref: DRN07495802So my final decision is the same as I outlined in my earlier  decision  and for the same  
reasons. 
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr O paid on loans 3a to 13a;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative  information about  loans 3a and 3b from Mr Os credit file;
the number of loans  taken from loan 4 means any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about loans 4 to 13a should be removed from Mr Os credit file
If Mr O still owes QuickQuid any of the principal balance he borrowed on his final loan 
QuickQuid should  remove all the interest  and charges applied  to the outstanding balance. 
QuickQuid should  then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Mr O went  to 
towards the principal.  But importantly, QuickQuid needs to make  sure that Mr O doesnt  
repay more  than the principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Mr O hasnt repaid  the principal he borrowed QuickQuid can deduct  this 
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr O has already paid enough to repay the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple*  interest from the 
date of payment  to the date of settlement. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
And if QuickQuid no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the 
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr O.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Os complaint. CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 July 2019.

Ref: DRN07495803extract from my provisional  decision
This complaint is about  13 payday  loans  provided  to Mr O between November 2014 and July 2017. 
Some of the information QuickQuid has provided  is in a table at the end of this decision. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Os complaint and thought the loans 3a to 4a, 7b, 7c, 8a to 10 and 11a to 
13b shouldnt  have been  given. QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to provisionally decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website  and Ive 
taken this into account in deciding  Mr Os case. 
Ive provisionally decided to uphold  Mr Os complaint in part and Ive explained why below.
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr O could repay  his loans 
in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and Mr Os income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages  of 
a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  indicate that a lender should fairly and reasonably have done more to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion of their income 
the amount, or amounts, due to be repaid are higher  
there is a larger number or higher  frequency of loans  
the period  of time during which a customer and business have a lending relationship is long
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind,  I think that there are three key questions for me to consider in order to fairly 
and reasonably determine  Mr Os complaint. These questions are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy  itself 
that Mr O would be able to repay in a sustainable  way?  If not, would those  checks have shown 
that Mr O would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans  provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Os indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  all of these questions and what they mean  for Mr Os complaint.
did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate  checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr O would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr O would have been able to do so?
Mr O didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion  about  loans  1 to 3. Because  of this I dont think 
there is any ongoing disagreement about  these  loans. So I wont be making a decision about this 
lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Mr O had with QuickQuid.  So they are 
something I will take into account when considering  the other loans he took.
Ref: DRN07495804By loan 3a Mr O, and QuickQuid, had a lending relationship for around three and a half months.  Loan 
3a was scheduled to take this up to around five months. The amounts  borrowed were also relatively 
high. Mr O borrowed  £450  in total by loan 3a, and a further £150 for loan 3b. The highest repayment 
for loan 3b was over half of Mr Os declared income. 
So I think that it wouldve  been proportionate for QuickQuid  to fully review Mr Os financial situation  
before approving this loan.  And I think that it needed to verify this information, as far as it could, to get 
an accurate picture  of Mr Os finances. This was to make sure Mr O was in position to make the 
repayments sustainably.
I dont think QuickQuid  did this. As far as I can see it asked Mr O about his income and expenditure  and 
largely relied on this. I can see that it also found out some information from credit reference agencies.  
So I need to think about what QuickQuid wouldve seen if it had carried  out proportionate checks. 
Mr O has provided some information about his financial  circumstances; this includes some of his bank 
statements and a recent  credit report. I accept that this isnt exactly  what  QuickQuid wouldve  seen at 
the time. But I think it wouldve found out similar information if it had made proportionate checks, so I 
think its reasonable  to rely on it.
I can see that his monthly income was around £1,200 before he took these loans. And his expenditure  
was around £600. But, as our adjudicator outlined, Mr O was borrowing  and repaying significant 
amounts to other short term lenders. This looked to be around £400 a month. 
And by this stage, proportionate  checks wouldve also shown QuickQuid that a substantial portion  of 
Mr Os income  was going on gambling. And I think that if QuickQuid  wouldve seen this, it wouldnt 
have thought  it was responsible to lend to Mr O.
I think  that QuickQuid  wouldve found out this information if it had made  proportionate checks.  And I 
think it wouldve seen  Mr O wouldnt  have been able repay loans  3a and 3b in a sustainable way. So I 
think that QuickQuid  shouldnt have given loans 3a and 3b to Mr O and I think  hes lost out as a result 
of this. So Im upholding  Mr Os complaint about these loans. 
I havent recreated  individual proportionate checks for loans 4 to 13a because I dont think  that it is 
necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case in the next section.
taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Os indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise  harmful?
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of lending.  Ive looked to see if there was a point at which  
QuickQuid should reasonably have seen that further  lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. 
And so QuickQuid shouldve realised that it shouldnt have  provided any further lending. Given  the 
particular circumstances of Mr Os case, I think that this point was reached by loan 4. I say this because:
the amounts Mr O was borrowing were  generally increasing, or remaining very high in relation to 
his income. Mr O borrowed £600 in total for loan 4, £800 for loan 11 and £850 for loan 12. 
QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was likely his indebtedness was increasing unsustainably
Mr O wasnt really reducing the amount  he owed QuickQuid. He was in effect paying  large 
amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended period. QuickQuids records show that 
he borrowed over a period of 2.7 years. He received  £6,100  in loans he paid £3,210.81 in 
interest and charges over this period. 
I think  that Mr O lost out because QuickQuid continued  to approve loans from loan 4 onwards  
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging  Mr Os indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit over an extended period of time
Ref: DRN07495805the sheer  number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Os ability to 
access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost  loans
So Im upholding Mr Os complaint about loans  4 to 13a because the overall pattern of lending increased  
his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and hes lost out as a result.
I can see that QuickQuid  responded  at length to our adjudicators opinion. It has also provided a full 
description of its lending process after 2015. This Service has responded  to QuickQuid on these  largely 
generic arguments directly  and through earlier final decisions. And the finding  I am intending to make 
isnt affected  by the checks  QuickQuid made for much  of the lending.  So I am not going to expand  on 
this point any further  here, though  I have  considered  it alongside everything else in making my decision.
did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably in some other  way?
Ive carefully thought about  everything provided. Having  done  so, Ive not seen anything  here that 
leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards  Mr O in some other way.
