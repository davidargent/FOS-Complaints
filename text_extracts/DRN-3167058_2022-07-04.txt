DRN-3167058
The complaint
Mr D complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA mishandled his claim for items that 
were ordered and paid for using his PayPal account, but which werent received.
What happened
Mr D ordered some plants via an online marketplace website. He paid for the goods using 
his PayPal account. Mr D says that the plants never arrived and so he contacted the seller 
who informed him that the postal services tracking number for the goods showed they had 
been delivered to his address.
Mr D says he was advised by both the seller and the online marketplace website to contact 
the postal service that had been used and raise a complaint. However, when Mr D did so, 
the postal service told him that it was for the sender to raise a claim for compensation for 
items that werent delivered.
Mr D raised a claim with PayPal for items not received. PayPal said that as the seller had 
provided proof that the plants had been delivered, Mr Ds claim wasnt eligible for PayPal 
Buyer Protection and no reimbursement was due. It closed his claim.
Mr D complained to PayPal about its decision. He said that there wasnt proof the items had 
been delivered as the postal service had been unable to confirm where the plants had been 
actually delivered to. Mr D said that under legislation the obligation was on the seller to 
ensure goods were delivered.
PayPal then opened a claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in respect of 
Mr Ds claim. Mr D says he was asked to provide documentation to support this claim. 
However, this claim was declined because the cost of the plants was less than £100 and so 
didnt meet the criteria set out by the section. Mr D says he was misled by PayPal taking this 
action.
Mr D complained about PayPals handling of his claim to this service. He said that following 
PayPal closing his claim it had failed to open a complaint though hed asked it to do so 
repeatedly; that he had never requested that a section 75 claim be opened and that in any 
event PayPal should have been aware this wasnt applicable and that PayPals policy in 
respect of a claim for items not received was unfair. 
Our investigator recommended that Mr Ds complaint should be partially upheld. He said that 
as evidence of the delivery of the plants to Mr Ds address had been provided, he couldnt 
reasonably say that they hadnt been. The shipping information and the address were 
correct and the postal services tracking system had recorded their delivery. He noted that 
there had been no requirement at the time for signatures to be provided due to the covid 
situation.  
Our investigator said that it was outside of this services remit to look at complaints about 
how a business had handled a complaint as this didnt fall under regulated activity. He also 
said that this service wasnt able to comment on or assess policies put in place by a 
business. Our investigator said he wouldnt therefore be able to assess the credibility or 
fairness of a policy put in place by PayPal when dealing with claims for items not being 
received.
However, our investigator said he thought Mr D had been treated unfairly by PayPal when it 
had attempted to pursue a claim under section 75. He said PayPal should have been aware 
that Mr Ds claim wouldnt qualify because it didnt meet the criteria of an item costing £100 
or above.  Our investigator recommended that Mr D receive £100 compensation for the 
distress and inconvenience caused to him by PayPal unnecessarily opening a section 75 
claim and seeking further documentation from him.
PayPal disagreed with our investigators view. It said that it had opened a section 75 claim at 
Mr Ds request. PayPal also said that under the terms and conditions of a PayPal account 
which Mr D had signed, then its decision under a claim for Buyer Protection was final. It said 
it was clear under the conditions for making a claim for an item not received that if a seller 
provided proof of a delivery then PayPal may find in the sellers favour and the claim would 
not be eligible for a refund.
As the parties werent able to reach an agreement the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen that Mr D felt that the processes in place by PayPal when assessing his claim for 
items not received were unfair and one-sided. He says that relying on the evidence provided 
by the postal service wasnt sufficient for PayPal to be able to say the items had been 
delivered.
PayPal says that the process it follows when there is a claim under the PayPal Buyer 
Protection scheme is set out in the terms of the PayPal user agreement. And that all users 
must accept and agree to the terms of this agreement when opening a PayPal account. 
When a claim is made for items Not Received, the policy sets out a claim will not qualify if 
the seller provides proof of delivery. And if the seller presents evidence that they delivered 
the goods then PayPal may find in favour of the seller for an item Not Received claim even 
if you claim you did not receive the goods. So, I think its reasonable to say under this policy 
its for PayPal to exercise its discretion about whether it accepts the claim or not.
Looking at the evidence that has been produced as to the delivery of the plants to Mr D, I 
accept theres no photo evidence that definitely establishes where the plants were delivered. 
But I think there is enough evidence to say its likely the plants were delivered to the correct 
address. The shipping and tracker information have all the correct details. I think PayPals 
decision was reasonable and in line with its policy.
I appreciate Mr D feels this policy is one way and puts the buyer in a difficult position. But, as 
explained by our investigator, it isnt in this services remit to look at businesses policies as 
that is a matter for the Financial Conduct Authority. So, I cant comment or assess the 
fairness of the policy itself, only look at whether it has been reasonably and fairly applied.  I 
think it has here and Mr Ds claim was found to be ineligible for a refund.
PayPal says that Mr D asked for his claim to be considered under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974. Section 75 may apply when the goods purchased via a 
credit agreement cost over £100 and up to a limit of £30,000. The general effect of the 
section is that if a consumer has paid for goods or services with a credit agreement and they have a claim against the supplier of those goods or services for 
misrepresentation or breach of contract, they are given a like claim against the credit 
provider, which here is PayPal. 
However, looking at the contact notes between Mr D and PayPal, I havent seen that 
Mr D made this request. He only raised the Consumer Credit Act in relation to PayPals 
failure to register his complaint. So, PayPal appears to have misunderstood what he 
said. 
I think its reasonable to say it was PayPals decision to then open a section 75 claim 
for Mr D. Paypal also asked him to provide further information. But, because of the 
amount Mr D had paid for the plants (less than £100) the claim didnt fit the criteria. 
This action has caused Mr D unnecessary distress and inconvenience since its 
reasonable to say that PayPal should have been aware that this claim would always 
have been unsuccessful in these circumstances.
Mr D has also been frustrated by the way PayPal handled his complaint regarding the 
way it had dealt with his claim for a refund. However, again as explained by our 
investigator, complaint handling isnt something I can necessarily look at as it isnt a 
regulated activity. Our rules as to what we can and cant look out are set out in the 
rules provided by the FCA and are known as the DISP rules. Here, Im satisfied that Mr 
Ds complaint that PayPal had failed to correctly log his complaint is outside of what I 
can consider.
So, although I appreciate Mr D has found the way PayPal handled his claim upsetting 
and frustrating, I cant fairly say that PayPal incorrectly and unreasonably dealt with his 
claim over the items not being received by him. However, I do think PayPal acted 
unfairly when it raised a section 75 claim and asked him for further information about 
that when it wasnt appropriate. I think its fair for PayPal to pay Mr D compensation for 
the distress and inconvenience this caused him. 
Ive seen PayPal disagreed with Mr D receiving a payment of £100 as recommended 
by our investigator. However, I was unclear whether it had considered this amount 
represented reimbursement for the plants as opposed to being compensation for the 
mishandling of the section 75 claim. But I think compensation of £100 is fair for the 
impact caused to Mr D by PayPal pursuing an inappropriate section 75 claim after 
finding that he was ineligible for a refund under the PayPal Buyer Protection scheme. 
So, for the reasons given Im partially upholding Mr Ds complaint. 
Putting things right
Im asking PayPal to pay Mr D £100 compensation for the impact on him by its opening a 
section 75 claim when this wasnt appropriate.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, Im partially upholding Mr Ds complaint. Im asking PayPal 
(Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to pay Mr D £100 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience caused to him by opening a section 75 when he did not request this, and it 
wasnt appropriate in the circumstances.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 August 2022.
