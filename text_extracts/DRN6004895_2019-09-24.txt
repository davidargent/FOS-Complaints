K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that NewDay Ltd was irresponsible in increasing his limit on his credit card. 
He feels that this has played a part in the financial difficulties hes been  experiencing.
background
Mr C took out a credit card provided  by NewDay  in March 2017. His credit  limit was £300.
NewDay wrote to Mr C a few months  later to say that it had looked at how hed managed his 
credit card and said it would increase his credit limit to £1,300. This would increase 
automatically after 40 days, or Mr C could  call NewDay  to start it straight away or let it know 
that he didnt want the increase.
Mr C chose not to contact NewDay and his higher limit was automatically applied to his 
account in July 2017.
In 2019, Mr C complained. He felt that hed started off with a low and manageable credit limit 
but said the sudden jump  in his credit limit had meant that his debts had become difficult to 
manage. Mr C said he thought NewDay  shouldve  realised  that he was struggling as hed 
been up to the original  limit of his account.  Hed taken out a loan to repay a large part of the 
balance in June  2018, and thinks NewDay shouldve contacted him to see if he wanted  to 
lower his limit then, as this wouldve stopped  him from getting into further debt.  He asked for 
NewDays help by writing  off some of his balance.
NewDay said it had offered Mr C a credit limit increase in line with its policy  and suggested 
ways that he could monitor his balance and repay  it. As a gesture of goodwill, it removed 
£40.51 in interest from Mr Cs account.
One of our investigators  looked at the complaint but didnt think it should  be upheld. He said 
that NewDay had reviewed Mr Cs account and had looked at information  from credit 
reference agencies  to decide  on a suitable  level of borrowing  it could offer him. He said 
NewDay had also given  Mr C the option  not to accept this increase. The investigator  didnt 
think NewDay should be required to refund  any charges to Mr C, or amend the record  on his 
credit file.
Mr C didnt accept the investigators findings  and asked for his complaint to be reviewed.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry  to hear about  the situation Mr C has found  himself in. I can appreciate  that this will 
have been a difficult time, and that his financial  circumstances will no doubt  have added to 
the worry he was feeling. 
I think its fair to say that the increase in his credit limit was a significant one for him, 
particularly as it was offered  a few months after hed taken  out the credit card with an agreed  
limit that he felt was manageable.
Ref: DRN60048952NewDay has told us that this limit was offered  after a full review of Mr Cs account and how 
he was managing his credit commitments  to make  sure it offers  lending  appropriately.  And 
after doing  this, it made the decision to offer Mr C the increase to his credit limit but he could 
let it know it he didnt  want it if he felt it wasnt going  to be manageable. 
So although  I can understand why Mr C may feel that NewDay  shouldve done more  when 
he paid off most of his balance but then built it back up again,  I dont think  it acted 
irresponsibly in offering him the increased  limit after reviewing his management of the 
account. Mr C had the option not to accept  it at the time it was offered, and he could also 
have asked NewDay to reduce his credit limit at any point if he felt this would help him to 
budget and manage his finances  in a way he felt more in control of.
NewDay has refunded  £40.51 in interest  and has suggested  ways that Mr C may look to 
manage the repayment of his balance. And I understand that Mr C has been able to make  
regular repayments  towards it, often  paying more than the minimum required amount. 
Overall, I dont  think NewDay  should  be required to refund any further interest  when this has 
been applied  to his balance in accordance  with the terms and conditions of the account.  
NewDay has an obligation to report accurate  and up-to date information to credit  reference 
agencies, and I think thats what its done  here. I can only suggest that Mr C contacts 
NewDay directly if he feels hes experiencing financial  hardship.  
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 October  2019.
