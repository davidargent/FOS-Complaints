Mr S complains that Western Circle Ltd (trading as Cashfloat) gave him loans that he 
couldnt afford to repay.

Mr S says Cashfloat should  never  have lent to him because he was in financial difficulties 
and couldnt afford to pay back what  he was borrowing.
Cashfloat said it gathered information about Mr S and his partners income, their self 
declared outgoings and also carried out credit checks to verify these amounts. Cashfloat 
says from the information  provided, the loans  were affordable for Mr S.
I issued a provisional decision in this complaint on 13 November 2018  partially  upholding   
Mr Ss complaint. Within  the decision I made the following findings:
The adjudicator thought Cashfloat  hadnt  carried out sufficient checks  on any of the 
loans, and if it had it would have seen that Mr S wouldnt have been able to afford them. 
But I was minded to reach a different outcome to that of our adjudicator.
I felt the checks Cashfloat  carried out for loans 1 and 2 were  proportionate and 
affordable for Mr S. But by the time Mr S asked to borrow  more money from loan 3 
onward, I concluded Cashfloat should have been asking  for further  information.  If it had 
done this for loans  3, 4 and 5 it would have seen that Mr S couldnt afford to repay them.
I then concluded that Cashfloat needed to put things right and pay compensation for 
what it did wrong with loan 3, 4 and 5. 
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Mr S confirmed on 24 November 2018 that he had nothing further to add.
The Cashfloat hasnt  responded  to my provisional decision. 
Ref: DRN32027832As Mr S has nothing further  to add and Cashfloat has not been  in contact with any additional  
points, I dont need to make  any further comments or depart from my findings. So I partially 
uphold Mr Ss complaint.
what the business should  do to put things right
I dont think Western Circle Ltd should have agreed to give Mr S loan 3, 4 and 5 that Im 
considering in this decision. So for these  3 loans, Western Circle Ltd should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to loan 3, 4 and 5.
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Ss credit  file in relation to these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Western Circle Ltd Limited to take off tax from this 
interest. Western Circle Limited must give Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken 
off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the above reasons, I uphold this complaint and direct Western Circle Limited  to pay     
Mr S fair compensation in accordance with the above calculation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 February  2019.
