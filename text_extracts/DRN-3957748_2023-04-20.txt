The complaint
Ms A complained that PayrNet Limited blocked and then closed her account and withheld 
access to her funds.
What happened
Ms A had an account with one of PayrNets electronic money agents. To keep things simple, 
Ill refer to PayrNet in this decision.
In January 2021, PayrNet restricted Ms As account. Ms A contacted PayrNet to find out 
what was happening, provided a copy of her identity document and proof of her address. In 
February PayrNet told Ms A that the account was still under review, and then in March asked 
Ms A for further information about a change of address and what she was using the card for.
Over the next few weeks, Ms A provided details of her address and her benefits payments, 
but PayrNet didnt remove the restrictions from the account. Dissatisfied, Ms A referred the 
matter to us. Then, in September 2021, PayrNet decided to close Ms As account and told 
her that the money would be returned to its source by bank transfer.
Our investigator looked at everything and thought the complaint should be upheld. She said 
that Ms A hadnt provided sufficient evidence to show she was entitled to a payment of £409 
into the account. But there was a remaining £171.94 which she thought PayrNet should pay 
to Ms A. She thought PayrNet should pay interest on this amount to compensate Ms A for 
the time shes been out of pocket. And she thought PayrNet should pay £100 for the trouble 
and upset this caused.
Ms A agreed with the investigator. PayrNet doesnt agree. It says that as it already paid all 
the funds back to source, this would mean it would pay these amounts twice.
As we couldnt resolve matters informally, the complaint has been referred to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Financial businesses like PayrNet are subject to a number of legal and regulatory 
requirements. These mean it needs to monitor transactions to and from its customers 
accounts and may need to review accounts at any time. When it does this it doesnt need to 
give reasons. And these legal and regulatory requirements also mean that PayrNet may 
need to restrict access to the account while it carries out its review.
Here, PayrNet reviewed Ms As account and asked Ms A for information about her identity 
and address. It restricted the account on 29 January 2021 and says that Ms A provided 
some information the same day. Then in March PayrNet told Ms A it needed further 
information. It appears Ms A had changed address, so what shed sent PayrNet didnt match 
the information it held on file. PayrNet also wanted information about what Ms A was using 
the account for. After some back and forth Ms A sent PayrNet screenshots of the payments 
into her account and screenshots from the UK government website showing universal credit 
payments. PayrNet completed its review, and in September 2021 told Ms A it had decided to 
close the account and return the payments to source.
Thinking about all of this I uphold the complaint.
PayrNet says it was acting in line with its legal and regulatory requirements when it reviewed 
Ms As account. But Id expect PayrNet to complete its review in a timely manner. And I 
would only expect it to return funds to source where it was satisfied that Ms A wasnt entitled 
to them.
PayrNet restricted Ms As account in January 2021. Yet it didnt tell Ms A it planned to close 
the account or return the funds to source until September 2021. Im satisfied that almost all 
of this delay was avoidable.
Ive next considered PayrNets decision to return the funds to source. Id only expect 
PayrNet to return these funds if it was satisfied Ms A wasnt entitled to them  and I note the 
terms and conditions that applied to the account also allowed the funds to be returned to the 
consumer if she could provide satisfactory proof of an alternative account.
Weve asked Ms A about these payments. Ms A says these payments came, respectively, 
from two close relatives, a close family friend, and from an online bingo site. Of this money, 
£409 appears to relate to a universal credit payment. PayrNet asked Ms A about that. Ms A 
says this was her benefit money but was paid into her sisters account. To evidence this, Ms 
A sent PayrNet screenshots. But PayrNet wasnt satisfied with the information Ms A 
provided, and so returned the funds to the sisters account. In the circumstances, I think this 
was fair.
But PayrNet doesnt appear to have asked specific questions about the remaining funds in 
the account. Ms A explained that, more generally, she received payments for hairdressing. 
But she told PayrNet she was unable to access her statements, which meant she couldnt 
provide further details about these specific transactions. And then after Ms A provided 
further information, on 22 April 2021, PayrNet doesnt appear to have acknowledged or 
asked Ms A any further questions before it completed its review. 
Thinking about all of this, Im not satisfied PayrNet has shown it had cause to return the 
remaining funds to their senders. Ive seen nothing to suggest Ms A wasnt entitled to the 
funds from the bingo site, and shes provided a plausible account of the purpose of the other 
funds. PayrNet didnt ask Ms A about these funds at the time. And Ms A doesnt appear to 
have recovered the funds subsequently. I acknowledge PayrNets concern that Ms A might 
now be able to get these funds back twice. But Ive found that PayrNet didnt have sufficient 
ground to return these funds to its source and I dont accept it would be fair for Ms A to lose 
out because of something PayrNet did wrong.
It appears Ms A relied on the £171.94 for essential spending. I find that Ms A suffered 
distress on account of not having access to these funds. I therefore also award £100 to 
reflect this.
Putting things right
PayrNet needs to put Ms A in the financial position shed be in if things had happened as 
they should have. PayrNet returned £171.94 which Ms A would otherwise have had the 
benefit of. PayrNet should now pay this to Ms A.PayrNet should also pay simple interest (the rate is 8% simple a year) on this amount from, 
12 March 2021, when PayrNet should reasonably have completed its investigation until Ms A 
gets the money back. HMRC requires PayrNet to deduct tax from this interest. PayrNet 
should send Ms A certificate setting out how it has worked this out should she need one.
Finally, I find this was distressing to Ms A. PayrNet should pay Ms A £100 to reflect the 
trouble and upset it caused.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint. PayrNet Limited should put things right by 
doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 May 2023.
