The complaint
Mr M says AXA France IARD mis-sold him a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy. 
What happened
Mr M bought the policy in 2001 after taking out a store card in 1995. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Mr M disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr Ms case.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ms complaint for the following reasons.
Mr M applied for the card in store in 1995. The PPI wasnt sold to him until 2001, when he 
took it over the phone. So, I think AXA made Mr M aware that he had a choice about buying 
the PPI, and that he chose to take it. 
AXA didnt recommend the PPI to Mr M so it didnt have to check if it was right for him. 
Its possible the information AXA gave Mr M about the PPI wasnt as clear as it shouldve 
been. But Mr M doesnt appear to have been affected by any of the main things the policy 
didnt cover  and based on what I know about his circumstances it looks like the policy 
couldve been useful to him. So, I dont think better information wouldve stopped him buying 
it. 
Ive taken into account Mr Ms comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 April 2020.
