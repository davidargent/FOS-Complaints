K820x#14complaint
This complaint is about a store card payment protection insurance  (PPI) policy  taken out in 
2000. Mrs L says AXA France  IARD  (AXA) mis-sold her PPI.
background
The background and circumstances leading  up to this complaint, which includes Mrs Ls 
circumstances at the time of the sale as well as the PPI policy  benefits,  limitations  and 
exclusions of cover, arent disputed.  So, I havent repeated all of this information here.
Our adjudicator did not uphold the complaint.
Mrs Ls representative disagreed with the adjudicators opinion   they didnt raise any new or 
additional points  but repeated the same  complaint points and arguments theyd previously 
made. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, I am required to take into account relevant: 
law and regulations;  regulators  rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, 
where appropriate, what I consider to have been  good industry practice  at the time.  
Weve set out our general approach to PPI mis-sale complaints on our website and 
published some  example  final decisions  that set out in detail how these relevant 
considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mrs Ls. I havent  set out that detailed information 
here but Ive taken  into account all relevant considerations in deciding Mrs Ls complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint and Ive summarised  my reasons 
for this conclusion below:
I think AXA made it clear that Mrs L didnt  have to take out the PPI and she chose to take 
it out. I say this because to get the cover, Mrs L had to sign her signature  for it. And that 
signature was separate to the signature  she had to make to get the credit. So, if Mrs L 
had only wanted  the credit  she could have left the PPI section blank. 
AXA told us the policy would have been sold without advice. Mrs L has provided no 
testimony about whether advice was given.  I have seen no evidence  of a detailed 
recommendation having been  made to Mrs L in this sale. So, considering all the 
submissions made  in this case, and in the absence of any detailed  testimony  from Mrs L 
to the contrary,  it seems most  likely that AXA didnt recommend  the PPI to Mrs L. So, it 
didnt have to check that the PPI was right or suitable for her. But it did have to give Mrs 
L enough clear and timely information so she could decide for herself it was right for her.
Ref: DRN18954142Its possible the information AXA gave Mrs L about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Ive found that she chose to take it out - so it looks like she wanted 
this type of cover. The cover wasnt fundamentally wrong  for Mrs L. Mrs L told us she 
had some sick pay she could have relied on but couldnt recall  the details. The PPI could 
have paid out in addition  to any sick pay Mrs L may have had and, most likely, for longer 
than her employer would have paid her at her full rate of pay. Mrs L told us she had 
some death in service  benefits  at work, but this wouldnt have helped  her if she was too 
ill to work, or lost her job. Mrs L told us she would have been entitled  to a payment in the 
event she was made redundant. But the policy would have reduced her reliance  on that 
payment in the event she lost her job. And Mrs L told us she had very little in the way of 
savings and no other insurance she could use to make her repayments in the event  of 
long-term ill health, or if she lost her job. Although  Mrs L says she had medical 
conditions some time before the policy  was taken out, I dont think  better  information  
about the existing medical  condition exclusion wouldve caused her to change her mind 
about taking out the policy. I say this because Mrs Ls hysterectomy occurred 18 years 
before the sale and whilst she told us it cost her some time off work  in 1982, there is no 
detailed testimony from Mrs L about  this and no suggestion that the condition  had 
caused her ongoing  issues or any time off work  in the intervening 18 years before the 
sale. And whilst  Mrs L told us her underactive thyroid was an issue  the year before the 
sale, it doesnt seem to have caused  her any time off at all at that time or subsequently. 
It also looks like the cover  was affordable  so it seems like it would have been useful for 
her if something went wrong. Because  of this I dont think  Mrs L would have declined  the 
cover had AXA done anything more.
While  the policy contained limitations and exclusions on claims relating to back and 
mental health conditions, in light of Mrs Ls circumstances at the time of sale and despite 
its limitations and exclusions, the policy wasnt fundamentally  wrong  or unsuitable  for 
her. So, I think she would have still thought she had some good  reasons to take the 
policy out.
Mrs L said she would have turned 60 while the policy was in force and so she would 
have not been eligible for the cover  from that time. However, Mrs L was 56 at the time of 
the sale and the policy would have  covered  Mrs L until the age of 65. So, there were 
many years of cover available to Mrs L under the policy.  So, I do not believe that better 
information about this would have  led her to avoid the policy.  
Overall, I consider that Mrs L would have still taken out PPI. The policy was sufficiently close  
to what its likely she thought she was getting  and I think  the policy could provide a useful 
benefit in a difficult time, given her circumstances at the time. And in those circumstances, I 
think that she would have taken out the policy in any event.
Mrs Ls representative has raised a number of what I consider to be general complaint 
points, which  it says apply  to all PPI complaints. These general  points  include:  a claim that 
the Financial Ombudsman Service is not correctly applying the regulators rules and 
guidance for handling PPI complaints; these policies represented poor value because  of the 
number of significant exclusions and limitations of cover coupled with the low claims ratio;  
and the duty of utmost good faith meant AXA should have disclosed the poor value and 
explained the significance of the limitations and exclusions  and the impact  it had on the 
chances of making  a claim.
But Mrs Ls representative has not said how these points apply to the specific facts and 
circumstances of Mrs Ls individual  complaint   just that they apply to all PPI complaints.
Ref: DRN18954143I have thought about these things and how they might apply in Mrs Ls particular case. But 
these points dont  persuade me to alter my conclusions about  what  is fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances  of the complaint  for the reasons Ive set out above I dont uphold this 
complaint. 
This means  AXA doesnt have to do anything to put things right.
my decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  Mrs Ls complaint  so I make no award.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs L to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 September 2021 .
