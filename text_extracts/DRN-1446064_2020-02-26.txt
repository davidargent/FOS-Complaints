The complaint
Mr R complains that Elevate Credit International (trading as Sunny.co.uk - Sunny) lent 
irresponsibly to him.  
What happened
Between June 2016 and August 2019, Mr R borrowed 42 loans from Sunny. The full extent 
of Mr Rs borrowing is set out in the appendix attached to this decision. For ease of 
reference, I have set out the first eight of those loans below:

Our adjudicator thought that Sunny should have undertaken further checks on Mr Rs 
financial circumstances at loan 5. He said if a proportionate check had been undertaken, 
Sunny would have known that Mr R was repaying multiple high cost short-term loans. By 
loan 6, our adjudicator said Sunny should have known the pattern of lending itself showed 
that the loan repayments were unsustainable. He thought the complaint should have been 
upheld in respect of loans 5 to 42. 
Sunny didnt agree with that view. For loan 5, it said that our adjudicator had not indicated 
what a proportionate check would have looked like. It provided information as to the nature 
of its loans and said that if a customer has more than four loans, their application will be 
automatically declined. It said that Mr R was not required to pay more than 6.36% of his 
monthly income on any one Sunny loan. As to the pattern of lending, it said that it was too 
early for our adjudicator to say that Mr R was dependent upon its loans by loan 6. However, 
it agreed that it should not have agreed to lend Mr R loans 18 to 42. It offered to settle the 
complaint on that basis. Mr R didnt accept Sunnys offer and so the matter has been passed to me to make a final 
decision. 
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
As I said above, I think early in the lending relationship, Sunny was entitled to rely on the 
information that Mr R provided to it. For loans 1-4, I can see that Sunny asked Mr R to 
provide his income and expenditure. And from the figures that were provided, I can see how 
Sunny reasonably concluded that the loan repayments were affordable. 
However, I agree with our adjudicator that by loan 5, Sunny should have started to ask more 
questions. This was the third loan Mr R had taken out in the space of six weeks and he had 
borrowed £550 in that time  which represents half of his monthly take home pay. Although Sunny said in response to our adjudicator that Mr R did not have to pay more than 6.36% of 
his monthly income, when the loan repayments were combined, Mr R was paying a 
considerably higher percentage than that. Altogether, his repayment obligations to Sunny 
would have been around £160 per month. 
It is my view that at that point, a proportionate check would have constituted a full review of 
Mr Rs financial circumstances. Had such a review been undertaken, Sunny would have 
seen that Mr R was heavily indebted to a number of short-term lenders. In fact, in the month 
before loan 5 was agreed, Mr Rs short-term lending repayments amounted to approximately 
£875. Almost all of his monthly income had gone on loan repayments.  It would have been 
abundantly clear to Sunny that Mr R could not sustainably afford to repay loan 5. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of the lending history with a view to seeing if there was 
a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. If that point was reached, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of this case, I agree with our adjudicator that this point 
was reached by loan 6 I say that because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr R was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. He had taken out six loans in around 9 months. Loans 5 and 6 were also 
taken out shortly after Mr R made his monthly repayments. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was most likely that Mr R was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
making those repayments was leaving in his finances. It should have known that Mr 
Rs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Rs first loan was for £150 and loan 6 was for the same amount.  At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that Mr R was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr R wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 42 was 
taken out over three years after the first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr R had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Mr R over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Mr R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time; 
and
the number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on his ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So Im also upholding the complaint about loan 5 and loans 6 to 42 and Sunny must take 
action to put things right.
 
Putting things right 
refund all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans 5 to 42;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;remove any negative information about loan 5 from Mr Rs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 to 42 should be removed from Mr 
Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr R 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
 My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partly upholding Mr Rs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International must comply with the above putting things right section. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 March 2020.
