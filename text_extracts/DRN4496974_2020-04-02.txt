In summary,  Mr E says he ran into financial difficulty as he took out several short-term loans 
just to get by. He told us this made his situation worse because  of the large  amounts of 
added interest. He didnt think Sunny carried out the necessary checks. If they had they 
would have realised  he couldnt afford to take them  out.
In its final response letter  to Mr E, Sunny said it did not accept Mr Es loans were  
unaffordable and it did not uphold his complaint.
Ref: DRN44969742Initially our adjudicator upheld Mr Es complaint  and thought the loans from 5-25 shouldnt 
have been given to Mr E. 
Another adjudicator  reviewed the matter. This time he said he still upheld the matter from 
loan 5 but not until loan 13 did Mr Es overall  pattern  of lending  suggest hed had become 
persistently reliant  on short-term loans. Sunny said it would uphold Mr Es complaint from 
loan 19 onwards. It offered to put things right and give Mr E a total of £562.61  and remove  
loans 19 onwards from Mr Es credit  file. Mr E did not accept this offer, so the complaint was 
passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr E could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr E could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
Ref: DRN44969743to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Es complaint. Ive decided to uphold this complaint  
from loan 5 onwards.  I will explain why.
Our adjudicator said he thought the complaint  about  loans 1-4 shouldnt be upheld and as 
neither party  seems to be in dispute  about  this, I have not considered  these loans further.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 5-12 would most likely have 
shown that Mr E was having problems managing his money and he couldnt sustainably  
afford to repay these  loans. When Mr E took out loan 5, he still had loans 3 and 4 
outstanding. As well as the two loan repayments outstanding it also appears,  he had another 
outstanding loan with another business. In addition, taking into account  the income Mr E had 
declared and his expenditure, the loan repayments  left him with a negative amount of money 
with which  he probably needed to repay the outstanding loans and any unforeseen 
expenses. So, by this time it should  have been  clear to Sunny that Mr E was not going to be 
able to sustainably  pay this loan repayments  or any subsequent loans.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr E, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Es case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
13. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr E was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. By the time Mr E had taken out loan 13 hed had a lending  relationship  
with Sunny for just over seven months and Mr E had been  indebted to Sunny for 
most of that time save for a few gaps in between. So Sunny ought  to have realised it 
was more likely than not Mr E was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loans were leaving in his finances and that Mr Es 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Es first loan was for £400.00 and loan 13 was for £700.00.  So, it doesnt seem  
likely that Mr Es need for cash was reducing  which also points to him having a 
longer term need for funds. So, at this point Sunny ought  to have known that Mr E 
was not likely borrowing  to meet a temporary  shortfall in their income  but to meet  an 
ongoing need. 
From  loan 13 onwards  Mr E was provided  with a new loan within  days or weeks  of 
settling a previous  one. 
Mr E wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 25 was 
taken out 18 months after Mr Es first. And it was for £650.00 which was a larger 
amount. Mr E had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny 
over an extended period.
I think that Mr E lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 13 
onwards because:
Ref: DRN44969744these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Es indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr E borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Es ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5-12 and loans 13-25 and Sunny should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr E paid on loans 5-25;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5-12 from Mr Es credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 13 onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  13-25  should be removed from Mr Es 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr E a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Es complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 May 2020.
