The complaint
Mr B and Ms H complain that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) recorded adverse 
information on Ms Hs credit file.
What happened
Ms H set a loan payment plan which she was told would not be reported to the Credit 
Reference Agencies (CRAs). She later found out, when trying to buy something, that 
NatWest had reported the arrangement to the CRAs. Ms H says NatWest agreed to remove 
the information but didnt do so. She says the compensation offer doesnt go far enough and 
says this mistake could have had more significant consequences if, for example, she had 
tried to take out a mortgage.
NatWest accepts making mistakes and accepts it didnt update the CRAs correctly in 
November 2020. It has paid a total of Â£305.69 compensation and has now asked the CRAs 
to remove the information from Ms Hs credit file.
Mr B and Ms H brought the complaint to us and our investigator thought that NatWest had 
paid an appropriate amount of compensation and correctly updated the credit file.
Mr B and Ms H dont accept that view and say Ms H was caused embarrassment in the store 
when the mistake came to light.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that NatWest has dealt fairly with this 
complaint. I appreciate Mr B and Ms H will be disappointed with my decision.
There is no question here that NatWest made a mistake and incorrectly reported the loan 
agreement to the CRAs. I have no doubt Ms H was caused embarrassment in the shop 
when the mistake came to light and I accept she has been caused distress and 
inconvenience. I also accept that NatWest ought to have been able to sort out the mistake 
far sooner than it did. But Im satisfied that NatWest has fairly apologised for what took place 
and given Ms H an explanation.
The key issue is the level of compensation. I dont think Ms H suffered any real financial loss 
as a result of NatWests mistake and I cant take into account what may have happened. I 
appreciate Ms H says she could have been applying for a mortgage, but I have to consider 
what did take place. Having done so I think NatWest has now updated Ms Hs credit file and 
paid what I think is a fair and reasonable compensation award by writing off part of the loan 
and paying compensation.
Overall, I accept NatWest made mistakes but I find its total compensation award fair and 
reasonable and so I cant fairly order it to increase that award.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B and Ms H to 
accept or reject my decision before 15 April 2021.
