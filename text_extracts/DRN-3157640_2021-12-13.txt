The complaint
 Mr Q complains PayrNet Limited blocked his Pockit account and withheld money from him. 
Mr Q says this caused severe stress and anxiety and hed like compensation.
The underlying card and account services of Pockit accounts were migrated over to PayrNet 
Limited on 27 November 2020. 
What happened
In December 2020, Mr Q raised a fraud claim with PayrNet and they decided to block his 
account to review things. During this time, Mr Q couldnt access his account  or the money 
in it.
At the beginning of January 2021, Mr Q received a benefit payment into his account but as 
his account remain blocked, he couldnt access it. Mr Q said he needed this money for his 
rent and being without it caused him severe stress and anxiety. 
Mr Q spent time trying to get in touch with PayrNet about access to his money. He received 
a notification in February 2021 which confirmed his account was under review until further 
notice. Mr Q said the overall situation resulted in him losing his home.
PayrNet finalised their review in August 2021. They made the decision to close Mr Qs 
account and returned the money in it, including Mr Qs benefit money, back to the original 
source. Mr Q was able to retrieve this money from the sender of the benefit money directly 
but was unhappy with the time PayrNet took to deal with things and the impact it had on him. 
Mr Q brought the complaint to our service.
Our investigator upheld Mr Qs complaint. He was satisfied PayrNet could review, and close, 
Mr Qs account. But, based on the limited information PayrNet had provided, he didnt think 
theyd treated Mr Q fairly with the time the review took and thought they could have returned 
the money directly to Mr Q  instead of back to the original source. Our investigator 
recommended PayrNet pay Mr Q interest on the money they could have returned to him 
directly, and £200 compensation for the distress and inconvenience.
PayrNet didnt agree. They said the complaint should be set up against a different business 
because the date of the event happened before the previous business migrated over to 
PayrNet. Our investigator explained the event Mr Q is complaining about started in 
December 2020 which is after the migration  and therefore, PayrNet are responsible. 
PayrNet didnt respond so the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 The account review, block and closure
Firstly, like our investigator has explained, PayrNet has important legal and regulatory 
obligations they must meet when providing accounts to customers. And they must take 
certain actions to meet these obligations. 
PayrNet are required to regularly review the relationships they hold with their customers. 
And its often appropriate for them to restrict customers accounts either in full or partially 
while they carry out their review.
Mr Q raised a fraud claim, so Im satisfied PayrNets decision to review the account was fair. 
But Id expect them to carry out the review in a timely manner  and I cant reasonably say 
they did that. PayrNet didnt complete their review until August 2021. In order for me to be 
satisfied that PayrNets actions were appropriate in the circumstances, Id need to see 
evidence of what actions they took during the review. PayrNet hasnt shared that level of 
detail with our service, despite our investigators attempts to get further information from 
them, so I cant confidently say their actions were reasonable. 
Following their review, PayrNet decided to end their relationship with Mr Q. Banks 
sometimes choose to end their relationship with customers. This can be due to a number of 
reasons, and a bank isnt obliged to give a reason to the customer  only to meet the 
account closure terms and conditions. Just the same as if Mr Q decided to stop banking with 
PayrNet, he wouldnt have to explain why. PayrNet can only close accounts in certain 
circumstances and in line with the terms and conditions of the account. PayrNet have relied 
on and complied with the terms and conditions when closing Mr Qs account and I do not 
think they acted unfairly and unreasonably. 
Access to the benefit money
While Im satisfied PayrNet were entitled to review Mr Qs account, its usually reasonable 
that a customer still has access to their benefit money. Mr Q made PayrNet aware of his 
financial difficulties, but I havent seen that PayrNet acknowledged he may be in a vulnerable 
position. Based on everything Ive seen, I think Mr Q should have been given access to the 
benefit money on the same day it credited his account. He didnt  and therefore, I dont 
agree PayrNet acted fairly.
The impact on Mr Q
I appreciate the impact this overall situation had on Mr Q. He said he needed his benefit 
money for rent which was due  and he ended up losing his home. Ive considered this point 
carefully, and like our investigator, I cant fairly hold PayrNet responsible for Mr Q losing his 
home. I say that because it appears Mr Q was already in rent arrears before PayrNet 
withheld the benefit money in question. So even if they had given him access to it when they 
should have  I dont think it would have made an overall difference to Mr Qs situation.
I do however recognise the distress the situation had on him. Mr Q has described how the 
stress and anxiety resulted in him drinking a lot more  I have no reason to disbelieve Mr Q 
on this point and can understand why he would have found the situation stressful. I therefore 
think PayrNet should pay Mr Q compensation to recognise this.
Putting things right
 PayrNet should recognise the time Mr Q was without his benefit money and pay 8% simple 
interest to recognise his loss of use of the money. They should also pay £200 compensation 
for the distress and inconvenience caused by the overall delays. 
My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold Mr Qs complaint against PayrNet limited. To put things right, PayrNet Limited should:
Pay interest at 8% simple per year on the benefit money Mr Q should have had 
access to from 4 January 2021 until the date of the funds being released back to 
source.
HM Revenue & Customs require PayrNet Limited to withhold income tax from the 
above-mentioned interest. PayrNet should give Mr Q a certificate showing how much 
is taken off if Mr Q asks for one.
Pay Mr Q £200 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Q to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 January 2022.
