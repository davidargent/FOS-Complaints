The complaint
Mr A complains that he was mis-sold a Select Account (SA) by Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) 
some time before September 2001.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions of the adjudicator for these reasons:
Mr A had previously had a fee free account, so he knew these were available. I think its 
more likely than not that Mr A received account statements which showed the account fee 
each month, so he was aware he was paying a monthly fee for it. So, I think Mr A knew he 
had a choice whether to take out the SA and he chose to do so.
At the time of the sale Mr A had a car, and from the first available statements on file in 
September 2001, he regularly used the overdraft on his account. Lloyds has provided 
evidence that Mr A used the car breakdown and overdraft benefits on multiple occasions. 
So, I dont think its more likely than not that the SA was unsuitable for him or that he didnt 
have enough information about it.
So, in my view, I cant say that Lloyds did anything wrong.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 March 2021.
