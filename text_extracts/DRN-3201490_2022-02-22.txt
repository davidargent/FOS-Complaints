The complaint
Mr G has complained National Westminster Bank Plc managed his fraud claim poorly.
What happened
In May 2020 Mr G saw a number of transactions on his credit card account that hed not 
made. These were mostly to retailers for products with a trial period or a similar nature. 
NatWest refunded the transactions and confirmed theyd send a form for Mr G to sign and 
return. They also raised the transactions with the merchants. Some of these disputed Mr Gs 
stance.
Two further fraudulent transactions were carried out which Mr G disputed with NatWest. 
Although Mr G was initially refunded, NatWest subsequently re-debited his account. Mr G 
had never received any form to fill out and was concerned NatWest had taken no action to 
limit the affect of fraudulent activity on his account.
Despite earlier attempts to sort things out with NatWest, Mr G felt he had no alternative but 
to engage solicitors to help him. His solicitors then spent more than four hours trying to 
resolve issues with NatWest. 
NatWest paid Mr G £125 in compensation for the trouble caused along with £10 for his travel 
costs. They also refunded money for two disputed transactions on a current account Mr G 
held jointly.
Mr G remained unhappy with the service hed got and NatWests ability to manage fraud on 
his account. He brought his complaint to our service and was looking for NatWest to settle 
his legal costs.
Our investigator understood the frustration Mr G must have felt with what had happened but 
didnt believe it would be fair to ask NatWest to do anything further.
Mr G remained unhappy and asked an ombudsman to consider his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached a slightly different outcome to our investigator. Ive explained 
this already to NatWest and explain below my reasoning.
Theres no dispute Mr G was a victim of fraud. Unfortunately NatWest is unable to assist in 
helping Mr G understand how this happened. I suspect its something as simple as his card 
details being obtained fraudulently and used by dodgy retailers. Some of the disputed 
transactions were for retailers which offer free trials and make it difficult for these to be 
cancelled.
It took until September 2021 until the final £1.25 was refunded but all the money from the 
fraudulent transactions has now been fully refunded.  
Our investigator rightly explained that she cant criticise NatWest for having certain 
procedures in place to manage fraud claims. However I can see how irritating  and 
unexplained  it must be when two lots of forms sent to Mr G are never received in the post. 
Mr G does receive some correspondence on this issue from NatWest by email so I also 
wonder why it wouldnt have been much easier for them to just email him.
I also appreciate the issues that arose when Mr Gs solicitors tried to resolve issues by 
phone. Four hours during which there was a large amount of time spent hanging on and a 
mix-up with another customer doesnt sound great. Itll be no surprise to Mr G that banks are 
on occasion criticised for the service they provide when customers report and try to get 
resolved their fraud claims. However its not my role to tell banks what systems they need to 
put in place to manage their customer relationships.
That said I can look at the impact their existing operations have on the individual customer 
whos brought a complaint to our service. I cover this aspect below under putting things right.
Mr G has asked us to get NatWest to refund his legal costs. I appreciate Mr G was worried 
about what was happening with his account and concerned that NatWest wasnt dealing with 
this properly. He didnt ask his solicitor to get involved until after he got the first final 
response from NatWest so it could be argued that he had tried to deal with it himself but had 
found this hadnt worked.
However our service doesnt generally refund legal costs unless there are specific reasons 
that these have arisen. In this case, Mr G had already been refunded practically in full by 
NatWest so his issue wasnt about ensuring the refunds but about getting answers to 
questions he felt were outstanding. Overall I dont think it would be fair to ask NatWest to 
refund Mr Gs legal costs of £1,000 when there was so little actual loss outstanding.
Putting things right
NatWest paid Mr G £125 (firstly £75 and then a further £50) in compensation in September 
2020. I dont believe this takes into account Mr Gs personal circumstances  his age, depth 
of feeling about what had happened, promises of forms being sent but never received  
sufficiently. Ive told NatWest I believe a further £100 should be paid to Mr G to 
compensation him fairly. Theyve not provided any further comment.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is to instruct National Westminster Bank Plc to 
pay Mr G £100 for the trouble caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 March 2022.
