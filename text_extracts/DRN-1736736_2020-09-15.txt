The complaint
Mr S complains about the amount that hes been charged by PSA Finance UK Limited, 
trading as Autobank Financial Services, for damage to a car that had been supplied to him 
under a conditional sale agreement. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr S under a conditional sale agreement with PSA 
Finance that he signed in October 2016  he voluntarily terminated the agreement 
and returned the car in September 2019;
the car was inspected by a third party on behalf of PSA Finance in November 2019 
and the inspection report identified damage to the car with a total value of £1,336.08 
 the report included photos of the damage and recorded the cars mileage as 41,349 
so it had been driven for about 27,000 miles since it was supplied to Mr S;
PSA Finance charged Mr S for the damage but then agreed to reduce the charges by 
£150 and to reduce them by a further £100 because of its delay in telling him about 
the charges;
Mr S had agreed in the terms and conditions that he accepted when he signed the 
agreement that he would keep the car in a good condition, carry out any repairs and 
replace parts when necessary and that he would pay PSA Finance compensation if 
he didnt do so;
our investigator recommended that PSA Finance should reduce the total charge by a 
further £32 because he didnt think that it was fair or reasonable for Mr S to be 
charged the full amount for the chipped bumper or to charge him for the poorly 
patched paintwork  and it has agreed to do so  but Mr S says that theres no proof 
that the photos are of his car and that there are many discrepancies in the report;
the photos in the report match the description of the car, the registration number is 
the same and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
photos in the car arent of the car that was supplied to Mr S;
those photos show damage to the car and I consider it to be more likely than not that 
the damage was present when the car was returned by Mr S when he voluntarily 
terminated his agreement  Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that the car was damaged after it was returned by Mr S but before it was inspected; 
other than one of the chips to the bumper and the paintwork on the left front door, I 
dont consider that the damage would reasonably be regarded to be fair wear and 
tear in accordance with the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association guide on 
fair wear and tear  so I consider that its fair and reasonable for PSA Finance to 
charge Mr S for the damage; and
PSA Finance has accepted that there was a delay in Mr S being charged for the 
damage and it has reduced the charges by £100 because of that delay  its also 
reduced the charges by £150 and has now agreed to reduce the charges by a further 
£32 to £1,054.08  and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require it to reduce the total charge any further. 
Putting things right
I find that PSA Finance should reduce the amount that its charged Mr S for the damage to 
the car that he returned by a further £32 to £1,054.08  but Im not persuaded that it would 
be fair or reasonable for me to require it to reduce the total charge any further or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ss complaint in part and I order PSA Finance UK Limited, 
trading as Autobank Financial Services, to reduce the total charge that its made to Mr S by 
£32 to £1,054.08.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2020.
