K821x#15complaint
V is a limited  company. It complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA closed its account 
and withheld  its funds.
background
V sells goods online. It had a PayPal account, through  which  it received payments from its 
customers.
PayPal decided to close Vs account  in February  2019. It blocked access to the account 
funds, of around £7,000. In June 2019,  it used some of these funds to settle a separate  
working capital credit  facility held by V. It released the remaining balance of around £3,200  
in October 2019.
V says PayPals decision to close the account  was unfair. It believes the decision related to 
some of the products it sells  but says it was always open about  these  with PayPal, and 
had been approved for such sales just six months prior to the account  closure.  
PayPal says the account was closed after a review of Vs account  activity showed it to be in 
breach of its Acceptable Use policy. It says the closure, the settlement  of the credit facility 
and the hold on funds were all carried out in line with the terms of its User Agreement. And 
on the latter, it says funds were held due to the risk of payment  reversals (where  funds  
would be returned  to the sender).
Our investigator explained that the rules about  who can use our service meant we could  only 
consider Vs complaint  about things that had happened on or after 1 April 2019. So he didnt  
think we could look at PayPals decision to close the account. But he thought  we could  look 
at what PayPal had done with Vs funds. 
On that issue, our investigator thought  that PayPal had been  entitled to settle the credit 
facility with the funds held on account. But he couldnt see why it had needed to hold on to 
the remaining  funds  for so long. He said that payment reversals had to be submitted within 
180 days  but PayPal had kept the funds  for much  longer. With no explanation as to why, 
he didnt think that was reasonable. So he thought PayPal  should pay 8% interest  on the 
funds for the additional time that V had been without  them,  along  with £150 compensation 
for the inconvenience  of having to chase things up.
V accepted  our investigators view, but PayPal didnt. It maintained that its actions  had been  
in line with the terms of the account.  So the matter was passed  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The decision  to close Vs account
Firstly I should confirm  our investigators view that due to the limits of our jurisdiction, we 
cant investigate Vs concerns about  PayPals decision  to close its account.
Ref: DRN18986142PayPal closed Vs account in February  2019.  To be eligible to refer its complaint about this 
to our service, V would  need  to meet  the definition of a micro-enterprise under our rules.  
And to do so, it would  need to employ fewer than 10 people. 
As V has exceeded  this threshold over the last couple of years, it doesnt qualify as a micro-
enterprise. So we cant look at concerns relating  to anything  that happened  prior to 
1 April 2019.
Our rules changed on 1 April 2019,  allowing us to consider  complaints  from business 
customers who meet the definition of a small business. Im satisfied that V does. But the 
rules arent retrospective  so we can only look into things that happened on or after 
1 April 2019.
This means  that while  we cant look at PayPals decision to close  the account,  we can 
consider PayPals use and retention of the account funds from 1 April 2019 onwards.
The use and retention of Vs funds
When V first referred its complaint to us, it was concerned that without access to its PayPal 
account, it was unable to make  the payments needed to service its separate  working capital 
facility. It wanted PayPal to use the account  balance to settle the facility. PayPal did this  
repaying the facility  with some of the funds held on account and closing  it down. Such action 
was allowed for under  the terms and conditions  of the facility. And as it seems  that was in 
accordance with Vs wishes,  I cant see that it did anything wrong here.
Recognising the limits  of what we can and cant consider within  this complaint, I understand 
that Vs main concern  now is with how long it took PayPal to release the remaining  account  
balance. The account was closed on 25 February 2019, with the funds  released  on 
8 October  meaning  V was without the funds  for around 225 days in all. So Ive thought 
about whether  this was reasonable.
PayPals terms and conditions allowed  it to retain  funds in these  circumstances, for so long 
as reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability. This included for more  than 
180 days if so required  by PayPal.  So while  retention  of the funds was allowed for under 
the terms of the account, those terms also explained  that this was only where PayPal had a 
need or requirement to do so.
I can see the need for PayPal to have retained  funds for a certain period of time, in order  to 
cover any payment reversals that Vs customers might seek to make (for example, through a 
chargeback). And thats a specific  reason  given  in its conditions. But I think  180 days  would 
be sufficient to protect against  such risk  bearing  in mind that in general,  chargebacks  have 
to be raised within  120 days of the transaction at issue. 
Here, PayPal held Vs funds for significantly longer than 180 days. Weve asked it to explain 
why, but its declined to give a reason. Within  its final response letter of 4 June 2019, it 
explained to V that it would need to see valid ID before releasing the funds. But I understand 
from V that this was provided immediately  and PayPals not said anything  to the contrary.  
So while I accept that the terms and conditions  allowed PayPal to hold funds for more than 
180 days if required,  I cant see that it actually had a need to do so here. So retaining  the 
funds for as long as it did was unreasonable. I think it ought to have returned them to V after 
180 days.
Ref: DRN18986143Ive gone on to consider whether V has lost out as a result  of PayPals actions. Weve asked 
V if it incurred any costs or losses in being  without  the funds for longer than was necessary, 
but its declined  to share any details of those with us. So with no direct financial losses to 
consider, I think it would be fair for PayPal  to compensate V for being deprived of the funds 
for the additional  45 days  which it should do by paying 8% simple  interest  for this period.
I appreciate that being without the funds wouldve put V to some  trouble, both in adjusting its 
working capital arrangements and in pursuing  the matter with PayPal  and then us  until 
the funds were released. So I also think  PayPal should compensate V for this 
inconvenience, and agree that £150  is fair in the circumstances.
my final decision
I uphold Vs complaint and require PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
Pay V 45 days interest on the closing balance, calculated at 8% simple per year;  and
Pay V compensation of £150.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask V to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 July 2020.
