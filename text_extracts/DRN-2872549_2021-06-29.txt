The complaint
Mrs F brings this complaint on behalf of H (a company) in her capacity as director. H 
complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) cancelled a debit card on its bank 
account causing it trading difficulties. 
What happened
Mrs F says she informed NatWest she had entered into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement 
(IVA). Mrs F says as a result NatWest cancelled the company debit card she held, which has 
caused the business trading problems as they were unable to source materials and pay bills 
and as a result couldnt perform treatments for its clients, resulting in a loss of revenues. Mrs 
F says NatWest should reissue the debit card and offer compensation for the lack of 
earnings and inconvenience caused. 
NatWest says the debit card was cancelled as it was linked to Mrs Fs personal facilities with 
them and they are unable to reissue a card in her name for the business. NatWest says a 
named official of H was given access to a debit card for the business. NatWest feel they 
have acted correctly.
Mrs F wasnt happy with NatWests response and referred the matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information and upheld the complaint as he felt 
Mrs Fs personal situation shouldnt impact on the companys banking arrangements. The 
investigator felt NatWests actions had made it more difficult for H to pay for its products and 
services. While the investigator couldnt tell NatWest to change its systems and processes, 
he felt it should pay £100 in compensation for the inconvenience it has caused. 
NatWest maintained they hadnt made any mistakes here but agreed to pay the 
compensation to H to close the matter. Mrs F didnt agree with the level of compensation 
awarded and asked for the matter to be referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator, for much the same 
reasons, and I will explain how I have come to my decision.
I can understand the removal of access to Hs company debit card would have been 
inconvenient for the running of Mrs Fs business, given her own personal financial 
circumstances at the time and the backdrop of the Covid pandemic. 
When looking at this complaint I will consider if NatWest have acted reasonably, when 
cancelling Mrs Fs card on Hs bank account and if the compensation recommended by the 
investigator is sufficient here. 
What happened here is Mrs F a director of H, informed NatWest she had entered into an IVA 
and part of their process following this, was to cancel any debit cards connected to her bank 
profile, unfortunately this included her debit card on Hs business bank account. 
NatWest have told Mrs F and this service, this is part of their systems and processes, and it 
cant now reissue another card in her name for the business. Mrs F says NatWests actions 
here, resulted in the business not being able to purchase goods, advertise or conduct its 
normal business activities and as a result, it lost considerable revenue. 
While I can see the business would have been inconvenienced by the cancellation of the 
debit card, I cant say with any certainty that, this was the main contributing factor to the loss 
of business income, as Mrs F claims. I say this because the business always had other 
means at its disposal at this time to make payments, such as online banking and a cheque 
book. NatWest did agree to, and arrange for, another official of the company to gain access 
to a debit card, a few weeks later too. 
Its important to say that NatWest is entitled to decide on its policies and procedures in 
situations like this. But my role is to look at all of the circumstances of an individual dispute 
and reach a decision on whats fair and reasonable. Here, I think that NatWest was entitled 
to follow its policy as it did. This clearly had an impact on H  especially given that this took 
place during the Covid pandemic, which had an impact on customers and businesses alike. 
But I also have to consider that this was only one way of H being able to carry out the 
services that a debit card is intended for.
Having said that, I do think that NatWest could have been more proactive in helping Mrs F 
understand what alternative payment methods H could have put in place, to reduce the 
inconvenience caused by not having access to the business debit card. I say this as 
NatWest have accepted there were no issues with the business, but their systems simply 
couldnt issue a new card to Mrs F. 
While Mrs F may not agree, like the investigator I agree a modest compensation to 
recognise the impact of this on H is a reasonable outcome here and NatWest have agreed to 
this.
While H will be disappointed with my decision, I feel the level of compensation offered by the 
investigator is fair for the reasons I have already given.  
Putting things right
I instruct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay H £100 by way of compensation.
My final decisionMy final decision is that I uphold this complaint.
I instruct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay H £100 by way of compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask H to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2021.
