K820x#14complaint
Mrs S says Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds)  mis-sold  her a payment protection insurance (PPI)  
policy. 
background and summary to complaint
Mrs S took the policy out to cover  the payments on a credit card. Due to the time that has 
passed, its not clear  how Mrs S applied for her credit card and PPI policy. The credit card 
was opened in 1993 and Lloyds has treated the start date of the PPI as 1993 as well. The 
earliest credit card statements available are from January 2000  which  do show  the PPI 
premiums being collected.  
Between 1993 and 2000, Mrs S was employed  as a teacher. She has told us she was 
entitled to some sick pay and death  in service benefit through her employer. But she didnt 
have any other means of repaying her credit card should she be unable to work.  Mrs S has 
said she was in good health  at the time of the sale. But we are aware that she had 
undergone two medical procedures some time before 1993. 
As there is such little information available from the time of sale, Ive looked at a range of 
policies available  from 1993 to 2000, as well as considered what I know more generally 
about how these  policies were sold and worked. I have then used that to help me complete 
my assessment of this case.  
The policy likely provided cover for accident, sickness,  and unemployment   subject to its 
exclusions and limitations. It offered to repay  10% of Mrs Ss credit card balance  in the event 
of a successful claim. At the time,  it cost no more  than 79p per Â£100 of the monthly  
outstanding balance. The premium would continue to have to be paid during a successful 
claim and it did attract  interest.  
Lloyds has sent us screenshots to show that the credit card account closed in 2005.  
Mrs Ss representative has made  lengthy and substantial representations  on her behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have  read and considered  them all carefully. In 
summary, Mrs Ss representative says:
Lloyds failed to meet the sales standards which applied at the time.  In those 
circumstances, applying  the regulators rules and guidance for businesses  on 
handling PPI complaints  under  DISP  App 3, it should be presumed Mrs S wouldnt 
have taken out the policy and the complaint should be upheld.  Mrs Ss 
representatives believe there to be no evidence to rebut that presumption;
The policy excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress,  which  are some  of the 
most common reasons people  are off work. This significantly reduced  the value of 
cover;
The true costs including interest  and the fact it was unlikely you could make  a 
successful claim  meant the policy was of inherently poor value as shown by the low 
claims ratio. The common law duty of utmost good  faith means Lloyds should have 
told Mrs S about the poor value; 
Ref: DRN56356032The common law duty of utmost good faith also means Lloyds should have explained 
the significance  of the exclusions  and limitations of cover  to Mrs S and the impact  
they would  have had on her chances  of making  a claim; and 
The information Mrs S received was misleading.  These policies were promoted  as 
providing peace of mind, but the number of exclusions and limitations on the scope of 
the cover  meant this was untrue.
Our adjudicator did not uphold the complaint   both parties have seen and provided their 
responses to the adjudicators opinion. Mrs S disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  for 
several reasons.  
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
relevant considerations
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, I am required to take into account: relevant 
law and regulations;  relevant  regulators  rules,  guidance and standards; relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published  some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mrs Ss. I dont intend to set that out in 
much detail here but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Ss complaint.
This sale took place  in between 1993  and 2000  before the General Insurance  Standards 
Council (GISC)  published its code of practice  in June 2000 and before the sale of general 
insurance products  like this became regulated in January 2005. So, the GISC  Code, the 
FSAs (and FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses and insurance  conduct rules 
(ICOB and ICOBs)  arent applicable to this complaint, nor is the FCAs Perimeter  Guidance 
(PERG). 
The credit agreement itself concluded  in 2005. That means the unfair relationship  provisions 
set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme Court judgment in Plevin  about  
s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance made by the FCA about the handling  of 
complaints about  the non-disclosure of commission  in light of the Plevin  judgment,  arent 
applicable. 
There were a number of industry codes in existence  at that time, which I am satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. In particular,  The Association of British Insurers  General Insurance Business 
Code of Practice for all intermediaries  (Including  Employees of Insurance Companies) other  
than Registered Insurance Brokers  The ABI Code. 
The ABI Code was supplemented by:
Ref: DRN56356033Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement  of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries  
I consider these publications to be indicative of the standards of good practice expected  of 
intermediaries like Lloyds  at the time. So Im satisfied I should take the ABI Code and these 
other publications into account  when  deciding, what is in my opinion,  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of Mrs Ss case.  
 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including:  the law relating to 
negligence, misrepresentation and contract  (including the express  and implied duty on 
professional advisers  to give advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence); the law 
relating to the duty of utmost good faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness.  
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001,  Im also required  to take into account  what 
determination the relevant former  scheme   in this case the Office of the Banking  
Ombudsman  might have been expected  to reach  in relation to an equivalent complaint. I 
note that under the Banking  Ombudsmans terms of reference the Ombudsman  was 
required to decide  complaints by reference  to what was, in his opinion,  fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances   and that the Ombudsman was required to observe any applicable 
rule of law or relevant judicial authority. 
I am also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first 
issued by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating to the 
sale of PPI. This sale took place before insurance mediation became a regulated  activity,  so 
Lloyds was required to take into account the provisions in DISP  App 3 as if they were 
guidance when  considering Mrs Ss complaint. 
key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account,  it seems to me that the key questions I need  
to consider in deciding  what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of 
this complaint, are:
-If Lloyds gave advice,  whether  it advised Mrs S with reasonable care and skill  in 
particular, whether the policy  was appropriate  or suitable for her, given her needs 
and circumstances.  
-Whether Lloyds gave Mrs S sufficient,  appropriate and timely information to enable 
her to make an informed choice about  whether to take out the policy,  including  
drawing to her attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading  way  
the main provisions of the policy and significant  limitations and exclusions.  
-If, having considered  these questions,  I determine the complaint in favour of Mrs S, I 
must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Mrs S suffered loss or 
damage and what  I consider would amount to fair compensation for that loss or 
damage. 
Ref: DRN56356034Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Mrs S and 
Lloyds, Ive decided  not to uphold  Mrs Ss complaint. Ive set out my reasoning below. 
did Mrs S know  she had a choice?
Lloyds had to make it clear that the PPI policy was optional. 
As explained above, its not clear how or when Mrs S took out her PPI. Lloyds records dont 
show how or when  it was added to her credit card account  and Mrs S also hasnt said how 
she believes  she applied for it. As there is such limited evidence  available, Ive had to decide 
what I think is more likely  based on the available evidence. 
The earliest credit card statements Lloyds has is from January 2000  and this shows PPI 
being charged  so I think its likely  it was added  sometime before then. 
Lloyds has assumed that the PPI was taken out at the same  time as the credit card in 1993. 
Lloyds has also assumed it was a branch  sale. It has provided a sample credit card 
application form from around that time to show how the PPI would be presented  in a paper 
application form  and this shows customers had to select PPI on their form before it was 
added to their accounts. 
 
We have seen a number of cases from 1993 through to 2000 and developed a good 
understanding of Lloyds  usual processes when it sold PPI. And Lloyds usually made it clear 
that the PPI was optional and it sought its customers consent  before it was added to their 
accounts. I havent seen anything to make me doubt that Lloyds followed its normal  process 
in this case. 
Taking everything into account,  I think its more likely that Mrs S knew the policy  was 
optional and she agreed to take it out without undue  pressure. 
did Lloyds provide  advice?
Neither Lloyds nor Mrs S know  whether advice  was provided in this case.  Lloyds has treated 
this case as an advised sale as this holds  it to a higher standard.  This means  Lloyds had to 
advise Mrs S with reasonable care and skill, in particular  whether the policy was appropriate 
or suitable given  her needs  and circumstances. So, Ive done  the same, and assessed this 
case as an advised  sale. 
the advice
For the reasons  explained above, I dont  know  what steps Lloyds  took to establish  whether 
the policy was a suitable recommendation  for Mrs S. It seems  Mrs S cant remember clearly  
what happened and there is no record of what the adviser discussed in relation to the policy. 
The adviser likely had some limited information  about Mrs Ss financial circumstances, but 
there is no specific evidence to show the adviser  took steps to establish  whether Mrs S 
would have been caught by the significant  exclusions and limitations  which might have 
meant the policy did not fully meet her needs.  For example, there is nothing  to suggest  
Lloyds considered whether Mrs S had any pre-existing medical conditions.
Overall, on the balance of probabilities I am not persuaded that Lloyds  did all it should have 
done to determine whether the policy was suitable for Mrs S given her circumstances. So Im 
not persuaded Lloyds advised with reasonable  care and skill.
Ref: DRN56356035While Im not persuaded Lloyds did all it should  have done  to make sure the policy was 
suitable for Mrs S, I do think  its more likely  than not that the policy  was ultimately  suitable  for 
her. In reaching  that conclusion  Ive taken into consideration:
-Mrs S met the eligibility criteria for the policy.
-Mrs S had a need for the policy   it seems likely that Mrs Ss ability to continue to 
meet her credit card repayments would  have been put under strain if she was not 
working for an extended period  of time  even allowing for her sick pay benefits.
-The monthly cost of the policy appears  to have  been affordable for Mrs S. 
-The exclusions and limitations didnt make the policy unsuitable  for Mrs S. There  was 
nothing about  Mrs Ss employment or occupation  which  would have made it difficult  
for her to claim.  Regarding pre-existing medical  conditions, as Ive explained  above,  
we are aware that Mrs S had undergone two medical procedures some  time before 
the policy was sold. But she didnt require any significant time off work  for these and 
she also hasnt said she experienced any ongoing difficulties with these  health  
issues. So, I dont think these made the policy unsuitable. 
-While  the policy would  only pay benefits  for a maximum of 12 months for each claim 
for disability and unemployment, it still provided useful cover given Mrs Ss 
circumstances. 
Ive also considered whether, when providing  advice,  Lloyds  gave Mrs S sufficient 
information about the cover provided by the policy to enable her to understand what  Lloyds 
was recommending to her and make an informed decision  about  whether to follow that 
advice and take out the policy.
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not Mrs S was given a very broad  description of what the 
policy was intended  to cover (that is, that the policy would protect her card payments in the 
event she was unable  to work through disability or unemployment). I have reached this 
conclusion because I think  Mrs S would have been told this  at the very least   when  she 
applied for the PPI. I also think  its unlikely Mrs S would have taken out the policy  without 
any sense of what the policy was. 
I am also satisfied Mrs S would have  realised the policy  wasnt free and its likely she would 
have had some understanding of how much the policy cost before  agreeing  to take it out.
But the evidence  from the time of the sale doesnt  tell us whether Lloyds gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit, the actual cost (the fact that the premiums  
would be added to the account balance, attracting interest if unpaid  at the end of the month, 
and were payable  during  a claim) or about  the exclusions  and limitations, before Mrs S 
agreed to take out the policy.  
Overall, having considered the parties  representations about what  happened,  while Im 
satisfied that the policy  was a suitable recommendation for Mrs S, Im not persuaded Lloyds 
did enough to present  information about  the policy it was recommending in a way that was 
fair and reasonable to Mrs S. Im not persuaded  that Lloyds gave Mrs S all of the information  
Ref: DRN56356036she needed about the policy to make an informed decision about whether to follow  the 
recommendation and take out the policy.
Ive considered how my findings interact  with the FCAs  list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling  PPI complaints  set out at DISP  App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, Im persuaded that there were significant failings in this case.
In addition to the failings  Ive highlighted above,  Mrs Ss representative has raised a number  
of general points in regards  to the requirements on a business when providing information  in 
PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like Mrs Ss. Ive considered 
these carefully and summarised them  as:
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Mrs Ss representative considers  to be poor 
value  and the fact that much of the premium went  to the business  rather than the 
insurer. 
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  shouldnt have just 
told Mrs S about the limitations and exclusions, it should have gone  further  and 
explained the significance of them to her. 
Im not persuaded by Mrs Ss representatives  views on this. The duty of utmost good faith in 
insurance law imposed a duty on both parties  to the contract  to disclose material facts  and 
not to make  material misrepresentations. While I cannot be certain what  a court would say  
I think its unlikely a court would find that this extended to the insurer  having  to disclose the 
claims ratio information or explaining  the significance of the limitations and exclusions in the 
way Mrs S has suggested. And taking into account the law, industry codes and standards of 
good industry practice applicable to this complaint,  I dont think its fair and reasonable to 
conclude that Lloyds ought  to have done either. 
what effect did Lloydss shortcomings have on Mrs S? To what extent  did Mrs S suffer 
loss or damage as a result?
Ive found that Lloyds  didnt do all it should have done when it sold this policy to Mrs S. So I 
have gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to conclude Mrs S 
suffered loss and damage as a result. To answer  this, I must decide  whether or not Mrs S 
would have still taken  out the policy, had Lloyds done things properly. 
While Im not persuaded that Lloyds took the steps  it should  have done to establish  whether 
the policy it recommended was suitable  for Mrs S, Ive found that the policy  was ultimately 
suitable for her.
In those circumstances it seems to me that, whether  or not Mrs S has suffered loss or 
damage in this case primarily depends  on whether, if Lloyds had explained  things properly, 
Mrs S would have acted differently, or whether  she would have taken out the policy in any 
event.
Mrs S says she would  not have  taken it out and believes that I should  presume this to be the 
case given the significant failings identified  above. I have considered  the representations of 
both sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
Ref: DRN56356037Deciding whether  to follow advice to take out insurance requires the consumer to weigh up a 
number of factors before  deciding  whether to proceed. Effectively the consumer has to 
weigh up the advice to take out the policy, the cost of doing so given the benefits offered in 
return and the potential consequences they will suffer if they dont have  insurance,  should 
the risks come  to fruition.
The evidence in this case suggests that Mrs S had some interest in taking out payment 
protection insurance. By this I mean  when Lloyds  told her that there was a suitable product 
she could buy that would  protect her credit card payments in the event she was unable  to 
work because of accident, sickness and unemployment, I think  she likely  concluded  she 
wanted that product. But she made  that decision based on incomplete  information, meaning 
what she thought  she was getting is not exactly what  she got. 
As I explained earlier, Im satisfied from the evidence about  Mrs Ss circumstances at the 
time of the sale that the policy was not fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her. 
In relation to the costs, Im satisfied Mrs S ought  reasonably to have known  she would have 
to pay something for the PPI and that it would cover  a portion of her outstanding balance.  
But, I accept that Lloyds didnt make clear the on-going cost information.  So while Mrs S 
didnt know some things,  the ultimate position  in the event of a successful claim was not 
dissimilar to what she would reasonably have thought from the information  she based her 
decision to take out the policy on and found acceptable. 
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mrs S thought she had bought and 
what she actually bought were the following:
The policy excluded claims relating to medical  conditions that Mrs S had consulted  or 
received treatment from a doctor in the 12-month period  before  the start date of the 
policy; 
The policy excluded claims relating to mental  health conditions and it contained 
limitations on claims relating to back conditions placing more onerous evidential  
requirements to support  a claim on those grounds;
The policy limited, and in some situations,  excluded unemployment  cover  if Mrs S 
wasnt a permanent employee.
I do accept that there is a possibility that the limitations and exclusions above might  well 
have caused Mrs S pause for thought  and may well have caused her to conclude  that the 
policy wasnt as good as she thought and she might have decided not to proceed.  The 
limitations on the cover, when coupled with the other shortcomings in this sale, might  have 
dissuaded some  consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mrs S from taking out 
the policy. 
But, the evidence  about Mrs Ss circumstances  at the time of sale shows that the policy  
wasnt fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her. She was eligible for its benefits and it 
provided cover that, despite its limitations  and exclusions, couldve proved  valuable to her 
should the insured risks have become a reality. Although Mrs S had undergone two medical 
procedures some time before the policy  was taken out, and the policy  might  not have 
provided cover had she been unable to work because  of these, I dont think better 
information about this exclusion would have  put her off agreeing to it. I say this because she 
hadnt needed any significant time off work for these health concerns, and she hasnt said 
she suffered any ongoing  issues with them since. So, I dont think she would have envisaged 
that these issues  would  be the main  reasons shed need to make  a claim.
Ref: DRN56356038And I havent seen  any evidence  to suggest  she wouldve been caught by any of the other 
significant exclusions. So, I still think she had some good reasons to take the policy out.
I accept back pain and mental health conditions are common problems. In this case the 
policy excluded claims for mental health conditions and the steps required to make  a 
disability claim for back related conditions were more onerous than Mrs S might reasonably 
have expected. But its unlikely she would have expected to be able to make a disability 
claim without  having  to provide some evidence to support that claim.  And while this 
exclusion and limitation might have dissuaded  some consumers in slightly  different 
circumstances to Mrs S from taking out the policy, Mrs S, in her circumstances, still had 
some good  reasons to take it out.
To make a disability claim, Mrs S needed  to be totally unable to do her normal job and not 
be doing any other work. I dont think this is likely to be too different to what  she would have 
expected to make a claim. She bought cover to protect her repayments if she was unable to 
work due to accident, sickness or unemployment. So it seems unlikely she would have 
thought shed been able to make a successful claim if she was still working, whether that be 
in her normal job or any other job.
Having considered all of the evidence  and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not that Mrs S would  still have taken out the PPI. The policy was sufficiently close  to 
what she thought  she was getting and I think the policy  could provide a useful benefit in a 
difficult time, notwithstanding her employment  benefits. And in those circumstances, I 
consider it more likely  than not that she would have taken out the policy  in any event.  
Mrs Ss representatives say the rules about how to handle PPI complaints (DISP App 3) 
make it clear  that, where  a significant  failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have  taken out PPI, unless  there  is evidence  to outweigh  the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms,  but it is a relevant  consideration  so I take it into account along 
with many other things  when I decide  what is in my opinion  fair and reasonable. Considering  
the purpose of the guidance, I dont  think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken.  
I have thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, I have found  it would be reasonable to conclude  there  
were substantial flaws  in the sales  process.  In those  circumstances, DISP App 3 says it 
should be presumed Mrs S would not have bought the PPI she bought  unless, in the 
particular circumstances  of the complaint, there is evidence to rebut the presumption. 
I am satisfied, applying DISP App 3, it is reasonable to conclude  the presumption  is rebutted 
in the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account Mrs Ss 
circumstances as detailed  above, I consider it reasonable to conclude  the position  Mrs S 
found herself in as a result of the sale was the same position  she would have been in had 
the breach or significant  failings not occurred. 
Mrs S believes the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws  in the sales process 
were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were  highly material and we have failed to give 
proper weight to the evidence  including her own comments  that she would not have taken 
out the policy. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Ref: DRN56356039Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance  for firms  set out at DISP App 3 (which  I 
dont consider I am), I am only doing so because  I dont  consider, in this case, that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Mrs S in the position she would have been in if she had 
not bought the policy.  
That is because,  while I accept its possible she wouldnt have taken out the policy, I am 
satisfied that of the two possibilities, its more likely than not that she would  still have taken 
out the PPI had she been given clear,  fair and not misleading information about the policy 
she was buying.  So Im not persuaded it would be fair and reasonable in those 
circumstances, to conclude Lloyds should pay Mrs S compensation, as that would put her in 
a better  position than she would have been in if everything had happened  as it should have 
done. 
Im also aware that Mrs S thinks Lloyds misrepresented  the terms of the policy in how it 
described the PPI. While I accept there is a possibility a court  might  conclude some of 
Lloydss statements misrepresented the contract,  in my opinion  the reason why Lloyds failed 
to act fairly  and reasonably was not because of what it did or didnt say in the information it 
provided  but because  the overall information  Lloyds gave Mrs S, in the way it did, was 
insufficient to meet  the standards I consider it fair and reasonable to expect it to have met in 
1993 (through to 2000) when providing information  about an insurance policy. 
Ive also thought about the approach Mrs Ss representative says a court might take if it were 
to find Lloyds negligently misrepresented the contract to Mrs S and about the remedy  a court  
might award if it were  to find that Lloyds had been in breach of its duty of utmost good  faith.  
But this doesnt  persuade  me to alter my conclusions about what  is fair and reasonable in all 
the circumstances of the complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the 
circumstances of this case.  For the reasons Ive already set out I dont think it would be fair 
and reasonable to put Mrs S in a better position  than if everything  had happened  as it should 
have done. 
my decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 September 2021.
