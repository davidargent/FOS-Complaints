The complaint
Miss S complains that TransUnion International UK Limited recorded someone elses 
information on her credit file. 
What happened
Miss S has told us that in 2020 she found an entry on her credit file that wasnt hers. The 
entry was for someone with the same name and recorded a default on Miss S credit file. 
Miss S checked with TransUnion and contacted the business (L) reporting the disputed 
entry. TransUnion took the step of supressing the entry from Miss S credit file so she could 
dispute it with L. TransUnion also contacted L. 
TransUnion received a response from L in October 2020 that said an amendment had been 
made and would update shortly. But the entry reappeared on Miss S credit file. And Miss S 
has told us she didnt hear back from TransUnion after raising her concerns. 
Miss S says mortgage applications she made werent successful so she took the step of 
checking her credit file again and found TransUnion was still reporting the disputed account 
on her credit file. Miss S complained to L and has provided a copy of a final response that 
confirms the entry in question isnt hers. 
Miss S referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
upheld Miss S complaint and said TransUnion should apply a disassociate between Miss S 
and the third party to ensure the entry is permanently removed from her credit file. The 
investigator also recommended that TransUnion pay Miss S £200 for the trouble and upset 
caused. TransUnion asked to appeal, so Miss S complaint has been passed to me to make 
a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at all the available information and can see Ls final response from August 2021 
confirms Miss S isnt its customer. L has suggested the account in question, which includes 
a default, was recorded against Miss S due to a linked address with the third party. L 
confirmed its unable to amend or remove addresses that are linked by credit reference 
agencies and that Miss S should contact TransUnion to get it removed. 
TransUnion says it was waiting for L to respond with instructions and that it closed Miss S 
initial query after 28 days had passed. TransUnion says it also contacted L on Miss S behalf 
and was told her case was being investigated. But, as Ive noted above, L has since issued 
its own final response that confirms the account doesnt belong to Miss S. 
I think TransUnion shouldve done more to help Miss S after she raised the issue. I 
understand TransUnion failed to get a response from L initially, but it should now have had 
the opportunity to fully investigate Miss S concerns and whether the account should remain 
on her credit file. And Im satisfied Ls response to Miss S complaint shows she isnt its 
customer and that the entry shouldnt show on her credit file. 
TransUnions response to the investigator says the information is reported by L. But L says 
the entry doesnt belong to Miss S and she should contact TransUnion to remove it. Im 
satisfied TransUnion needs to take steps to remove the disputed entry from Miss S credit 
file. L says the entry in question is being recorded on Miss S credit file due to an address 
link. And the investigator has recommended TransUnion apply a disassociation to Miss S 
credit file so the entry doesnt reappear. 
Im satisfied the entry isnt Miss S so TransUnion should take steps, including applying a 
disassociation to Miss S and the third party, to remove the entry permanently from her credit 
file. 
Im also satisfied communication shouldve been better in this case and that Miss S has 
been caused an unreasonable level of distress and inconvenience. As a result, Im also 
going to tell TransUnion to pay Miss S £200 for the reflect the impact of the issues raised on 
her. 
Putting things right
- TransUnion should apply a disassociation between Miss S and the third party and 
amend her credit file to ensure the disputed entry is permanently deleted from her 
credit file
- TransUnion should pay Miss S £200 for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss S complaint and direct TransUnion International UK 
Limited to settle in line with the instructions above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 April 2022.
