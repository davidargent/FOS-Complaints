The complaint
Miss C says Morses Club PLC irresponsibly lent to her. Miss C says she was reliant on this 
type of lending and she got into a spiral of debt. Her credit report would have shown late 
payments, defaults and credit applications. 
What happened
This complaint is about 27 home credit loans Morses provided to Miss C between October 
2011 and December 2019. Miss Cs borrowing history for the first ten loans is as follows

Miss C took a further 17 loans and the amounts borrowed ranged between £200 and £1,000. 
The terms were between 33 and 52 weeks. 
When Miss C complained to Morses, it couldnt find the loan application for loan 11 which 
was taken in May 2014. So, it offered redress to Miss C as it couldnt evidence her income 
and expenditure were checked before agreeing to the loan. Morses said Miss C had an 
outstanding balance of £1,705 as loans 25 and 27 are outstanding, so it would offset the 
redress amount of £516.93 against that. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Cs complaint and thought the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been given. They thought Miss Cs borrowing behaviour showed 
that she was dependent upon this type of lending. 
Morses partially agreed and made an offer to Miss C for loans six, eight, 14, 16, 19, 21, 24, 
25 and 27. We put the offer to Miss C, but she declined it.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for a decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss C 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Morses was required to establish 
whether Miss C could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Miss C didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt be 
upheld. And Morses has already made an offer for loans six, eight, 14, 16, 19, 21, 24, 25 
and 27. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Miss C had with Morses. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Cs complaint.In response to the adjudicator Morses couldnt agree that the loans it didnt uphold werent 
harmful to Miss C. It said its checks were proportionate for the lending and that the lending 
wasnt unsustainable for Miss C.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Morsess lending history with Miss C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Morses should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Morses should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Cs case, and like the adjudicator, I think that this 
point was reached by loan six. I say this because:
At this point Morses ought to have realised Miss C was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss C had taken out six loans and had been indebted to Morses 
for 12 months. So Morses ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss C 
was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances and that Miss Cs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
We dont know how much Miss C borrowed for loan one but loan two was for £100 
and loan six was for £400. And the term of the loan had increased from 34 weeks to 
50 weeks.  At this point Morses ought to have known that Miss C was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
A pattern was beginning to develop by loan six where Miss C was provided with a 
new loan within days of settling a previous one, and this continued. And I note that 
Miss C often had more than one loan running at a time which increased her weekly 
repayments. 
Miss C wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Morses. Loan 27 
was taken out over eight years after Miss Cs first. And it was for a larger amount 
than loan two. Miss C had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt 
to Morses over an extended period.
I think that Miss C lost out because Morses continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Cs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Miss C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Miss Cs ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans six to 27 and Morses should put things right.
Putting things right
For completeness Ive included the loans that Morses has already made an offer on.If there is an outstanding balance due on Miss Cs loans and it has been transferred to a 
third party Morses should buy the loans back if it can. If Morses cant buy the loans back, 
then it needs to work with the third party to make sure the following is achieved: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Miss C towards interest, fees 
and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss C which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss C originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Miss C as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. 
If this results in Miss C having made overpayments then Morses should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 
Morses should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step 
E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus, then the surplus should be paid to Miss C. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Morses should try to agree an affordable repayment plan 
with Miss C. 
E) The number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans six to 27 should be 
removed from Miss Cs credit file. Morses does not have to remove any outstanding 
loans from Miss Cs credit file until these have been repaid, but any adverse 
information recorded about these loans should still be removed.
                                                                                                                                 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to take off tax from this interest. Morses must 
give Miss C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
If after doing the above Miss C still has an outstanding balance due, then Morses should try 
and work together to come to a mutually agreeable repayment plan with Miss C in order to 
repay what is owed. But Id remind Morses of its obligation to treat Miss C fairly. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Cs complaint. Morses Club PLC 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 October 2020.
