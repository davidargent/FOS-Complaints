Mr H says he should not have been  encouraged  to take on further debt and the rolling  
payday loans  left him completely stressed  and filled with anxiety.
In its final response,  Sunny said it had reviewed  the account opening  procedures  and that it 
had conducted  creditworthiness checks, assessed Mr Hs ability  to afford  the repayments 
and considered how Mr H was managing other  debts at that time. Based  upon the checks  it 
carried out, it was considered responsible  to advance  credit to Mr H. It did not uphold  Mr Hs 
complaint. 
Our adjudicator initially told Sunny to put things right from loan 6 onwards.  Sunny did not 
agree but put forward a suggested settlement  to refund loan 9 onwards. It said it considered  
it may have  been  prudent to have asked more questions when Mr H repaid his loan and 
borrowed again the same  day. 
Before being passed to me the case was reviewed and this time another  adjudicator said 
that he thought  Sunny  shouldnt have  given loans 7-12. He explained that by loan 5 Mr H 
had been borrowing frequently  within a short time and so Sunny should have performed a 
full financial review. He told the parties that hed looked at Mr Hs credit file and he couldnt 
see anything concerning about Mr Hs financial position when Sunny gave him loans 5 and 
6. However he said that by loan 7, Mr H had requested his third successive £500 loan from 
Sunny and this was the fifth batch  of loans and it was clear  that Mr H was showing 
dependence on the loans  Sunny was providing  him.
 
Ref: DRN75748552Sunny did not respond and as the parties  have not reached agreement  the complaint has 
been passed to me to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.  Ive decided that loans 7-12 should  not 
have been provided. I will explain why.
Ref: DRN75748553As our adjudicator explained, for loans 1-4 this was early on in the lending relationship and 
the checks it carried out were likely proportionate and sufficient. Based on the information  
Mr H had provided Sunny I dont  think this would have highlighted that the loans were 
unaffordable or that Mr H was having  problems managing money.
When Sunny  gave Mr H loans 5 and 6 I think it should have done  more to check  Mr Hs 
financial circumstances. Mr H has provided  a copy of his credit file from the time Sunny gave 
him loans  5 and 6. I have considered this carefully.  As our adjudicator  explained for the 
period Mr H took out loans 5 and 6 there  was nothing of concern recorded which  might  have 
alerted Sunny to the fact Mr H was having problems managing  his money  at that time. I can 
see Mr H had one other  loan at the time of taking out loans 5 and 6 with another  lender but 
there is no indication  that Mr H was having  repayment issues  and theres nothing else of 
concern on the credit  file for example,  a debt management plan or something  else which 
might have pointed  to Mr Hs financial difficulty.  So, I dont uphold the complaint about loans 
1-6.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr H was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. This was Mr Hs seventh loan in just over three months,  but it was also 
the third time Mr H had borrowed £500 and was the fifth batch of lending. So, Mr H 
borrowed loans 1 and 2 within a few days of each  other and loan 1 wasnt repaid 
when Mr H took out loan 2. Mr H borrowed loans 3 and 4 at around the same time. 
He then borrowed loan 5 in another tranche and loan 6 only a few days  later after 
repaying loan 5. And Mr H had been indebted to Sunny for all that time save for few 
small periods in between. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely than 
not Mr H was having to borrow  further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan 
was leaving in his finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
Mr Hs first loan was for £350.00  and loan 7 was for £500.  At this point Sunny ought 
to have known  that Mr H was not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr H was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one. Loan 8 was given only two days after repaying loan 7. Loan  9 was 
given on the same  day as repaying  loan 8. From  then on it seems Mr H took out 
loans 10,11, and 12 while he was still repaying loan 9.
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  12 was 
taken out for £50 in just over 5 months after he had taken loan 1. And although  it was 
for a smaller  sum, by this time he still had loans 9,10 and 11 outstanding.  So, in 
effect he was repaying more  than he had been required to pay throughout his lending 
relationship with Sunny. Mr H had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service 
a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
Ref: DRN75748554I think that Mr H lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Hs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 7-12 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 7 -12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7-12 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 May 2020.
