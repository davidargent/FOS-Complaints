The complaint
Miss P complains that Mitsubishi HC Capital UK plc, trading as Hitachi Capital, wont refund 
to her the money that she paid for some holiday club membership point rights. Her partner is 
also involved in her complaint and shes being represented by a claims management 
company.
What happened
I understand that Miss P and her partner had bought a trial membership of a holiday club 
from a holiday company in May 2019. The holiday company says that they traded in that trial 
membership and bought 800 holiday club membership point rights in February 2020. They 
entered into an acquisition agreement with the holiday company which showed that the 
purchase price was £10,340. Miss P also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Hitachi Capital for a loan of £13,976, which included £3,636 to repay the outstanding amount 
of the loan that she and her partner had taken out in May 2019. Miss P agreed to make 120 
monthly repayments of £194.84 to Hitachi Capital. 
Miss Ps representative made claims, on behalf of Miss P, to Hitachi Capital under sections 
75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in August 2021. It said that: the product was 
mis-sold and misrepresented to Miss P and her partner; the contract was breached; 
commission was paid between Hitachi Capital and the holiday company which wasnt 
disclosed to Miss P which created a breach of fiduciary duty and caused an unfair 
relationship; the loan was unaffordable; and Miss P and her partners relationship with the 
holiday company was so one-sided as to substantially limit their ability to make an informed 
choice.
Hitachi Capital provided a detailed response in which it set out the reasons that it wasnt 
upholding Miss Ps claims. Miss P wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was 
made to this service. Miss Ps complaint form says that the holiday company and Hitachi 
Capital failed to conduct a proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan; Hitachi Capital 
paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to her and the holiday 
company unduly pressured her and her partner into entering into the acquisition agreement 
and her into entering into the loan agreement; all rendering the loan agreement unfair 
pursuant to section 140A.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Miss Ps complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that Hitachi Capitals decision to turn down the claims was unfair or unreasonable. She 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale. She said that she 
hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Miss P and Hitachi Capital was 
unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the 
relationship was unfair. She later also that she hadnt seen anything to persuade her that the 
lending was unaffordable for Miss P given her financial circumstances at the time of sale.
Miss Ps representative, on behalf of Miss P, says that Miss P doesnt agree with our 
investigators recommendation and would like her complaint to be referred to an 
ombudsman. It has provided a generic submission from a legal counsel about the holiday 
company and the unfair terms that it uses. It has also raised concerns about the way that the 
finance was sold to Miss P and says that the holiday company wasnt regulated to act as a 
credit intermediary, didnt broker proper credit and failed to meet the standard of a regulated 
firm. It has referred to a decision issued by this service on a complaint relating to a different 
type of holiday ownership product in which it says the voluminous documentation for the 
product was reviewed and the debtor-creditor relationship was considered to be unfair. It 
says that the same voluminous documents and the same unfair charges exist in the product 
that was sold to Miss P and her partner so Miss Ps relationship with Hitachi Capital is unfair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Miss Ps complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Miss P and her partner signed the acquisition agreement in February 2020 to buy 
800 holiday club membership point rights  I understand that they traded-in a trial 
membership but there was no reference in the acquisition agreement to a trade-in of 
a trial membership;
they also signed other documents including a members declaration, a standard 
information form, and a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be 
given to withdraw from the agreement, and Miss P signed a loan application and the 
loan agreement;
Miss Ps representative made claims to Hitachi Capital in August 2021 and Miss P 
then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter refers to claims under 
sections 75 and 140A, including that the point rights were misrepresented to Miss P 
and her partner, but her complaint form only refers to claims under section 140A and 
doesnt refer to misrepresentations made by the holiday company;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Miss Ps claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Hitachi 
Capitals response to her claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
the August 2021 letter says that the points were misrepresented to Miss P and her 
partner because:
they were advised that the purchase would enable them to make significant 
savings on their holidays, have access to exclusive accommodation and to 
make a profit;
they were advised that the product was of some substance but its worthless 
and has no merit;
the product was designed to offer an investment return; and
they were advised that they were, in effect, purchasing property;
neither Miss P nor her representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, the conversations that took place or the information that was provided to Miss P and her 
partner before they bought the point rights;
the members declaration that was signed by Miss P and her partner says: We 
understand that any points we may purchase will be for a limited duration and expire 
on 31/12/2034 (Term) and that we have the flexibility to use such Points when we 
wish to reserve holidays during the Term. All reservations are made strictly on a first 
come basis and subject to availability; and: We understand that [the holiday 
company] does not and will not run any resale or rental programmes and will not 
repurchase Vacation Club Points other than as a trade in against future property 
purchases;
it also said: We understand that the purchase of our membership in Vacation Club is 
for the primary purpose of holidays and is not for the purposes of a real estate 
interest or an investment in real estate, and that [the holiday company] makes no 
representation as to the future price or value of the Vacation Club Holiday product. 
We understand that if we consider trading in any of our Points and it is not possible 
because of circumstances or due to availability of suitable properties, we still hold our 
points to use on holiday reservations;
Ive seen no evidence to support Miss Ps claim that she and her partner were 
advised that the purchase would enable them to make significant savings on their 
holidays, have access to exclusive accommodation and to make a profit;
the point rights could be used by Miss P and her partner to reserve holidays until 
December 2034 so I consider that they do have value and arent worthless but I dont 
consider that Miss P and her partner were purchasing property or that the point rights 
could properly be considered to be an investment and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to support Miss Ps claim that she and her partner were advised 
that the point rights were an investment or that they were purchasing property;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the point rights were 
misrepresented to Miss P and her partner by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the acquisition agreement by any such misrepresentations;
the August 2021 letter says that the contract between Miss P and her partner and the 
holiday company was breached but the letter provides no further information about 
the alleged breach of contract and Ive seen no evidence to show that theres been a 
breach of contract by the holiday company for which Hitachi Capital would be liable 
under section 75;
the August 2021 letter also says that commission was paid between Hitachi Capital 
and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Miss P which created a breach of 
fiduciary duty and caused an unfair relationship and Miss Ps complaint form says 
that Hitachi Capital paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared 
to her;
the members declaration says that the holiday company:  has a commercial 
arrangement with the lender who is providing the loan you have requested and as 
part of those commercial terms we may be entitled to a commission from the lender. 
Details of commission in respect of your loan are available on request by you quoting 
your contract number; so I consider that Miss P and her partner ought to have been 
aware that Hitachi Capital might be paying a commission to the holiday company but 
Ive seen no evidence to show that they asked either it or the holiday company for 
any information about the commission before the claim about the commission was 
made in August 2021;
Hitachi Capital hasnt provided any evidence to show what commission, if any, it paid 
to the holiday company but, from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less than 15% and Im satisfied 
that Hitachi Capital wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  
nor was it under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid 
in these circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that 
was normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Hitachi 
Capital should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Miss P risked 
the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
the August 2021 letter says that the loan was unaffordable for Miss P and her 
complaint form says that the holiday company and Hitachi Capital failed to conduct a 
proper assessment of her ability to afford the loan  but the evidence provided by 
Miss P includes a copy of the loan agreement which contains property and 
employment information for Miss P;
Miss P also signed a loan application and the loan application and the information on 
the loan agreement both show that she was an employed property owner with a 
gross income of £62,000;
Hitachi Capital says that it searched Miss Ps credit record to check information and it 
used the credit record along with other information provided on the application to 
calculate an overall score for Miss P which exceeded its minimum lending criteria  it 
says that it uses a third party affordability product to assist it with understanding the 
affordability of any new credit and there were no indications that Miss P would 
struggle to service the loan;
it says that it estimated Miss P's net monthly income as £3,707 from which it 
deducted the monthly payments for her existing credit commitments, her mortgage 
and the loan repayment which would leave approximately £1,948 each month for 
other expenses so it considered the loan to be affordable for her;
the members declaration says: We understand clearly what we have purchased 
and, having carefully considered this and our other financial commitments, are able 
to pay the amounts due on the dates agreed and in the case of purchases made with 
the assistance of finance agree that we are not aware of any future event that may 
prevent us from meeting the monthly repayments;
neither Miss P nor her representative has provided detailed evidence about Miss Ps 
financial position in February 2020 or to show that the loan wasnt affordable for her 
at that time;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show a loan with a monthly 
payment of £194.84 wasnt affordable for Miss P in February 2020, that Hitachi 
Capital should have done more to assess the affordability of the loan for her, that the 
loan was mis-sold to her or that Hitachi Capital has acted incorrectly in connection 
with the loan;
the August 2021 letter also says that Miss P and her partners relationship with the 
holiday company was so one-sided as to substantially limit their ability to make an 
informed choice  but Miss P and her partner had bought a trial membership of the 
holiday club in May 2019 and the holiday company says that they then traded-in the 
trial membership for the point rights and Im not persuaded that enough evidence has 
been provided to show that they werent able to make an informed choice; 
Miss Ps complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured her and her 
partner into entering into the acquisition agreement and her into entering into the loan 
agreement - but Miss P and her partner had signed the separate standard form of the 
withdrawal notice that could be given to withdraw from the acquisition agreement 
within 14 days without giving any reason and Ive seen no evidence to show that they contacted either the holiday company or Hitachi Capital to withdraw from the 
acquisition agreement within the withdrawal period;
the loan agreement also set out Miss Ps right to withdraw from it without giving any 
reason for a period of 14 days but Ive seen no evidence to show that she contacted 
Hitachi Capital to withdraw from the loan agreement within the withdrawal period;
the members declaration says: We have received a copy of our Agreement together 
with the notices and Information Statement (which we have had adequate time to 
review before signing) required under the EU Timeshare Directive 2008/122/EC;
if Miss P and her partner had been unduly pressured into signing the acquisition 
agreement and didnt want to buy the point rights, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have contacted either the holiday company or Hitachi 
Capital within the applicable withdrawal periods;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Miss P and her partner 
were unduly pressurised into entering into the acquisition agreement or that Miss P 
was unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Miss Ps representative has provided a generic submission from a legal counsel 
about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses  but it would be for a 
court to determine whether or not any of the terms in the agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Miss P and her partner 
and I consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances 
that the terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Miss P and 
Hitachi Capital;
Miss Ps representative has referred to a decision issued by this service on a 
complaint relating to a different type of holiday ownership product in which it says the 
voluminous documentation for the product was reviewed and the debtor-creditor 
relationship was considered to be unfair  it says that the same voluminous 
documents and the same unfair charges exist in the product that was sold to Miss P 
and her partner so Miss Ps relationship with Hitachi Capital is unfair;
that decision related to a different type of holiday ownership product which was sold 
as an investment and related to a specified property  Miss P and her partner bought 
some point rights from the holiday company which dont relate to a specified property 
and which I dont consider were sold to them as an investment;
both products were often sold in similar ways and may have had similar contractual 
documentation but the operation and effect of the contractual documentation would 
be significantly different between the products;
Miss Ps representative says that the holiday company wasnt regulated to act as a 
credit intermediary but that claim wasnt included in the claim that was made to 
Hitachi Capital in August 2021 and wasnt included by Miss P in her complaint form 
so Im unable to consider it in this decision  but the credit intermediary was identified 
on the loan agreement and this services records show that that credit intermediary is 
authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Miss Ps relationship 
with Hitachi Capital was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Miss P and Hitachi Capital in 
these circumstances;
I sympathise with Miss P for the issues that she and her partner have had with their 
point rights but I consider that Hitachi Capitals response to the claims that had been 
made to it was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Hitachi Capital to refund to Miss P any of the money that shes paid under the loan 
agreement, to cancel the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 November 2023.
