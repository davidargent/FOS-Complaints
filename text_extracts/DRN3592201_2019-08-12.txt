K821x#15complaint
Miss D says Gain  Credit LLC trading as Lending Stream lent to her irresponsibly. She says 
the loans were such a burden that she struggled  to meet  her normal  household 
expenditures. 
background
This complaint is about 28 instalment loans Lending Stream provided  to Miss D between 
July 2015 and July 2017. Ive attached a table to the end of this decision which contains 
some further  information about this lending. And Miss D continued to borrow after this time 
from another trading name of Gain Credit. This further lending  is being considered under a 
separate complaint. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. Lending  Stream  didnt agree with the 
adjudicators opinion so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss D 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
Ref: DRN35922012without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ds complaint. Ive decided to uphold Miss Ds 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Miss D didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion  about loans 1 to 5. Because of this 
I dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about these loans. So I wont  be making  a 
decision about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Miss D had with 
Lending Stream. So they are something I will take into account when considering the other  
loans she took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 28 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Lending 
Streams lending history with Miss D, with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which 
Lending Stream should reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. And so Lending  Stream should  have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ds case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
up to loan 6 the amounts Miss D was borrowing hadnt been  decreasing,  And at loan 
6 Miss D and Lending Stream  had been  in a lending relationship  for over six months. 
Going forward Miss D continued to borrow for around another  year and a half without 
a significant break
so Lending  Stream ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Miss D was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loans were leaving in 
her finances and that Miss Ds indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably
Miss D wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount she owed Lending  Stream. 
Loan 28 was taken out around two years  after Miss Ds first. And it was for a larger 
amount. Miss D had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in effect; service a debt to 
Lending Stream over an extended period
I think that Miss D lost out because Lending  Stream continued to provide borrowing from 
loan 6 onwards  because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ds indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period of time
the sheer number  of loans (loans  and deferrals) was likely to have had negative 
implications on Miss Ds ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 28 and Lending Stream should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Lending Stream needs to do
Ref: DRN35922013refund  all interest and charges Miss D paid on loans 6 to 28;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 28 should be removed from 
Miss Ds credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Miss D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Miss Ds complaint.
Gain Credit LLC should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 September 2019.
