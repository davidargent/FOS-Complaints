The complaint
Mr H is unhappy about the way in which HSBC handled his chargeback claim.
What happened
In March 2020 Mr L raised a chargeback claim with HSBC. There were delays in the process 
and both Mr L and his wife contacted HSBC several times to chase up a resolution.
Mr L made a formal complaint in September 2020. The case handler apologised for the 
delay and advised Mr L that his chargeback claim had been rejected. Later, in November 
2020 the case handler advised Mr L that he had made an error and that the dispute had 
been resolved in Mr Ls favour. The case handler apologised for the error and HSBC 
credited Mr L with Â£100 compensation.
Mr L wasnt happy with the outcome and brought his complaint to this service.
I issued a provisional decision in which I said that I thought the apology and the 
compensation was a fair and reasonable resolution to the complaint.
I invited both parties to let me have any comments or further arguments they wished to raise. 
Neither party had any information to add.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither party has raised any further arguments or provided any additional information. In the 
circumstances, I see no reason to reach a  different conclusion to that which I reached in my 
provisional decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 September 2022.
