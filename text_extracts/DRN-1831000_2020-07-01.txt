The complaint
Miss H complains that Monzo Bank Ltd (Monzo) gave her bad advice after she lost her card 
while she was abroad. Miss H says Monzo's actions led to her losing a £400 transfer. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Monzo has explained that when a customer loses their card it blocks it. Monzo also 
blocks any associated mobile banking pay applications. I appreciate that meant Miss 
H had limited options as she was abroad without an alternative payment method. But 
Monzo acted in line with its procedure when a card is lost and Im satisfied its actions 
were intended to protect Miss Hs account. 
Ive reviewed the chat logs and can see that Monzo told Miss H that she could use a 
third party business to transfer funds to a friend while she was abroad. Given the 
limited options Miss H had at the time, I think Monzo reasonably provided information 
about a money transfer service she could use via online banking.
Miss H provided the details for the account she wanted funds to be transferred to. I 
haven't seen anything that shows Monzo influenced Miss H's decision about who to 
transfer funds to. 
I havent found any evidence to show Monzo gave Miss H poor advice but I agree it 
could have provided more information about transfer timescales. Monzo offered Miss 
H £50 and apologised. Im satisfied thats a fair way to resolve this complaint. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 July 2020.
