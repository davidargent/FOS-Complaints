K820x#14complaint
Mr W has complained that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money)  lent to him
irresponsibly. Hes also complained that the lender acted unfairly  towards him in other  ways.
background
I issued a provisional decision about this complaint  in November 2020 that I summarise 
below.
Mr W was given a loan of £2,000 by 118 118 Money  in September 2018.  The loan was due
to be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of around £155. The total amount payable, including
interest was just over £3,720. I understand the loan account is now closed.
Mr W thinks that the loan was unaffordable. Hes complained that when he first applied for a
loan he was rejected,  but when he applied using a different email, his application was
accepted. Mr W has also complained that money was stolen from his bank  account  which  he
says was due to an IT glitch at the lender.
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, in particular the checks  that 118 
118 Money needed to do such as the amount being lent, and the consumers  income and 
expenditure. 
I considered some overarching questions in order to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this particular complaint:
Did 118 118 Money complete  reasonable and proportionate checks  to satisfy itself 
that Mr W would be able to repay  his loan in a sustainable way? If not, what  would 
reasonable and proportionate checks have shown at the time?
Ultimately  did it make  a fair lending decision?
Did 118 118 Money act unfairly  or unreasonably towards Mr W in some  other  way?
I said that 118 118 Money needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't  lend to Mr 
W irresponsibly and it had to carry out proportionate  checks to satisfy itself that Mr W could 
repay his loan in a sustainable way.
118 118 Money says it carried  out some checks before it gave the loan to Mr W. This
included asking for details of his income and expenditure and acquiring a credit  report.  118
118 Money says that, based on the information  Mr W provided and what  it found  in its
checks, the loan was affordable.
But 118 118 Money was aware from its credit report that Mr W had opened 13 new accounts
in the last 6 months. He had at least 4 open  loans  - all of which  carried fairly substantial
monthly repayments and his total credit balance  was around £11,600. I accepted that 177 
out of the 183 total accounts  had been settled.  But the report showed that Mr W had been 
fairly regularly borrowing  from other  lenders in the months leading up to his application to 
118 118 Money. I thought all of this ought to have suggested that Mr W might  be finding it 
difficult to get out from under his financial problems.
118 118 Money says that even when Mr Ws existing  credit commitments were  taken into
account, the loan was still affordable and his history of repayments was good.  But Mr W was
applying to 118 118 Money  for an expensive loan, and he had to maintain his repayments
Ref: DRN41714462every month for two years. The notes that 118 118 Money has provided  suggest that it had
doubts at the time about some of the information  that Mr W had given on his application
form, so it adjusted its calculations to check that the loan was affordable.  But it didnt seem
to me that 118 118 Money raised  these doubts  with Mr W at the time or queried the
information hed given about  his income  and regular  expenditure.
Taking everything into account,  I would have expected the lender to want  to obtain a
thorough understanding of Mr Ws financial  position - including  a more independent check  of
his regular monthly income  and expenses - to satisfy  itself that he could sustainably meet his
loan repayments  over the whole loan term. Overall, from what  Id seen, I couldnt fairly  say
that the checks 118 118 Money carried out were reasonable and proportionate.
So as well as asking  Mr W about his income and expenditure and acquiring a credit  check,  I
thought 118 118 Money  ought  reasonably to have  carried  out more  detailed and 
independent checks  into his financial circumstances - for example by asking to see a bank  
statement.
However, from the evidence Id seen, it wasnt clear whether better checks by 118 118
Money would  have uncovered anything that would have shown that Mr W might have
difficulty repaying his loan sustainably. Mr W says that the loan wasnt affordable. He was
asked if he was able to provide more information by this Service, but he wasnt  able to do so. 
So although  I thought the lender should have done more  to check Mr Ws true financial 
position before it agreed to lend to him, I couldnt  fairly say that better checks ought 
reasonably to have  led 118 118 Money to conclude that it shouldnt  lend to Mr W. And on the 
basis of the evidence given, I couldnt fairly  say that 118 118 Money lent to Mr W 
irresponsibly.
Mr W complained  that when he first applied  for a loan he was rejected, but when he
applied using a different  email, his application  was accepted, even though he now thinks that
118 118 Money shouldnt have lent to him. Mr W says he no longer  has access  to his
previous emails.118  118 Money has provided  us with details of an application that Mr W
made in 2015  which  was rejected. From  what Ive seen, it seems likely that this earlier
application is the one that Mr W recalls  being rejected. As it was some time before his 2018
loan was given,  I didnt think it was unreasonable for 118 118 Money to have re-considered
another application from Mr W, from a different email, some  years after he first applied for
lending.
Mr W also complained that nearly £6,000 was stolen from his bank account due to an
IT glitch. But Mr W has not provided  any further evidence about this or explained why he
thinks, if funds are missing, that it was the fault of 118 118 Money. I said that if Mr W has 
any concerns that funds  have been  taken  from his account in error or unlawfully, then he 
should contact  118 118 Money  or the police directly.
Overall I hadnt seen anything which made me think that 118 118 Money acted unfairly or
unreasonably towards  Mr W in some other way. And Id not seen enough  evidence  for me
to say that I thought its likely that, if 118 118 Money  had carried out better  checks when Mr 
W applied for the loan,  it ought reasonably to have come to the conclusion  that it was
inappropriate to lend to him. 
I invited both parties to send me any further comments or evidence. 
Ref: DRN41714463118 118 Money told us it accepts my provisional  decision. Mr W says he disagrees with my 
provisional decision and hes provided some further comments. 
In summary,  Mr W says he thinks he previously took out a loan with 118 118 Money some 
years ago using a different email address. He says when  he applied  in 2018 he was initially 
rejected but was then accepted when he set up a new account using a different email  
address. And that he wasnt taken through the full vetting process. Mr W says hes repaid 
the loan but he thinks he should get some  money back due to the amount  of interest hes 
paid.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to thank both parties for all the information  that has been provided about  this matter 
and for responding to my provisional decision.  
Ive considered Mr Ws additional comments but they havent changed my view of his 
complaint.
From the evidence Ive seen, Mr W made an application to 118 118 Money  in 2015  which  
was rejected. As I explained  in my provisional decision, it seems likely  that this earlier  
application is the one that Mr W recalls  being rejected. As it was some time before his 2018 
application for a loan was accepted, I didnt think it was unreasonable  for 118 118 Money to 
have re-considered another application from Mr W, from a different email,  some years after 
he first applied  for lending.
Mr W has told us that he wasnt  taken through  the full vetting  process when he applied for 
his loan. In my provisional decision, I explained  that I thought the lender should have carried  
out more in-depth  checks before it agreed to lend to Mr W. But I also explained that I hadnt 
seen enough evidence from Mr W about  his financial circumstances at the time for me to 
fairly say that better checks ought reasonably  to have  led 118 118 Money to conclude that it 
shouldnt lend to him.  
I understand that Mr W feels strongly about  his complaint. But Id like to reassure him that I 
have carefully considered  everything that both he and 118 118 Money have told us and all 
the information that has been provided about this matter. But as neither Mr W nor 118 118 
Money has provided any further  evidence or comment that changes my mind about this 
complaint,  I confirm the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.  
On the basis of the evidence given, I cannot  fairly say that 118 118 Money lent to Mr W 
irresponsibly and I havent seen anything which makes me think  the lender acted unfairly  or 
unreasonably towards  Mr W in some other way. So I am not upholding Mr Ws complaint.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I dont uphold the complaint or make  any award against 
Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money.
Ref: DRN41714464Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 January 2021.
