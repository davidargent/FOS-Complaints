K821x#15Complaint
Miss D says CashEuroNet UK LLC (CEN), trading as QuickQuid (QQ) and Pounds to 
Pocket (PtP)  lent to her irresponsibly.
Background
Miss D had six loans with CEN. Loans  1 to 5 were payday loans repayable in two payments 
 the first a payment  of interest only and the second a payment of capital and interest. Loan 
6 was an instalment  loan,  repayable in equal  instalments over 12 months. Ive summarised 
some of the information  CEN provided about  the loans in the table below.
Loan  no.

An adjudicator considered  the complaint and recommended it be upheld in part. She didnt 
think CEN was right to have approved  loans  2 to 6. CEN didnt agree with the adjudicator,  so 
the complaint  was passed to me to decide.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
Having looked  at everything, I dont think CEN acted unfairly when it approved loan 1. It 
didnt have any experience of Miss D as a customer at that point and from what  Ive seen 
had no reason to suspect  she was in financial difficulty. The largest payment of £480  doesnt 
appear to be obviously  unaffordable when compared to Miss Ds declared income of £1,300 
per month. So I think CENs decision to approve  loan 1 was reasonable.
I dont think the decision  to approve loan 2 was reasonable.  Loan  1 was originally scheduled 
to be repaid on 30 June 2010  but Miss D had to extend the repayment  date by two months 
to August  2010.  She then borrowed  again  just one day after repaying loan 1 and borrowed 
twice as much. The largest payment of £960  was around two thirds  of her net month income,  
which she had declared as £1,500. CEN  didnt  obtain  any information about  Miss Ds 
expenditure at this time  but I think it shouldve realised such a large  repayment  was likely 
to be unsustainable.  
Ive noted what  CEN  has said about  loan 2 being due across two months   so Miss D had 
£3,000 of income across those two months. But I dont think it was reasonable for CEN  to 
assume Miss D was in a position to save from month-to-month,  particularly given that she 
had to extend her first loan and then found  herself  having to borrow  again  immediately. 
I therefore dont  think it was reasonable for CEN  to have  approved  loan 2.
Loan 2 was originally due to be repaid in October 2010 but wasnt  repaid until January 2011 
 Miss D extended her loan by a little over two months but also missed payments and was 
Ref: DRN94637072charged late fees during this time. She then returned for loan 3 after another gap of just one 
day. Ive noted  that Miss D borrowed less for loan 3 than the preceding loan. But given the 
conduct of loans 1 and 2 and the lack of any break in the borrowing up to this point, I think 
CEN shouldve realised that Miss D was experiencing problems with her repayments and 
that there  was a significant risk loan 3 wouldnt be sustainably  affordable for her. I note that 
this is borne out by the way Miss D extended  loan 3 in the same way she had the preceding 
loans. So I dont think CEN acted fairly when it approved loan 3.
Loans 4 to 6 were approved without  breaks in the lending which I would consider to be 
significant. Ive noted the 43 day gap between loans 4 and 5 but dont consider that 
significant given  that by loan 5 Miss D had been  borrowing from CEN for well over a year  
despite these  loans being intended for only short-term use. The amounts  Miss D borrowed 
also continued to increase   suggesting it was likely Miss D was borrowing further  to cover 
the hole repaying  her previous loans  was leaving in her finances.
By continuing to lend to Miss D and approving loan 4 and the subsequent loans, CEN 
unfairly prolonged Miss Ds indebtedness by allowing her to take expensive credit intended 
for short-term use over an extended  period  of time.  So I dont think CEN acted fairly  when it 
approved loans 4 to 6.
Ive considered the points CEN  made about the pattern of borrowing not demonstrating  the 
loans were unaffordable. But CEN  will know, from our website and previous decisions, this 
services approach to complaints of this nature. And for the reason given above, I dont 
agree that the pattern of borrowing isnt a relevant consideration in Miss Ds complaint.
Im therefore  upholding the complaint  about loans 2 to 6.
Putting things  right
CEN should refund the interest and charges Miss D paid for loans 2 to 5, adding 
interest at 8% simple  per year from when Miss D paid them  until the date of 
settlement
CEN should remove any negative information about loans 2 to 3 from Miss Ds credit  
history and remove all information about  loans 4 to 6 (and ask any relevant third 
party to do the same)
CEN has said that Miss D didnt  fully repay  loan 6. So CEN should remove  all interest  and 
charges from loan 6 and treat any payments made as if they were payments  towards  the 
principal. It can then deduct what it owes Miss D from the balance of loan 6  although it can 
only make  this deduction if it still owns the debt. 
If CEN doesnt own the debt for loan 6 (and cant take it back) it will need to ensure Miss D 
doesnt pay more  than the £1,050 she borrowed. For example, it can make a payment  to the 
third party equivalent  to the amount of interest and charges added. Or it could pay that 
amount directly to Miss D to use for the same  purpose.
HM Revenue & Customs requires CEN  to take off tax from this interest. CEN must give Miss D a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN94637073My final decision
I uphold Miss Ds complaint in part. CashEuroNet UK LLC must  put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 31 August 2019.
