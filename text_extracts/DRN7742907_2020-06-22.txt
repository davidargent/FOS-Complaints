K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains about the amount  that he will be charged by ALD Automotive Limited when 
he returns his car at the end of his hire agreement.
background
A new car was supplied  to Mr B under a hire agreement with ALD Automotive that he signed  
in July 2018. The agreement was for three years and showed  that the car had been  
registered in June 2018  but it had been registered  in April 2018 so the three year warranty  
would end before the hire agreement ended.
Mr B complained to ALD Automotive  and it agreed  that he could return the car in 
June 2021 (even though  the agreement  was due to end in August 2021) and it offered  to 
credit his account  with £130 as a refund of the amount  that he would be overpaying 
under the agreement.  Mr B wasnt satisfied with its response so complained  to this service. 
He says that the credit was based on the normal monthly amount of £214 rather than the 
true monthly cost which,  taking into account the up-front payment, is £261.75 and that it 
doesnt reflect the rental period accurately.
The investigator recommended  that this complaint should be upheld.  He said that the total 
payment under the agreement would  have been  £9,441.08 which was a daily rate of 
£8.6219. So, if the car was returned on 11 June 2021, 58 days early, the refund due to Mr B 
would be £285.50   but he said that the refund would need to be actioned at the end of the 
agreement and should be reviewed nearer the time to ensure that it was accurate.
ALD Automotive asked the investigator  to clarify some points about his recommendation  
which he did  but it hasnt responded since then. Mr B says that he declined  the offer of 
£130 so that payment wasnt made  but that £103 was credited to his account in 
September 2019. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
ALD Automotive accepts that Mr B was given incorrect information about the registration 
date of the car  its apologised for that and has agreed that he can end the agreement  in 
June 2021. A date of 11 June 2021 has been discussed for him to return the car but the 
exact return date will need to be agreed  nearer  the time. 
ALD Automotive offered  to credit £130  to Mr Bs account and said that he wouldnt need to 
make the June 2021 or July 2021 payments under the agreement. He didnt accept its offer 
but he says that it credited £103  to his account  in September 2019.
Mr B made an advance payment of £1,931.15 and agreed to make  35 monthly payments of 
£214.57. I consider  that any adjustment to the amount paid by Mr B at the end of the 
agreement should  be based on the total amount payable under the agreement  and not just 
the monthly payments. The investigator  has calculated that Mr B would be due a refund of 
£285.50 if the car is returned on 11 June 2021. 
Ref: DRN77429072I consider that to be fair and reasonable  but any refund  should  be calculated  nearer the 
time when  the date and circumstances of the return will be known with more certainty. Any 
refund will also need to take account of the credit that has been made by ALD Automotive  
and will be subject to any end of contract charges that would be payable  by Mr B.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint and I order ALD Automotive 
Limited to calculate  any refund that is due to him at the end of the hire agreement using a 
daily rate that is based on both the advance payment and the monthly rentals.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 July 2020.
