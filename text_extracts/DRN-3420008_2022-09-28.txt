The complaint
Mr and Mrs S complain that GE Money Consumer Lending Limited has rejected the claims 
that theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs S entered into an trial membership agreement with a holiday company in June 
2007. The price of the membership was £3,595 and they made a payment of £1,195 so the 
balance due was £2,400. They also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with GE Money 
at that time for an interest free loan of £2,400. In August 2007 they entered into a purchase 
agreement for membership of the holiday club. The price of the membership was £15,669, 
less a trade-in value of £5,000, so the balance due from them was £10,699. They also 
entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with GE Money at that time for £13,099 which was 
the £10,699 due under the purchase agreement and £2,400 for refinancing their outstanding 
loan.
Mr and Mrs Ss representative made claims to GE Money under sections 75 and 140A of the 
Consumer Credit Act in February 2021 that:
the timeshare and the purchase agreement are null and void under EU Directive;
the loan agreement is unenforceable;
the timeshare was misrepresented to Mr and Mrs S; and
GE Money didnt carry out an affordability assessment on Mr and Mrs Ss ability to 
repay the loan.
It also said that Mr and Mrs S only became aware of these issues when it was advised by it 
and that clearly falls within the three years date of knowledge rule.
GE Money said that the loan account was no longer held on its systems so it determined that 
it had been closed for at least six years. It set out in detail the reasons that it didnt uphold Mr 
and Mrs Ss claim and it said that any claim that they might otherwise have had was time-
barred under the Limitation Act 1980. It apologised for the delay in its response and it offered 
to pay them £25 for any distress and inconvenience that may have been caused. They 
werent satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Ss complaint should be upheld. She 
said that their claims were outside of the time limits in the Limitation Act and were raised too 
late, so she thought that it was fair for GE Money to turn down their claims. 
Mr and Mrs Ss representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It has responded in detail and says, in summary, that the timeshare 
agreement is governed by EU Directive and that it and the credit agreement are null and 
void which makes the relationship between Mr and Mrs S and GE Money unfair. It also says 
that they wouldnt have known that they had a cause of action against GE Money until they 
consulted it in 2020  so the complaint was made within three years of their date of 
knowledge and isnt time-barred.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr and Mrs Ss complaint is that GE Money turned down their Consumer Credit Act 
claims and I accept that they referred their complaint to our service within six years of 
that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to their 
claims;
Mr and Mrs Ss claims are under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that, but 
Im considering whether or not GE Moneys response to those claims was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr and Mrs Ss claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented to 
them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them - 
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, GE Money would be expected to 
consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time limits set out in 
the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and 
to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr and Mrs S could have made a claim to the holiday company or GE 
Money about the misrepresentations that they say induced them into buying the trail 
membership and the timeshare when they entered into the agreements in June and 
August 2007 as that was when they say that they entered into agreements based on 
the misrepresentations of the holiday company and suffered a loss as they entered 
into the loan agreements with GE Money;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the holiday company or GE Money  
but they didnt make a claim against GE Money until February 2021, more than 
thirteen years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act 
so I consider that their claim is now time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Ss representative says that Mr and Ms C only became aware that they 
could make a claim to GE Money after they sought advice from it in 2020  but when they had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist them for the purposes of the 
Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are 
extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of 
action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr and 
Mrs Ss claims;
Mr and Mrs Ss representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr 
and Mrs S and GE Money and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
the loan agreement for £2,400 that Mr and Mrs S entered into in June 2007 was for 
twelve months and the loan agreement that they entered into in August 2007 shows 
a loan of £2,400 being refinanced  so I consider it to be reasonable to conclude that 
the June 2007 loan ended in August 2007;
GE Money says that the account for the loan that was entered into in August 2007 is 
no longer held on its systems and that it has determined that it has been closed for at 
least 6 years and that the latest that it could have been open was February 2015  
neither Mr and Mrs S nor their representative has provided any evidence to show that 
the loan continued after February 2015 and I consider it to be more likely than not 
that their section 140A claim was made outside of the time limits set out in the 
Limitation Act and is now time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Ss representative says that the trial membership agreement and the 
purchase agreement are null and void under European law  but Im not persuaded 
that the agreements were illegal at the time that they were entered into and I dont 
consider that Mr and Mrs S would have had three years from when they were 
advised by their representative that they had a cause of action to make a claim 
against GE Money - I consider that any claim about the legality of the agreements 
would now also be time-barred;
their representative also says that the loan agreements are null and void - but Im not 
persuaded that the loan agreements were illegal at the time that they were entered 
into and I consider that any claim about the legality of the loan agreements would 
now also be time-barred;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence in these circumstances to show that 
theres been a breach of law or regulation by the holiday company for which GE 
Money would be liable;
Mr and Mrs Ss representative has said that GE Money should have told them 
about any commission that it paid to the holiday company for arranging the loans  
but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, 
was paid by GE Money to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid 
it tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that GE Money 
wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under 
any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that GE Money should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr and 
Mrs S risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr and Mrs Ss representative says that GE Money didnt carry out affordability 
assessments on Mr and Mrs Ss ability to repay the loans  but Ive seen no evidence 
to show that the loans werent unaffordable for them and Ive seen no evidence to 
show that they complained to GE Money about the affordability of the loans or asked 
it for any information about the affordability assessments before February 2021  as 
the loans were made to them in 2007 and ended before February 2015, I consider it 
to be more likely than not that any complaint about the affordability of the loans would 
now be time-barred; 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs S were 
unduly pressured into entering into the trial membership agreement, the purchase 
agreement or the loan agreements or that the holiday company used unacceptable 
commercial practices against them  they didnt complain to GE Money about those 
issues until February 2021  more than thirteen years after they entered into the 
agreements and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have 
complained to GE Money about any such issues before then;
GE Money issued a substantive response to Mr and Mrs Ss claims in June 2021  it 
apologised for its delay in responding to their claims and offered them £25 
compensation which I consider to have been fair and reasonable  and I consider 
that it was fair and reasonable for it to say that any claim that they might otherwise 
have had was time-barred under the Limitation Act; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs S for the issues that theyve had with their timeshare 
and the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require GE Money to refund to them any 
of the money that they paid under the loan agreements, to pay them any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ss complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision before 26 October 2022.
