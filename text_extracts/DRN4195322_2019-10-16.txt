K821x#15complaint
Mr and Mrs M complain  that Barclays Bank  UK PLC gave them wrong  information  about 
whether overpayments and/or part redemptions they made to their mortgage account could 
be withdrawn.
background
Mr and Mrs M say they were told by Barclays in 2010 and 2011  that any overpayments  they 
made into their mortgage account could be refunded. They made  several lump sum 
payments.
They were  later told they couldnt  withdraw  the overpayments. Instead, Barclays  said they 
could use their mortgage reserve facility. This had a higher  interest rate than the mortgage  
account. Mr and Mrs M ask that Barclays refunds the additional  interest theyve paid  which 
they calculate as about £30,000. Theyd also like to be able to withdraw £270,000 from their 
mortgage account.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld, saying:
Barclays said that on 22 March  2011  it gave Mrs M incorrect information.  It told her she 
could ask for overpayments to be refunded  within the mortgage year.  It was Barclays  
policy at the time to allow refunds of overpayments (being  extra  payments of up to three 
times the contractual monthly payment) within the mortgage year. However, this wasnt 
correctly explained  to Mrs M.
Mr and Mrs M made payments  of about  £300,000  before  22 March 2011.  Barclays 
records didnt suggest they were given incorrect information about  being able to 
withdraw the payments before 22 March 2011.
Mr and Mrs M made payments  of about  £19,000 after 22 March  2011. Mr and Mrs M 
should be put into the position that would  have been in if theyd been able to withdraw  
these funds, as theyd been  led to believe they could. That is, Barclays should refund the 
difference between  the interest  Mr and Mrs M paid by borrowing  from the mortgage  
reserve account as compared to what theyd  have paid if theyd withdrawn this amount 
from the mortgage account, plus 8% interest.
Barclays should increase its offer of £200 compensation for the upset caused to £250.
Barclays said it agreed in principle. It said it could refund the two payments made in June 
2011. It said it would need more information  about what dates to use for the credits/debits 
from the mortgage current account.
Mr and Mrs M didnt  agree. Mrs M said shed been given incorrect information  on calls 
before March 2011. Mr M said the compensation should take into account the opportunity  
cost to them of not being  able to borrow at the mortgage rate. He said they missed the 
opportunity to invest in property. And when they did borrow using the mortgage current  
account their returns were diminished  by the high interest rate. Mr and Mrs M said the 
adjudicators recommendation didnt adequately compensate them for their effort and 
financial loss.
Ref: DRN41953222my provisional decision
I sent a provisional  decision  to the parties. In it, I set out my provisional  findings on the 
merits of this complaint.  I also set out how I thought Barclays should calculate  the redress.
Mr and Mrs M didnt  comment  on my provisional decision. Barclays  sent calculations,  as Id 
requested, but didnt  otherwise comment. In the circumstances, I dont see any reason to 
change from my provisional findings   which were substantially the same as the findings set 
out below. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances.
what happened?
Mr and Mrs M took out a flexible mortgage with Barclays in 2008. Barclays  provided a copy  
of the mortgage  offer.  They also opened a mortgage  current account which allowed them  to 
use the mortgage reserve facility.
In early 2011 Mr and Mrs M made lump sum payments into their mortgage account.  Barclays 
says its policy in 2011 was that overpayments could be refunded in certain circumstances. It 
defined overpayments  as payments in addition to the contractual monthly  payment (CMP) of 
up to three  times the CMP. These overpayments could be withdrawn within  the mortgage 
year. Any payments in excess of three times  the CMP would be treated  as part redemptions.  
Part redemptions were not refundable.
Barclays says it gave  Mrs M incorrect information on 22 March 2011.  It wasnt  clear about  
the circumstances in which additional  payments could be refunded  from the mortgage 
account.
Mr and Mrs M made two lump sum payments, totalling about £19,000, in June 2011.
Barclays gave Mrs M correct information  in September  2011.
were Mr and Mrs M given  incorrect  information before March 2011?
Due to the time that has passed,  the available information is limited. Barclays no longer has 
recordings of phone  calls from 2010 and 2011.
When Mrs M raised a complaint in 2012 she asked  Barclays to listen  to all her calls between 
December 2010  and September 2011. Barclays says it listened to the calls. In its final 
response to Mrs Ms complaint, in April 2012, it said Mrs M wasnt  given correct  information 
during the call on 22 March 2011.  Its notes of the call on 22 March 2011 say Mrs M was 
informed overpayments can be refunded back  within mortgage year.
Ref: DRN41953223Barclays final response letter of April 2012  doesnt say Mrs M was given incorrect 
information during  other calls. Barclays notes of the earlier  calls dont refer to any discussion 
about overpayments or part redemptions being refundable.
So, while Mrs M says she was given  incorrect information before  March 2011, the available 
evidence doesnt  support  this.
what was the effect of Barclays error?
Mr and Mrs M made two payments totalling  about  £19,000 into the mortgage account in 
June 2011. From what Mr and Mrs M have said, they wouldnt have  made these additional 
payments if theyd known  they couldnt later withdraw the money.  As Barclays  wouldnt 
refund the money from the mortgage  account, they say they had to use the mortgage 
reserve facility and incur  a higher interest  rate.
I think its right that Barclays puts Mr and Mrs M into the position they would have been in 
but for its error. I think this means:
1.Mr and Mrs M wouldnt have made the two additional payments  into the mortgage 
account in June 2011. Barclays should  re-work the mortgage  account to reflect this and 
the contractual monthly payments that would have  been  made  on the higher balance.
The actual monthly payments  made  by Mr and Mrs M to their mortgage account were  
lower than the contractual monthly payments that would have been due if they hadnt 
made the additional payments. So, after the mortgage account  is reworked, there  will be 
a shortfall on the account. The overpayments to be refunded calculated in 2. below 
should first be applied to the mortgage  account  to cover the shortfall. Mr and Mrs M 
should note that their future contractual monthly payments will likely increase.
2.Mr and Mrs M first used the mortgage  reserve facility  on 30 November  2012,  withdrawing 
£20,000. If they hadnt made the additional payments, Mr and Mrs M would have 
borrowed £19,320.39 less. Barclays should  rework the mortgage current account  to 
reflect this and the interest and payments that would have been applied to the lower 
debit balance.
The actual payments made by Mr and Mrs M were higher than if theyd withdrawn 
£19,320.39 less from the mortgage reserve on 30 November 2012.  The difference 
should first be applied to cover the shortfall on the mortgage account. After the shortfall 
is covered, any remaining  amount should be paid to Mr and Mrs M with interest at 8% 
simple from the date of the first additional  payment made in June 2011 to the date of the 
refund.*
3.Mr and Mrs M were  without the use of the money from (a) the date of the additional 
payments to the mortgage account  in June 2011 to 30 November 2012; and (b) from 25 
January 2018  (when they substantially  repaid  the overdraft on the mortgage current  
account) to the date Barclays refunds the additional payments.
Mr and Mrs M intended to use the money so I dont think theyd have put it into a fixed 
term account in 2011.  Its likely they would  have put the money on deposit.  Unless 
Mr and Mrs M provide evidence they would have received a better rate, I think  Barclays  
should pay interest at the Bank  of Englands base rate plus 1% for the periods  described 
in (a) and (b).*
Ref: DRN41953224I asked Barclays to provide calculations to help Mr and Mrs M see what effect the refunds 
will have before deciding  whether to go ahead.  Barclays provided  calculations up to the end 
of August  2019.  Ive attached tables which summarise the calculations  at the end of this 
decision and Barclays has said the full calculations can be sent to Mr and Mrs M if theyd like 
to see them.  I should make it clear that the calculations are for guidance  the actual 
calculations will be as at the refund  date using the balances at that time. 
In summary,  Barclays says it will refund  interest applied to the mortgage reserve  account  of 
about £5,341. It will apply about £3,613 of this to Mr and Mrs Ms mortgage  account, leaving 
a payment of about £1,728 due to Mr and Mrs M. Barclays will add interest, which  it 
calculates as about £920 (before any tax is deducted)*.
Barclays will also refund  the two payments totalling  £19,320.39. It calculated the interest 
under my item 3. above as about  £950  (before any tax is deducted)*.
Id remind Mr and Mrs M to take into account  that the refund will mean the balance  of their 
mortgage account will increase. This could result in an increase in their contractual monthly 
payments and an increase in the amount  of interest theyll  pay over the remaining term of 
their mortgage. 
Barclays agreed to pay £250 compensation for the upset and trouble caused to Mr and 
Mrs M. It also offered £30 for the cost of their calls.  I think this is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances.
*If HM Revenue & Customs requires Barclays to take off tax from this interest, it must give 
Mr and Mrs M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if they ask for one. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order Barclays Bank UK Plc to:
pay £280 to Mr and Mrs M (if it hasnt already done so);
if Mr and Mrs M confirm they want to go ahead, make the adjustments to their accounts  
and make the payments as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs M to 
accept or reject my decision  before  16 November  2019.

Ref: DRN41953225example calculations  for guidance
Barclays provided calculations to show how the mortgage account might look if the part 
redemptions of £9,708.74 and £9,611 hadnt  been made in 2011. It provided  calculations to 
show how the mortgage reserve account might  look if £19,320.39  hadnt been  withdrawn in 
2012. These are for guidance  and will be different from the final calculations required by my 
decision. Ive summarised  the calculations below.
