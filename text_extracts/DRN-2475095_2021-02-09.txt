The complaint
Mr F complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA provided poor service when he asked it 
to process a refund under its Buyer Protection Scheme.
What happened
Mr F had a PayPal account. In November 2019 he says he purchased two items on the 
internet. He used his PayPal account to pay for the items. Mr F says both items were the 
same. When he opened the first item, he realised it was not as described by the seller and it 
wasnt suitable for his purposes. He didnt open the second item. He contacted the seller 
about this. The seller refused his request to return the items.
Mr F contacted PayPal and raised a dispute in December 2019. He asked for a refund of the 
value of the unopened item which was £7. 
Mr F says he noticed PayPal hadnt recorded his complaint properly. It had listed the dispute 
as being a damaged/faulty item and he had to contact it to get this changed. He says he 
heard nothing further and had to contact PayPal again.
PayPal then wrote to him and told him he should return the item to the seller and send it 
tracking information to confirm hed done this. But it provided an address for the seller which 
was in a foreign language. Mr F was concerned about this. He says he contacted PayPal 
again by telephone. He says he was advised not to return the item to the address since it 
was in a foreign language and it would be risky sending an item to this address at Christmas. 
He says he was also told that PayPal was requesting the seller to provide a UK address for 
the item to be returned to.
Mr F says he then received a decision from PayPal which said that it was denying his claim 
because he hadnt returned the item or provided tracking information as requested by it. Mr 
F says he phoned PayPal again and complained. He says he was told the dispute was 
closed incorrectly and as a gesture of goodwill £10 would be credited to his account. 
Mr F says he was also told to make a formal written complaint. He says the email address 
he was given did not exist. He then tried to complain through his account and the Pay Pal 
website, but the form wasnt long enough to document his complaint. He tried to phone 
PayPal but there were lengthy waiting times. So, he complained to our service.
Our service contacted PayPal about the complaint. PayPal issued a final response letter to 
Mr F on 8 October 2020. It said it had correctly followed its procedures as set out in the 
buyer protection clauses of its agreement. It said Mr F hadnt provided it with evidence that 
hed returned the item and for that reason it hadnt given him the refund. It said it 
acknowledged that Mr F may not be familiar with the terms of the agreement. So, it agreed 
as an exceptional gesture to refund the full amount of the transaction - £14. It credited his 
PayPal account with this amount.
Mr F wasnt satisfied with this response. He said his complaint was about the service hed 
received. So, he asked our service to investigate his complaint further.
Our investigator looked into his complaint. She said PayPal hadnt provided any call 
recordings. It said it had no records of the calls Mr F had referred to although it accepted this 
didnt mean he hadnt made the calls. In these circumstances she said she had to say what 
she thought was more likely to have happened. 
On balance, she thought Mr F had made the calls. And, although PayPal had refunded £14 
to him and paid him £10 as a gesture of goodwill, that didnt take into account the upset and 
frustration Mr F had experienced when his claim had been denied. So, she thought PayPal 
should pay him an additional £40 by way of compensation.
PayPal didnt agree. It said Mr F had already been given adequate compensation for what 
had happened. 
Because PayPal didnt agree the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal hasnt been able to provide call recordings in this case. It says it has no record of 
any calls between it and Mr F in the period between November 2019 and February 2020. But 
it has accepted that this doesnt mean Mr F didnt contact it by phone. 
Mr F says he did contact PayPal by phone during this period. He says he contacted PayPal 
because he didnt think it had correctly recorded the reason why he was seeking a refund. 
He says the reason was incorrectly recorded as item faulty whereas the correct reason was 
item not as described. And, he says he contacted PayPal on several occasions after that, 
as follows:
to tell it hed not got a response to his claim;
to tell it that it had responded but that the address he was asked to return the item to 
was in a foreign language; and
to complain that his claim had been denied  even though he says hed been told not 
to return the item to a foreign address.
Ive thought about what Mr F has said. I havent seen any evidence to support what Mr F has 
said about the reason for the claim being incorrectly recorded. In any case, I dont think that, 
even if it had been incorrectly recorded, it wouldve had any bearing on what subsequently 
happened. 
Ive then considered what Mr F has told us about his subsequent contact with PayPal. Even 
though theres no call recordings, PayPal has provided us with a list of dates and times when 
it contacted either Mr F or the seller in relation to this dispute.
I can see that the case was first registered on 22 November 2019 and PayPal said it was 
going to ask the seller for additional information. It told Mr F that the seller had until 2 
December to respond to its request. The next time PayPal wrote to Mr F was 18 December 
2019. At that time, it provided him with an address to return the item to.
So, I think, based on the balance of probabilities it is likely that Mr F contacted PayPal after 2 
December and before 18 December when he hadnt heard anything from it. Ive also looked 
at the correspondence dated 18 December. It is clear that Mr F was asked to return the item to a foreign address and the address was also provided in a foreign language. He was told 
he had to provide evidence of postage (proof of tracking) to PayPal by 28 December 2019.
I can understand why Mr F wouldve been concerned about this. He says hed purchased the 
item from what he believed to be an address in the UK. So, I think it is likely he contacted 
PayPal about this.
PayPal says that even if he did contact it about this address, he wouldnt have been told not 
to post the item back because it was too risky to post items at Christmas. I havent been 
able to listen to any recording of this call. But, on balance, Im persuaded that the call was 
made and I think Mr F wouldve asked PayPal to provide him with an alternative UK address 
to return the item to.
From looking at the sequence of events it appears that PayPal then sent two further 
messages to Mr F asking him to provide the following documentation. But, neither of these 
messages set out what that documentation was. So, its not clear whether PayPal had 
changed the additional information it required, following the call with Mr F. But, in any case 
these messages didnt make clear to Mr F what he needed to provide. And, he says he 
believed at this time that PayPal was going to provide him with a UK address to return the 
items to.
Mr F then got a message from PayPal on 21 January 2020 to say that because he hadnt 
provided valid proof of tracking, it was denying his claim.
Mr F says he phoned PayPal again and it accepted that he shouldnt have been expected to 
return the item to a foreign address. And, he says he was offered £10 as a gesture of 
goodwill and told to escalate his complaint. But he says he was given incorrect information 
about how to do this. So, he says he referred his complaint to our service.
I can see that PayPal doesnt accept it did anything wrong. It says it followed its procedures 
and Mr F shouldve returned the item to the address it had specified.
Having thought about what PayPal has said here, I dont think it was fair or reasonable to 
expect Mr F to return an item to a foreign address after he says hed contacted it to query 
this. As Ive said above, I think Mr F did contact PayPal about this and Im persuaded on 
balance it did tell him not to return the item to the address it had provided. I also think the 
subsequent messages he got didnt make clear what documentation he was required to 
send to progress his claim.
Although PayPal has now provided Mr F with a full refund I dont think its done enough to 
put things right here. Mr F has had to spend time contacting PayPal about this matter and 
there was a lengthy delay before he eventually got the refund. 
PayPal has given him £10 as a gesture of goodwill and has refunded an additional £7 more 
than what he requested. But I dont think thats enough. I agree with our investigator that Mr 
F has experienced distress and inconvenience as a result of what happened. And I think its 
fair and reasonable to require it to pay him an additional £40 for what happened.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA
I now require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to:Pay Mr F an additional £40 by way of compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience he experienced as a result of what happened.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 March 2021.
