Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Ss complaint  and thought that loans  three to eight shouldnt  
have been given. Miss S had cancelled loans  three,  four, six, seven and eight and didnt pay 
any interest on these loans. So a refund was due only in connection  with loan five.
It wasnt clear  whether loans seven  and eight were showing on Miss Ss credit  file, so the 
adjudicator said any record of those loans should  be removed.
Payday agreed  with the adjudicators conclusions in connection with loan five. It said it would 
refund interest  and charges  for that loan, and remove the record  of it from Miss Ss credit 
file. 
Miss S didnt agree with the adjudicators conclusions, so the complaint has been passed to 
me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Miss S says payday  loans have had a huge impact on her finances, and that she was often 
borrowing from one lender to pay another. She says this created considerable stress and 
anxiety. With that in mind, she doesnt think the refund  offered by Payday is fair.
Ref: DRN07988582I can understand why Miss S might  take that view. But our approach  means we look at the 
circumstances in which each loan was provided, and consider whether or not the lender did 
everything it should have when assessing  the loan applications. If there were any 
assessment failings, we look at whether  this resulted in the lender agreeing to lend when it 
should reasonably have  known that the customer would  find it difficult to repay. 
We also consider whether  there  came  a point in the lending  relationship where the pattern of 
lending itself showed that further credit was likely  to have been unsustainable. 
If it wasnt appropriate for the lender  to lend, to put things  right we ask it to refund interest 
and charges paid on the loan or loans that shouldnt  have been provided.  
The lender  usually also has to pay interest on the refund,  and remove any adverse 
information about the loan or loans  that shouldnt have been  given  from the customers  credit 
file. 
We keep in mind that the customer had use of the money that the lender loaned.  So unless 
there are very specific reasons why a refund should be made, we dont usually ask the 
lender to refund the original loan amount.
Payday accepts that it shouldnt have given Miss S loans three  to eight. As all but one of 
those loans were cancelled by Miss S, a refund of charges and interest  is due only in 
connection with loan five.
Payday has also agreed to remove any adverse  information in connection with loan five. 
I think thats fair and reasonable,  so I wont asking Payday to make  any further refunds in 
connection with loans three  to eight.
But Im satisfied that Payday should  also remove any information about loans seven and 
eight from Miss Ss credit file.
Ive thought about whether it was fair and reasonable for Payday to provide loans one and 
two to Miss S. 
The Office  of Fair Trading  (OFT) was the regulator at the time when Miss S borrowed loans 
one and two. Its guidance  says that Payday needed to make  a reasonable assessment of 
whether she could afford to meet the repayments for her loans  in a sustainable manner. This 
means being able to meet her repayments  out of her normal income without having to go 
without or borrow further.
The regulations arent  prescriptive  about what checks Payday needed to carry out. But the 
checks needed to be proportionate to the circumstances. In general, Id expect a lender to 
require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the consumer of not being able to 
repay the credit in a sustainable  way. 
Ref: DRN07988583So, for example,  Id expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying  out more detailed 
checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
So, as our adjudicator  did, Ive first thought about  whether  or not the checks Payday carried  
out for loans  one and two were proportionate  and, if not, what proportionate checks might  
have shown. 
Having looked  carefully at all of the evidence, I havent been able to safely conclude  that  
Payday carried out reasonable  and proportionate  checks when Miss S applied to it for loans 
one and two. 
Keeping in mind  Miss Ss declared income  of £1,300  and the amounts she was borrowing 
(£150 and £230), I think it wouldve been reasonable for Payday to consider  not only her 
income, but also her normal monthly  living costs and regular financial commitments.  Im not 
sure that Payday  did that.
So Ive given  careful consideration to the bank statements Miss S has provided, particularly 
around the time that loans  one and two were provided in order to come to a conclusion 
about what Payday  might  have found  out about  her usual  living  costs, had it looked  into 
those in more  detail 
Having done so, Im not persuaded that the evidence from those statements meant it 
wouldve been reasonable for Payday to conclude that Miss S wouldnt be able to 
sustainably repay  her loans. I appreciate that Miss S was borrowing from other short  term 
lenders at the time but I dont think Payday would have found  out the extent of her 
dependence this early on in their lending relationship.
That means I am not upholding Miss Ss complaint in connection  with loans one and two. I 
appreciate that this will be disappointing  for her, but I hope my explanation makes it clear  
why Ive reached this conclusion.
what Payday should do to put things right
Payday was irresponsible to have agreed  loans three to eight for Miss S. Loans  three,  four, 
six, seven and eight  were cancelled by Miss S. In order  to put Miss S back in the position  
she would  have been in, had it not agreed to the loans, Payday should: 
-refund all interest  and charges (including  late fees and default interest charges) Miss S 
paid for loan five;
-pay interest on that refund at 8% simple* per year from the dates  of payment to the 
dates of settlement;
-remove all information about loans seven and eight from Miss Ss credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  Payday  to take off tax from this interest. Payday must give Miss S 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN07988584my final decision
I uphold Miss Ss complaint for the reasons given above and require  MEM Consumer 
Finance Limited  (trading  as PaydayUK) to put things right as Ive set out. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 August 2019.
