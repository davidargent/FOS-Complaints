Mr M has said he should not have been given the loans and better  checks should have been 
done. Hes told us he was spending significant amounts on gambling and was in a huge 
amount of debt. Mr Lender has said the appropriate  checks were  completed with every new 
application. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ms complaint in part and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Mr Lender  disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure
Mr M could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account  a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN43028192the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Mr M hasnt  disagreed with our adjudicators  opinion on loans 1 to 3 so I wont  be looking at 
these any further  as there is no ongoing  disagreement about  them.  But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Mr Ms other lending. 
But by the time Mr M asked for loans  4 and 5, I think Mr Lender should have done  more than 
relying on the information he was providing  about  his finances  it should have carried out a 
full financial review. This was Mr Ms fourth loan in quick succession  and in less than a year. 
And hed borrowed  relatively high amounts. And whilst the loans were intended to be repaid 
over a number of months Mr M had repaid loan the month after taking which  meant hed 
repaid much  more than Mr Lender  recorded his disposable income to be. 
If Mr Lender had done proportionate checks, it would have seen that Mr M had several  short-
term loans with other providers as well as having credit cards  and overdrafts.  He was also 
spending a significant amount on gambling.  So I think its likely Mr M couldnt sustainably  
repay loans  4 and 5 and Mr Lender shouldnt have approved them.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders  lending history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender  should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Mr Lender should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 
6. I say this because:
Ref: DRN43028193At this point Mr Lender  ought  to have realised  Mr M was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr M had borrowed on six occasions in 15 months and whilst the 
amounts fluctuated, they didnt significantly decrease over this period and for the rest 
of the borrowing relationship with Mr Lender.  So Mr Lender ought to have realised it 
was more likely than not Mr M was having  to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ms indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ms first loan was for £500 and loan 6 was for £700. At this point Mr Lender ought 
to have known  that Mr M was not likely borrowing  to meet a temporary shortfall  in 
their income but to meet an ongoing need.  
Up to loan 6 and going forward Mr M was provided with a new loan within  a short  
time of settling a previous one. 
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Mr Lender. Loan  8 was 
taken out two years and seven months after Mr M first borrowed from Mr Lender.
Mr M had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to Mr Lender 
over an extended period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Mr Lender continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because these loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time. The number  of loans and the length of time over which  Mr M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 and 5 and loans 6 to 8 and Mr Lender  should 
put things right.
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loan 4 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Ms credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 8 should be removed from     
Mr Ms credit file.
   
If Mr M still owes Mr Lender any of the principal balance he borrowed on his final loan         
Mr Lender should  remove  all the interest and charges applied  to the outstanding balance.    
Mr Lender should  then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Mr M went to towards 
the principal. But importantly, Mr Lender needs to make sure that Mr M doesnt  repay  more  
than the principal amount borrowed. 
Ref: DRN43028194If after doing this Mr M hasnt repaid the principal  she borrowed Mr Lender  can deduct this 
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr M has already paid enough  to repay  the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple interest from the 
date of payment  to the date of settlement
And if Mr Lender no longer owns this debt, and it wants  to make a deduction due to the 
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr M.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender  
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. PDL Finance Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 February  2020.
