The complaint
Mrs E complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) incorrectly credited her 
payment to the wrong account and needs to compensate her for the loss of use of her funds.
What happened
Mrs E made a payment from her account with another bank to a NatWest Individual Savings 
Account (ISA) on 19 December 2022, but said it was credited, against her instructions, to 
another of her NatWest accounts. She said NatWests terms and conditions dont state it will 
do this and it should have returned the payment to the sending bank if it couldnt be credited 
to her ISA as it would have to have done if she hadnt held another account with NatWest.   
Mrs E said when the payment wasnt credited to the correct account, she was worried the 
funds had been lost. She said she had to spend a lot of time with NatWest to trace the funds 
calling them on 2 and 3 January 2023. She said she couldnt proceed with her intended use 
of her funds, and she complained to the bank.
NatWest responded saying it hadnt made an error as its process and policy is to apply funds 
to the customers alternate account when these cannot be applied to an ISA for any reason. 
NatWest explained that it did this as Mrs E had already used the ISA allowance. NatWest 
wrote to Mrs E advising her about the funds transfer and allowance limit for her ISA account. 
Mrs E was dissatisfied with NatWests response and referred her complaint to our service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. He said due to a likely oversight 
by Mrs E, the funds couldnt be credited to the ISA and its policy and process is to credit the 
funds to another of the customers accounts. He said NatWest followed its business process, 
which we dont comment on, and had acted reasonably. 
Mrs E disagreed with the investigator and requested an ombudsman review her complaint. 
She wanted to see where NatWests policy was set out. She said its clearly stated in the 
terms that, if you pay more than the limit then any excess money will be returned to you. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs E wants to know why NatWest didnt return the payment to the originating bank when it 
couldnt be credited to her ISA, and where within NatWests terms and conditions it states it 
will put the funds into another of her accounts if her instructions cant be followed.  
I can see that the payment Mrs E was attempting to make to her ISA would have taken her 
above the permissible subscription limit for the tax year and so NatWest was correct not to 
apply it. NatWest has explained the different treatment of this payment from Mrs Es 
previous payments which were ISA transfers completed as transactions requested by 
NatWest on her behalf.
Since Mrs Es payment was beyond her ISA limit and wasnt an ISA transfer request, 
NatWest needed to reallocate the funds. Mrs E said this should have been back to her 
account with another bank. NatWests terms and conditions state, If you pay in more than 
the limit, any excess money will be returned to you. Returned to you refers to the customer 
and NatWest returned the funds to Mrs E by transferring the sum to another of her accounts. 
If the terms had stated that the funds would be returned to the sending bank, then I think Mrs 
E would be correct to say the process hadnt been followed. 
NatWest says its policy in this situation is to refund the customer by crediting any alternative 
account the customer holds with it, or if not, to send the customer funds by cheque. I have 
seen the text of this process that NatWest has followed. 
Banks have internal processes and policies for various transactions, including reallocating 
payments, and we wouldnt expect all of these to be in the terms and conditions. Unless we 
consider the process to provide an unfair outcome for a customer, we wouldnt comment on 
them. As the investigator has said, we dont regulate the banks, and their internal processes, 
or how they operate generally. Thats the role of the Financial Conduct Authority.
I sympathise with Mrs E for exceeding her ISA allowance and then not noticing the funds 
had been credited to another of her NatWest accounts. Unfortunately NatWest doesnt have 
recordings of the calls with Mrs E on 2 and 3 January 2023 and so I cant see what she was 
told about the payment. However, its clear Mrs E didnt realise the payment had gone to 
another of her accounts as she raised a complaint and didnt move the funds until the 
following month. Having said this NatWest wrote to Mrs E on 13 January 2023 and explained 
in detail how the payment had been handled and the account it had been credited to. 
I can understand Mrs Es feeling of uncertainty about what had happened to her payment, 
but I dont think there was a loss of any significance during this period. I think NatWests 
policy in crediting her payment to another of her accounts with the bank is logical and 
reasonable and is not something with which our service would interfere. I think NatWest has 
treated her fairly in respect of its handling of her payment and so I dont require it to take any 
action in respect of this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given above it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 September 2023.
