The complaint
Mr A complains that NewDay Ltd, trading as marbles (NewDay), placed a default on his 
credit card account after it told him it wouldnt.  Mr A is also unhappy with NewDays 
treatment of him because of his health and financial issues. 
What happened
Mr A missed two payments on his credit card and was sent a first default notice in December 
2018. 
Between missing the first payment and the first default notice, NewDay wrote to Mr A and 
called him several times to establish why payments had not been received. Mr A told 
NewDay he had:
experienced a reduction in income 
had been in hospital because of a heart condition 
was behind with payments to other creditors and 
had recently been bereaved. 
 
NewDay also asked Mr A on a number of occasions if he would like to discuss repayment 
options but Mr A declined.  Mr A also said that he was unhappy with NewDay phoning him 
about his account. 
On 10 January 2019, Mr A contacted NewDay and agreed a repayment plan for a minimum 
of £1.00 a month. The first payment was never received. The account was then terminated, 
transferred to NewDays debt recovery agent and charges and interest suspended. This 
situation remained unchanged until 1 May 2019.
On 1 May 2019, Mr A made two calls to NewDay as hed received another default notice. He 
was unhappy that his account would be placed in default in 28 days when he says hed 
previously advised NewDay of his mental health problems  it appears previous notices did 
not to give Mr A a date by which he needed to take action. Mr A said hed not opened letters 
from NewDay since January 2019 as hed been in and out of hospital and coming to terms 
with the death of a friend. He said he wanted to have the default dealt with that day, 
however, there was no-one available at NewDay to take this forward. 
Mr A raised a complaint during the first call on 1 May 2019 about the default notice and 
NewDays management of his account. During the second call, the agent confirmed to Mr A 
that the default would not be applied and that shed email the customer care team 
accordingly. The following day, the customer care team unsuccessfully tried to call Mr A and 
sent him a letter. 
On 13 May 2019, Mr A received a final response letter from NewDay. It said details of 
default notices had to be shared with credit reference agencies and that Mr As account had 
been managed in line with its processes for accounts in arrears. Mr A was told to contact 
NewDay customer services if he wanted assistance. On 11 June 2019, Mr A complained to NewDay that the default had been registered and he 
had missed out on a house because of it. NewDay rejected this complaint. It accepted Mr A 
was given incorrect information as Mr A was told the default would not be applied, but that 
the default should remain to accurately reflect Mr As payment history. It said that placing a 
vulnerable block on Mr As account would not have stopped the default being registered. Mr 
A was offered £150 compensation for the incorrect information.  Mr A was unhappy with this 
and brought the case to us.
Our investigator concluded that:
NewDay dealt with Mr A positively and sympathetically given his financial difficulties
Mr As application for a mortgage being declined was not NewDays fault as many 
factors are taken into account when a provider decides whether to lend.  
The default recorded on Mr As file was fair given the level of arrears on the account
£150 is a reasonable offer of compensation.
 
Mr A asked for his complaint to be referred for an Ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Firstly, I would like to express my sympathy to Mr A as this has undoubtedly been a difficult 
time for him.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. I dont think NewDay needs to do 
anything more than it has done already in respect of Mr As complaint. I appreciate this is not 
the outcome Mr A was hoping for, so I have set out my reasons for my decision below.  
I am satisfied that NewDay dealt with Mr A positively and sympathetically before Mr A first 
informed NewDay of his mental health problems on 1 May 2019. NewDay contacted Mr A 
soon after the first payment was missed and again on a number of other occasions over 
following months to discuss how they could help him. NewDay stopped phoning Mr A after 
he expressed his unhappiness about receiving calls from it and agreed a reasonable 
payment plan with Mr A. NewDay also did not apply further interest or charges to the 
account after January 2019  all of which shows a sympathetic approach to Mr As situation. 
I think NewDay also gave Mr A as much time as it could before registering the default. A 
default should be registered between three and six months of a consumer falling behind on 
payments. Mr A was given around six months before the default was registered, so I think 
NewDay has done what Id expect of it here. 
Even after taking into account Mr As financial and mental health problems, NewDay would 
still have been entitled to notify credit reference agencies of the conduct of the account. Mr A 
was also unhappy NewDay sent him default notices after hed told it about his mental health 
issues. It appears Mr A first told NewDay of about these problems on 1 May 2019 and the 
default notices were sent before this date, so I dont think NewDay did anything wrong in 
sending the default notices to Mr A.  
I am satisfied that  on balance  the refusal of Mr As housing application was unlikely to be 
because of the default NewDay placed on his file. Many factors are taken into account by 
landlords and mortgage providers when deciding whether to enter into an arrangement with 
a consumer.  From what Mr A had told NewDay previously about his situation, Mr A had 
experienced financial difficulties before making his application, which would most likely have 
had an impact on the refusal. So I dont think that Mr A should be awarded further compensation on these grounds alone.
But NewDay accepts it made a mistake here and that it gave Mr A the wrong advice when 
he called about the default. But that doesnt automatically mean itd be fair for me to tell 
NewDay that it should remove the default. Instead, we look to put a customer in the position 
they would be in were a mistake not made. Here, that wouldve been that he was advised 
correctly that he needed to pay off what was outstanding to avoid the default.
So Ive considered whether Mr A could have avoided the default had he been given correct 
information by NewDay. I asked NewDay what Mr A could have done to avoid a default 
being placed on his file had he been given correct information. NewDay responded that Mr A 
would have had to pay to a total of £297.27 to bring the account back up to date. NewDay 
also said that if Mr A was unable to pay this amount, it may have agreed to reduced 
payments, but because of the level of arrears, the default would still have been applied to Mr 
As file. 
Ive considered whether Mr A would have been able pay the outstanding £297.27.  Mr A 
provided copies of his payslips from around the time he called NewDay in May 2019, but 
says he is unable to provide bank statements as hes since changed banks. So I am unable 
to see Mr As expenditure alongside his income. That makes it difficult for me, on balance, to 
see whether he couldve paid the outstanding amount. But, given what he told NewDay 
about his financial position previously, coupled with the fact he hadnt made contractual 
payments for some time and the payments he could make were only £1 Im not satisfied 
that its likely hed have been in a position to pay the outstanding amount and so avoid the 
default. With this in mind, I am satisfied that the default should remain on Mr As credit file. 
I think NewDay could have done more to correct its mistake. NewDay called Mr A and wrote 
to him when there had been known issues in the past with these forms of communication. 
NewDay were also relying on Mr A to get in touch with it so it could correct its mistake. 
NewDay has already offered Mr A £150 compensation for the incorrect information, which I 
feel is reasonable when the correct information would have been unlikely to have prevented 
a default being registered on Mr As credit file.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
My final decision
I do not uphold Mr As complaint. NewDay Ltd should pay Mr A the £150 compensation it 
has offered him for giving him incorrect information, if it has not already done so. I do not 
instruct NewDay Ltd to do anything more than this. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 June 2020.
