The complaint
Miss F is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua loans, approved her for a credit 
account which wasnt affordable for her at that time, and also that they didnt recognise that 
she was experiencing financial difficulties during the time that she was using the credit
account or respond appropriately.
What happened
Miss F applied for a credit account with NewDay in September 2016 and was approved for a
card with a credit limit of £300. Miss F quickly took the account over the agreed credit limit
and the account was regularly over the agreed credit limit for the next nine months.
In June 2017, Miss F told NewDay that she was struggling to meet her priority bills and
NewDay put a block on her account to prevent the outstanding balancing increasing
because of this. NewDay also sent Miss F an income and expenditure questionnaire to get a
better of understanding of what Miss F could afford to pay.
In July 2017, NewDay and Miss F agreed to a temporary payment arrangement whereby
Miss F would pay £34 per month over five months in order to bring the account back under
the approved credit limit. Miss F followed this payment arrangement and when the payment
plan ended in November 2017 the account balance had been brought back under £300.
Miss F made two more payments to the account  in December 2017 and January 2018 
but no further payments. As a result, the account fell into arrears, entered NewDays
collections procedure, and was ultimately defaulted by NewDay in September 2018.
In June 2020, Miss F sent a complaint to NewDay. The complaint stated that Miss F believed
that NewDay shouldnt have approved her for a credit account because the account was
unaffordable for her at that time. The complaint also stated that Miss F believed that
NewDay hadnt taken due consideration of the financial difficulties that she had experienced
while she was using the account.
Miss F received a response from NewDay advising her that she had sent the complaint
email to the loans department rather than the credit card department and which suggested
that Miss F contact NewDay by telephone or webchat to raise her complaint. Miss F wasnt
satisfied with this response, so she referred her complaint to this service.
This service contacted NewDay and advised them of Miss Fs complaint and asked them to
respond. NewDay looked at the complaint, but they felt that credit account had been
affordable for Miss F at the time of the application, and that they had taken steps to help
Miss F when they because aware of her financial difficulties. So, they didnt uphold the
complaint.
Miss F confirmed that she would like her complaint to be reviewed by this service, so one of
our investigators looked at the complaint. They felt that the credit account had been
affordable or Miss F at the time of application.
Our investigator also felt that NewDay had acted positively and sympathetically to Miss Fs
financial difficulties when agreeing the payment plan in July 2018. But they were concerned
that NewDay hadnt contacted Miss F when the payment plan had finished to confirm
whether she was still experiencing financial difficulties. So, they partially upheld the
complaint on this basis.
NewDay didnt agree with the view put forward by our investigator, so the matter was
escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this case on 17 March 2021, as follows:
It's for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to someone, and if so, how 
much and on what terms. What we'd expect is that the credit provider carries out 
reasonable and proportionate checks as to the affordability of any credit being 
offered. And I think that NewDay has done that here. They took details of Miss Fs 
income and they checked her credit file.
I note that Miss Fs credit file at the time of the credit application did include a default
recorded in February 2015 as well as an amount of existing debt, but even taking this 
into account Im satisfied that the credit account that she was approved for, with a 
relatively small credit limit of £300, did appear affordable for her at that time.
Following the approval of the credit account in September 2016 its notable that Miss 
F quickly took the account over the agreed credit limit and that the account was 
regularly over the limit up until the time that Miss F informed NewDay that she was 
struggling financially in June 2017.
However, its also notable that on most occasions Miss F was able to make monthly
payments to bring the account back under the credit limit, and it was a feature of the 
account that the credit card couldnt be used by Miss F when she was over the credit 
limit, which meant that it was never the case during these months that the 
outstanding balance exceeded the credit limit by more than £25.
Additionally, I can see that Miss F spoke with NewDay on several occasions before 
June 2017 regarding the status of her account and the reasons why she had 
exceeded the credit limit, and I can see that NewDay reimbursed charges to Miss F 
on two occasions following these conversations. And I cant see that Miss F mentions 
anything to NewDay during these calls that should have given NewDay cause to 
think that Miss F might not be able to manage the credit account moving forwards.
But in June 2016 Miss F did inform NewDay that she was experiencing financial 
difficulties and that she was struggling to pay her priority debts. When a customer 
tells a business that they are in financial difficulty it would be expected by this service 
that the business reacts with a degree of sympathy and takes positive steps to help 
the customer through the difficult time they are facing.
And I think that NewDay did that here. They placed an immediate hold on the 
account to prevent the outstanding balance from increasing further and they sent 
Miss F an income and expenditure questionnaire to help them get a better 
understanding of Miss Fs financial situation.Miss F spoke with NewDay again in July 2017 and said that she believed that these 
financial difficulties would be temporary. And on this basis NewDay agreed an 
informal temporary payment plan that wouldnt be recorded on Miss Fs credit file and 
which involved Miss F making payments of £34 per month for five months to bring 
the balance of the account down to a reasonable level.
This gave Miss F the opportunity to return her account to a usable position without 
having a record of the payment plan on her credit file, and I consider this to be a 
positive and sympathetic response from NewDay. And it must be noted that Miss F 
made the five agreed payments without incident.
Our investigator partially upheld this complaint because they felt that NewDay should 
have contacted Miss F at the end of the payment plan to confirm whether she was 
still in financial difficulties at that time. However, I dont feel that its fair to have 
expected NewDay to have done this, and I say this because Miss F had informed 
NewDay that she expected her financial difficulties to be temporary and had agreed a 
payment plan that was itself temporary, and also because she hadnt missed any of 
the five agreed payments in the payment plan that NewDay had agreed with her.
So, given that Miss F completed the temporary payment plan without incident and 
brought the balance of the account below the credit limit, it seems reasonable to me 
that NewDay would have allowed her to use the credit account again. And if Miss F 
was still experiencing financial difficulties at that time, she could have contacted 
NewDay to advise them of this.
But I havent seen anything to confirm that Miss F did contact NewDay again. And 
after making two further payments to the account in December 2017 and January 
2018, Miss F stopped making payments. This meant that the account went into 
arrears and entered NewDays collection process, and the account was ultimately 
defaulted by NewDay in September 2018. And considering what I have outlined 
above, its difficult for me to find any reason to consider that this was inappropriate.
All of which means that its difficult for me to conclude that NewDay have acted 
unfairly or unreasonably here, and it follows that my provisional decision will be that I 
wont be upholding this complaint or asking NewDay to take any further action at this 
time.
Im aware that NewDay have offered Miss F a payment of £50 in regard to how they 
initially responded to Miss Fs complaint, but I consider that to be separate to this 
review and so it wouldnt be expected that that offer would be affected by the 
provisional decision I have reached here.
I understand that this wont be the outcome that Miss F was wanting, but I hope that 
she can understand, considering everything I have explained, why I have reached 
the provisional decision that I have.
In my provisional decision letter I have both Miss F and NewDay until 16 April 2021 to 
provide any further comments or information that they wished me to consider before moving 
to a final decision. NewDay confirmed they were in agreement with my final decision. Miss F 
did not respond.
It follows that I see no reason not to issue my final decision on the basis outlined in my 
provisional decision above, and this means that my final decision will be that I do not uphold 
this complaint.My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss F to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 May 2021.
