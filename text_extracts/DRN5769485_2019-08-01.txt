K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that Provident Personal Credit  Limited (trading as Satsuma) did not carry 
out appropriate affordability and credit checks before lending to him and that the lending 
adversely affected  his credit file.
background
Mr C had three loans from Satsuma between July 2017 and February 2018 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment* Due Repaid
1 29 Jul 2017 £500 12m £83.00 16 Aug 2018 26 Oct 2017 
Early
2 5 Dec 2017 £600 9m £133.20 1 Oct 2018 Two payments
Balance O/S
3 15 Feb 2018 £400 9m £88.80 16 Nov 2018 One payment  
Balance O/S
* Monthly  repayment  over the term of the loan
Mr C says Satsuma did insufficient  checks of his income and expenditure  and should  have 
realised from his borrowing pattern that his financial situation was getting worse.  He says the 
high interest rate prevented  him from paying priority  bills and he had to borrow  from other  
short-term lenders to make the repayments. 
Satsuma says it asked  Mr C for information about  his income and expenditure which showed 
he had disposable  income of between  £1,350  and £1,850 per month. It also looked  at his 
credit file and increased his declared  expenditure based on the information it showed. It says 
this indicated the loans were all affordable to Mr C.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. She was satisfied that 
Satsuma carried out proportionate checks. She didnt  find anything  in the available  
information, or Mr Cs borrowing pattern, that should have indicated  to Satsuma that Mr C 
may have  been  in financial difficulty.
Mr C did not agree and asked for an ombudsmans review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Loan 1
When Mr C applied for his first loan from Satsuma  he said his monthly income was £1,500 
with expenses of £150. I dont consider this unreasonable given he said he lived with his 
parents. Satsuma also checked  his credit file and adjusted his expenditure up slightly. As the 
scheduled repayment was a small proportion  of Mr Cs income, Im satisfied it did enough 
checks and would have  found the loan to be affordable. So I cant  say Satsuma shouldnt 
have approved loan 1.
Ref: DRN57694852Loan 2
Mr C repaid his first loan early and received an early settlement bonus. Six weeks  later, he 
applied for a second loan from Satsuma. This time the monthly repayments were slightly 
higher, but Mr C said his income was now £1,800 with £350 of expenditure. Again, Satsuma 
checked his credit file and, despite  increasing  the expenditure figure by over £500, it still 
found the repayments were affordable to Mr C. So I cant conclude  it was wrong to approve 
loan 2.
Loan 3
Mr C was still repaying loan 2 when he applied for his third loan. So the total repayment he 
needed to make each  month was over £220. Mr C said his income  was now £2,200, giving 
him a disposable income of £1,850 per month. This time Satsuma increased  his expenditure 
figure by £1,400, but this still made the loan affordable to Mr C.
I cant see there was anything in the information provided, or the information of which  
Satsuma should  have been  aware, which meant it would have been proportionate to start 
verifying what Mr C was saying. So, although  I accept Mr C had difficulty repaying  both loans 
2 and 3, his repayments on loan 2 were up to date when he applied for loan 3. So I dont find 
Satsuma should  have declined his third application at the time.
 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 September 2019.
