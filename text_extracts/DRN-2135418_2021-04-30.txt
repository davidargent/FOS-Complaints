The complaint
Mr M complains that PSI-Pay Limited (ecoPayz) took €19.50 from his account in dormancy 
charges. He says he wasnt notified of the charges and that ecoPayz wasnt entitled to make 
the charges.
What happened
Between 27 January and 16 October 2019, ecoPayz applied charges of €19.50 against Mr 
Ms account. It said it had charged Mr M a monthly fee of €1.50 because his account had 
been inactive for 12 months.
Mr M complained. He felt there was activity on his account because he had logged into his 
account online. On 7 October 2019 ecoPayz sent Mr M a final response letter. It said it had 
sent him an email a month before the first charge, and that it had explained the fee to him on 
7 March 2019, when he contacted ecoPayz to query it.
Mr M remained unhappy, so he brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator didnt 
uphold Mr Ms complaint. She was satisfied ecoPayz was entitled to apply the charges and 
that it had given Mr M advanced notice and had explained the position to him.
Mr M disagree. He said he didnt receive the email from ecoPayz telling him about the 
charges. And that, having sought legal advice, he thought ecoPayz had fabricated the email 
notification it had sent to our service as evidence. He said ecoPayz had stolen his money, 
and he wanted it back.
Mr M asked for an ombudsman to review the matter afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Section 17.1 of the terms and conditions of the account, that both Mr M and ecoPayz have to 
comply with, provides that Mr M is responsible for paying all applicable fees that appear 
under the fees and limits section of its website. The fees and limits section provides that an 
account maintenance fee of €1.50 per month is payable after inactivity of 12 months.
On 26 June 2017, Mr M deposited €22.34 into his account. He was charged a deposit fee of 
€0.58 and a card application fee of €1.80, leaving a balance of €19.96. After that date, Mr M 
didnt make any further payments on his account, or receive any further funds into his 
account. The only transactions after June 2017 were monthly charges from ecoPayz of 
€1.50, described on Mr Ms statement as monthly maintenance fee. The first such charge 
appeared on Mr Ms account on 27 July 2018, some 13 months after the last activity on the 
account (Mr Ms initial deposits).
Ive seen a copy of a template email ecoPayz sends to its customers when their accounts 
have been dormant for 12 months. The email explains that a monthly maintenance fee will 
be charged and refers to the fees and limits and terms and conditions sections of ecoPayzs 
website. It goes on to say that the customer can avoid those fees by simply start using your 
account. And finishes by saying To start using your account now and avoid any 
maintenance fees, simply click on the button below and make a transaction.
ecoPayz has also sent me a system note showing the date it says it emailed Mr M regarding 
the account inactivity. The system note shows an email entitled Your account has been 
inactive for 12 months was sent to Mr M on 27 June 2018 at 00:49:27. 
Its common for financial businesses to keep records of template commutations in this 
manner, instead of keeping copies of the actual emails sent. In light of what ecoPayz has 
sent me, Im satisfied that it did in fact send the email to Mr M. And Ive seen nothing to 
support Mr Ms suggestion that ecoPayz forged the evidence it has provided. Mr M has also 
confirmed he received other emails from ecoPayz, so Im satisfied it used the correct email 
address.
Ive also seen a messaging thread between ecoPayz and Mr M from 7 March 2019. In it, 
ecoPayz explained that activity on the account requires transactions to be made, and 
referred Mr M to the terms and conditions of the account, along with the fees and limits 
section of its website.
In light of the above, Im satisfied ecoPayz was entitled to charge Mr M the fees it did under 
the terms and conditions of the account. And that it notified him in advance of applying the 
charges. While Mr M says logging into his account should qualify as activity, Im satisfied 
that wasnt the intention of the charge. The email ecoPayz sent to Mr M before the charges 
were applied explained that he would need to make a transaction to avoid charges. And I 
dont consider logging into an online account qualifies as activity: doing so is simply a way of 
viewing any activity (i.e. transactions) on the account. 
Im satisfied ecoPayz explained the true position sufficiently clearly in the email it sent before 
the charges were applied, the email it sent on 7 March 2019, the terms and conditions of the 
account, and the fees and limits section of ecoPayzs website.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint .
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 May 2021.
