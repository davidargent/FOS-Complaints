The complaint
Miss S complained that her credit card payment protection insurance (PPI) policy was 
cancelled in 2019 without her consent, and that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) did not comply with 
her request to reinstate the policy. Miss S also said that because of the cancellation, she 
was unable to make a claim on the policy.
What happened
Miss S contacted NewDay in June 2021 to check that PPI was still active on her Marbles 
credit card account. She was told that the PPI had been cancelled in October 2019. Miss S 
said that she had not consented to the cancellation, and wanted the cover reinstated, and 
she complained to NewDay about this. Miss S also said that she had been off work for some 
while and wouldve wanted to claim on the policy.
NewDay responded to this complaint to say that it couldnt establish why the PPI had been 
cancelled, and that it wasnt possible to reinstate the cover. It offered £70 as compensation 
for the inconvenience (I understand that this has since been increased to £120). Miss S 
wasnt happy with the response, so brought her complaint to this service.
During the course of the investigation of the complaint at this service. NewDay told us that it 
had found further information, in that the policy had been cancelled following a mis-sale 
complaint having been upheld by the previous provider of the credit card (the card provider 
has changed twice since Miss S took out the credit card some years ago). It also found that 
Miss S had contacted NewDay in November 2019 - after receiving a cancellation notice  to 
request reinstatement of the policy, but as NewDay didnt offer PPI it couldnt have 
reinstated it.
Our adjudicator thought that Miss Ss complaint should be upheld, and that NewDay should 
pay the amount of the claim that Miss S was unable to make due to the cancellation of the 
policy. NewDay disagreed, and asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman.
I issued a provisional decision in August 2022, in which I explained that I agreed with our 
adjudicator that the complaint should be upheld, but that the redress needed a more detailed 
explanation. Miss S said in her response that she had nothing further to add. NewDay 
responded to say that it accepted my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided that Miss Ss complaint should be upheld. Ill explain why.
In my provisional decision, I set out my findings as follows:
NewDay initially could not tell us why Miss Ss PPI had been cancelled, and thought it was 
most likely due to human error. However, over the course of the investigation of Miss Ss 
complaint, a clearer picture of the sequence of events emerged, and NewDay sent in copies 
of various documents in this respect.
It seems Miss S made a complaint about the sale of her PPI policy in August 2019. She told 
us this was prompted by a communication suggesting a review (although its not clear which 
of the card providers may have sent this  as I mentioned above, the credit card business 
changed hands, so there were three providers over the life of the card).
The complaint was considered by the previous card provider, and that business issued a 
final response letter dated 28 October 2019. The letter was headed Marbles  the credit 
card branding  and it said that Miss Ss mis-sale complaint had been upheld, but that as 
she had made claims on the policy and the amount paid out exceeded the amount due by 
way of compensation, no further payment was due. The letter also said that the PPI policy 
would be cancelled, but that If you don't want us to cancel the policy, please get in touch as 
soon as you can. The letter went on to say, If you have any further information that you'd 
like us to consider or you're unhappy with our final decision, please get in touch, giving a 
phone number and an address for contact.
Miss S also received a letter from NewDay, dated 29 October 2019. The letter was also 
headed Marbles and stated your Credit Card Repayments cover has been cancelled. That 
letter also gave a telephone number for queries.
Miss S contacted NewDay on 2 November 2019, saying she had not requested the 
cancellation of the PPI and asking for it to be reinstated. There is no call recording available, 
so I cant say what was discussed with Miss S during the call, but I have a copy of NewDays 
notes about this query. An investigation was held and a call that Miss S had made to 
NewDay on 28 October 2019 was listened to, as it had been assumed that she may have 
asked for the policy to be cancelled at that point. However, NewDay said there was no 
reference to cancellation of the policy during that call. The last item on these notes says that 
the query was referred to the relevant team to see if PPI could be continued. But there is 
nothing that indicates whether anything further happened  the query was marked as closed 
on 8 November 2019, and the PPI was not reinstated.
I should say at this point that NewDay told us that it did not offer PPI policies (but where 
Marbles cardholders had PPI in place when NewDay took over as the credit provider, the 
policies simply continued). For this reason, NewDay said it could not reinstate the policy 
itself.
Nothing further happened until June 2021, when Miss S contacted NewDay to check that the 
policy was still in place. But it was not, and this led to Miss Ss complaint to NewDay, which 
she then brought to this service.
When NewDay responded to Miss Ss complaint in August 2021, it said it couldnt reinstate 
the policy. It also suggested that Miss S could contact the insurer, or otherwise seek 
independent financial advice about PPI cover. NewDay also offered a payment in recognition 
of the inconvenience caused to Miss S, but it didnt think that Miss S was entitled to any 
further compensation.
NewDay argued that Miss S should have contacted the insurer or the previous credit 
provider, which had answered the mis sale complaint, to request that the PPI be reinstated. 
It said that as it had no proof that Miss S had made any contact with either, the cancellation 
of the PPI remained, and any reinstatement of her policy should have been done directly 
with the previous credit provider as it could not reinstate the policy itself. It said that, 
although a letter was issued to Miss S, and this informed her to contact NewDay should she 
have any queries regarding the cancellation of her PPI, it did not give her the option to reinstate it. In contrast, the letter received from the previous provider allowed her to request 
this to be reinstated.
NewDay also said that Miss S did not make it aware of the impact of the cancellation of the 
policy until she referred the complaint to this service, and as no evidence had been provided 
in relation to the claim that Miss S said she shouldve been able to make, it could not be 
confirmed that the claim wouldve been successful. NewDay further noted that, after the 
initial contact in November 2019, Miss S did not contact it again about the PPI until 2021. 
Ive thought carefully about what NewDay said. But the two letters that referred to the 
cancellation of the policy were issued at around the same time, so I cant know which letter 
Miss S received first - or indeed whether they arrived together. Both were headed Marbles, 
and I dont think Miss S could reasonably have been expected to know that she should have 
called the number given by the previous provider to reinstate the policy. In the event, Miss S 
contacted NewDay, and as I noted above the information provided does not show what 
happened to her query after it was referred to the relevant team.
I consider that Miss S did what was required of her at the time  that is, she confirmed, on 
receipt of the letters about the cancellation, that she did not want to cancel the policy. Ive no 
evidence to say that NewDay told Miss S that she would need to contact the previous 
provider or the insurer  and I think if it had done so Miss S most likely wouldve taken the 
necessary steps as she clearly wanted the cover to continue. So I dont consider that 
NewDay did what it reasonably ought to have done in 2019 to help Miss S reinstate the 
cover, and therefore my current conclusion is that this complaint should be upheld.
Our adjudicator said that, to put things right, NewDay should calculate the value of Miss Ss 
accident and sickness claim that she was unable to make in 2021, including interest.
However, I do accept NewDays point that there is no evidence in relation to the claim that 
Miss S would otherwise have made  but of course she has not been asked to provide any 
at this stage. Redress is intended to place the consumer in the position they would otherwise 
have been in if the error had not occurred. In this case, had the policy remained in force Miss 
S would have been able to submit a claim in the usual way.
As NewDay has accepted my provisional decision, I have no reason to change my 
conclusions and therefore I am upholding this complaint. I have set out below the steps 
NewDay should take to put things right.
Putting things right
If NewDay has not already paid the amount it promised - £120.00 - because of the 
inconvenience caused to Miss S, it should do so without delay.
NewDay should also stand in the shoes of the insurer in considering the claim that Miss S 
was otherwise unable to make because of the cancellation of the PPI. NewDay should seek 
assistance from the insurer in assessing the claim.
If the claim is valid under the terms of the policy, NewDay should pay the amount due to 
Miss S in respect of the claim, adding 8% simple interest per year from the date when Miss 
S would otherwise have been able to submit the claim to the date it is paid.
If the claim is successful, NewDay can deduct the amount Miss S wouldve paid in PPI 
premiums to the end date of the claim period had the policy been reinstated.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Ive decided to uphold Miss Ss complaint and to require 
NewDay Ltd to compensate Miss S as Ive described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 October 2022.
