K821x#15Complaint
Mr L complains  that Active Securities Limited (trading  as 247 Moneybox) lent him money 
that he couldnt afford to repay.
Background
Mr L took out 26 loans with 247 Moneybox  between October  2015  and July 2018. A 
summary of his loans  is contained in the attached  appendix.
Mr L wants 247 Moneybox  to refund the interest  and charges that he paid together with 
interest on the refund.
Before this service became involved, 247 Moneybox offered to remove all negative  
information about the loans from Mr Ls credit file.
The adjudicator recommended that Mr Ls complaint should be upheld  in part. In summary, 
he thought that 247 Moneybox should  not have agreed loans six to 26. 
The adjudicator asked 247 Moneybox to remove any negative information about loan six 
from Mr Ls credit file. He recommended that 247 Moneybox remove  loans seven onwards 
entirely from Mr Ls credit file. The adjudicator also recommended that 247 Moneybox  refund 
the interest and charges that Mr L had paid on the affected loans.
247 Moneybox disagreed  with the adjudicators view. It said that some gaps in lending 
indicated that Mr Ls circumstances may have changed between those periods.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
247 Moneybox needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that 247 
Moneybox should fairly and reasonably have done  more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN78056212the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think its important for me to start by saying that 247 Moneybox was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook defines sustainable as being  
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. 
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if they will need to borrow  
more money to afford the repayments.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
As Mr L hasnt objected to the adjudicators recommendation not to uphold  his complaint 
about loans one to five, I wont  say anything further about these and instead will concentrate  
on loans six to 26.
Loan six
247 Moneybox has told us that before  agreeing loan six, it asked Mr L for details of his 
income and outgoings and it carried out a credit  check. This was Mr Ls sixth loan in as 
many months. I think that 247 Moneybox  shouldve been doing more  than it did to make  sure 
that Mr L could afford to repay the loan.
If 247 Moneybox had carried out the kinds of checks that I think were proportionate, it seems 
likely that it wouldve discovered that Mr Ls income  had reduced  and hed recently  taken out 
a number of loans with other short term lenders. This meant that Mr L wasnt  able to 
sustainably afford to repay loan six.
With better checks, I dont  consider that 247 Moneybox would have agreed to lend.  It follows  
that I uphold  Mr Ls complaint  about  loan six.
Loan seven onwards
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of 247 Moneyboxs lending history with Mr L, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which 247 Moneybox should reasonably have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable or otherwise harmful.  And so 247 Moneybox should have 
realised that it shouldnt have given Mr L any more  loans.
Ref: DRN78056213Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ls case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
seven. I say this because the overall  pattern of Mr Ls borrowing suggested that hed 
become persistently reliant on short term loans.
By loan seven, Mr L had been borrowing from 247 Moneybox for around  eight months.  And 
the amount that Mr L was borrowing had increased significantly from his earlier loans.
Mr L applied for loan seven on the same day that he repaid loan six. I think  that this was an 
indication that Mr L might be having  difficulties  managing his money and was using short 
term loans for everyday  living  costs rather than one-off expenses.
Although the amounts that Mr L borrowed sometime fluctuated,  he never asked  for less than 
£300. Most of the time, Mr L was borrowing at least £500. So Mr L wasnt  making any real 
inroads into what he owed 247 Moneybox  and his indebtedness was being prolonged. This 
meant that Mr L had been paying large  amounts of interest to, in effect; service a debt to 247 
Moneybox over a long period.
I appreciate that 247 Moneybox says that there were  some gaps in Mr Ls lending  history. I 
dont consider that these gaps were sufficiently  long enough to effectively break  the chain in 
lending. And Im not persuaded  the breaks that 247 Moneybox points to should necessarily 
have been taken as an indication that Mr L had moved on from whatever situation  had 
required his previous loans. Particularly as after the longest break of around three and a half 
months, Mr L took out the largest  of all of the loans. 
I think that Mr L lost out because 247 Moneybox continued to lend money from loan seven 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the extended period of time he owed 247 Moneybox money  was likely to have had 
negative implications on Mr Ls ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Ls complaint about  loans six to 26.
Putting things  right  what  247 Moneybox  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges that Mr L paid on loans six to 26;
 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;  
remove any negative information  about loan six from Mr Ls credit file; and
the number  of loans taken by the time of loan seven means that any information about  
loans seven to 26 is negative. So all entries  about loans seven to 26 should be removed 
from Mr Ls credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 247 Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 247 
Moneybox must give Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
Ref: DRN78056214My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ls complaint in part and direct  Active  Securities Limited 
(trading as 247 Moneybox) to put things right as detailed  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 September  2019.
