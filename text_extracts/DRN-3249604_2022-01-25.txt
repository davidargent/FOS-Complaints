The complaint
Mrs J complains that Paypal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (Paypal) are refusing to assist her in 
the recovery of funds she paid into the wrong account.  
What happened
In April 2021 Mrs J paid £500.65 from her PayPal account into the account that was linked to 
her PayPal account, which she thought was her bank account. 
She says she subsequently found out that she had used the wrong account number. 
Mrs J asked PayPal to help her to recover the funds as an unauthorised transaction but they 
have rejected her application as they ruled that the transaction was not unauthorised. 
PayPal issued a final response on 26 May 2021 in which they said that the complaint was 
not accepted and had been addressed. 
Mrs J brought her complaint to us. 
One of our investigators looked into Mrs Js complaint. She thought that PayPal had acted in 
a fair and reasonable manner.  
Mrs J disagreed with our investigators view and has asked for an ombudsmans decision 
which is why it has come to me to review.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have not upheld the complaint and I will explain my reasons below. 
I have reviewed all the information sent to us by PayPal and by Mrs J.   
PayPal have rejected Mrs Js clam for an unauthorised transaction because they say that 
this does not class as an unauthorised transaction because Miss J authorised it and the 
funds were paid to a linked account which she had previously used with her PayPal account. 
I can see from the information provided to us by PayPal that the linked bank account was 
added to Mrs Js PayPal account in October 2019. The information shows that after being 
added, PayPal sent a £1 deposit to the account, with a verification code which would appear 
on the users bank statement. This confirmation code has to be input into the PayPal 
account to verify the linked bank account. The records show that this code was input into 
Mrs Js PayPal account to confirm the account. So, although Mrs J may not have access to 
the account anymore, it seems that in 2019 when the account was linked, she did have 
access and authorised it as a linked account. 
 
I can also see from the information provided that Mrs J previously withdrew PayPal funds to 
the linked bank account in October 2019. 
However, it appears that by January 2021 Mrs J was no longer using the account but hadnt 
removed it as the linked account on PayPal. She tried to make a payment to a fast food 
company on 15 January 2021 which did not complete because when PayPal tried to draw 
the funds from the linked bank account, it was denied. PayPal say Mrs J would have been 
notified of this by them, but I havent seen any evidence of that. 
In addition, when she transferred the £500.65 from her PayPal account, Mrs J would have 
been asked which account she wanted to transfer them to and she would have been given 
the opportunity to check the account details. Unfortunately, it would appear that she didnt, 
and the payment went to the linked account which she no longer has access to. 
 
In view of the above, I cant fairly say that PayPal have done anything wrong here. The bank 
account in question was registered and verified on Mrs Js PayPal account, and it was her 
responsibility to check that the payment was going to the correct recipient, and to update the 
details of any linked accounts. 
It would appear that this was a bank account that she at some point had access to and she 
did authorise the withdrawal to the account, and so I dont think that PayPal are acting 
unfairly when they say that it isnt an unauthorised transaction.  
I appreciate that this isnt the outcome that Mrs J had hoped for and can understand how 
frustrated she must be at having lost the funds, but she will need to approach the receiving 
bank to raise this. 
 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Js complaint about 
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA.  
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 February 2022.
