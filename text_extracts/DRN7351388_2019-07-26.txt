K821x#15complaint
Mr B has complained about loans he took out through MYJAR Limited  (MYJAR). He says 
MYJAR lent to him irresponsibly and he also says that he struggled to pay household bills 
due to having to repay  these loans.  
background
Mr B took 26 loans from MYJAR between March 2016 and January 2018. And Ive enclosed  
a summary of Mr Bs borrowing, based on the information provided to us from MYJAR, which  
can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision.
Our adjudicator concluded that from loan 7, Mr B was showing a pattern of lending that 
made this and any following loans unsustainable.  So the adjudicator thought,  MYJAR 
shouldve stopped lending to Mr B at that point and recommended that loans 7 to 26 be 
upheld.
Mr B appears to have  accepted the adjudicators  view. 
MYJAR didnt agree  with the adjudicators findings. It said that the adjudicators reasoning  
was vague and they didnt  appear  to have taken into account any of the information and data 
MYJAR supplied in their file about the lending decision. 
No agreement could  be reached,  so the case  has been passed to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. And Ive followed this approach when thinking about 
Mr Bs complaint.  
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when  MYJAR  lent to Mr B. 
The FCAs Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC) is the specialist sourcebook  for credit-
related regulated activities. It sets out the rules and guidance specific  to consumer credit 
providers, such as MYJAR. 
I am not quoting all the specific  regulations  here, because I would expect MYJAR to be 
familiar with these through previous ombudsman decisions, particularly recent  decisions,  
which set these rules out in more detail.
It is important  to note that the FCA didnt, and doesnt, specify exactly  how an assessment of 
affordability is to be carried out but the extent  and scope and the types  and sources of 
information to use needed to be enough  to be able to reasonably  assess  the sustainability  
of the arrangement for the consumer.
In other  words the assessment  needs  to be consumer-focussed.  It is not an assessment of 
the risk to the lender  of not recovering the credit but of the risk to the consumer of incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant  adverse  consequence  as a result of the 
decision to lend.
Ref: DRN73513882As set out in CONC,  the risk to the consumer  directly  relates  to the particulars of the lending  
and the circumstances of the consumer. Therefore, a lenders assessment of 
creditworthiness would  likely need to be flexible. That is to say, what is sufficient for one 
consumer might not be for another, or indeed  what might  be sufficient for a consumer in one 
circumstance might not be so for the same  consumer in other circumstances.
Bearing the above in mind, I would expect an assessment  of creditworthiness  to vary with 
circumstance. In general, Id expect  a lender to require more  assurance, the greater the 
potential risk to the consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way.  
Certain factors might point to the fact that MYJAR should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include, 
but are not limited  to:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So MYJAR was required  to establish whether Mr B could  sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  Mr B could 
sustainably make his repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because CONC defines sustainable  as being  without undue difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; and without having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. 
So, it follows  that a lender  should  realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably - if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make them without borrowing further.  
MYJAR has told this service it carried out detailed and extensive  checks before agreeing to 
lend to Mr B. It says it asked Mr B about  his employment status, income  and monthly 
expenses. It also said it carried out a check of his credit file as well as using its own internal 
systems to decide whether these loans  were affordable. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. But, as MYJAR  and Mr B dont appear 
to be unhappy  about the adjudicators findings  in relation to loans 1  6, these loans are no 
longer in dispute, so I wont be reviewing them as part of my decision. 
Ref: DRN73513883Like the adjudicator,  Ive also looked at the overall pattern of MYJARs lending  history with 
Mr B, with a view to seeing  if there was a point  at which MYJAR should reasonably have  
seen that further  lending  was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  And so MYJAR should  
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 1 - 6 of Mr B taking  new loans shortly 
after repaying previous ones. I think that by loan 7, MYJAR  ought fairly and 
reasonably to have  regarded  that pattern as established. By the seventh loan Mr B 
had either taken a new loan,  or had repayments  due to an existing loan for the last 
six months.  I think this indicated that Mr B was becoming dependent on this type of 
borrowing.
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr B was provided  with a new loan the majority  of the time 
within two days of settling  a previous loan and there was no sustained, significant 
reduction in his borrowing. So MYJAR ought to have realised it was more  likely than 
not Mr B was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan 
was leaving in his finances, and that Mr Bs indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
Mr B wasnt reducing the amounts he owed to MYJAR. For example, loan 20 was 
taken out 18 months after Mr Bs first loan was approved, and the value of this loan 
was for more than double the sum of his first loan. 
By loan 26, Mr B had already been borrowing from MYJAR for over 22 months, yet 
this final loan was due to run for a period of 12 months. So in approving  this loan 
MYJAR effectively extended Mr Bs indebtedness for a further year. The result  of this 
wouldve meant that Mr Bs entire borrowing period wouldve been nearly three years.  
I think that Mr B lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time, 
and
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Bs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 7 - 26 and MYJAR should put things right as set 
out below.
Ref: DRN73513884putting things right
In order to put things  right for Mr B, MYJAR  should;
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 7 - 26;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 - 26 should be removed from 
Mr Bs credit file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Bs complaint. 
MYJAR Limited should put things right for Mr B as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 August 2019.
