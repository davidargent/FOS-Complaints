 Our adjudicator upheld Mr Hs complaint in part and thought the loans from 9 onwards 
shouldn't have been given. Sunny disagreed, although accepted what the adjudicator had 
said in relation to loans 15 onwards, so the complaint was passed to me.
My findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Sunny has accepted the general approach our adjudicator took to investigating Mr H's 
complaint. It agreed that the pattern of lending suggested it ought to agree to uphold the 
complaint in respect of some of Mr H's loans. Where there's still disagreement is at what 
point Sunny ought to have realised it should stop lending to Mr H. Sunny says that the right 
point is loan 15 (one year after it started lending); our adjudicator thought the right point was loan 9 mainly because Mr H had taken six drawdowns from his flexible credit facility and 
then eight instalment loans in seven months and that pattern suggested further loans would 
be unlikely to be sustainable.
Ive looked afresh at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldn't have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
9. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr H was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr H had taken out eight loans (and made several drawdowns on his 
credit facility) within seven months. There were no real breaks in the lending and loan 
9 was taken out on the same day Mr H had settled loans 6 and 8. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr H was having to borrow further to cover 
the hole repaying his previous loan(s) was leaving in his finances and that Mr Hs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
The overall amounts Mr H was borrowing, bearing in mind some of his loans 
overlapped, was increasing. Given this and the length of the lending relationship by 
the time of loan 9, Sunny ought to have known that Mr H was not likely borrowing to 
meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr H wasn't making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. His last loans 
were taken out well over a year after his first. And together they were for a larger 
amount. Mr H had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny 
over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr H lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 9 onwards 
because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
The number of loans Sunny approved for Mr H was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost loans.
 
So Im upholding the complaint about loans 9 to 25.
putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 9 to 25;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from loan 9 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about these loans 9 to 25 should be removed 
from Mr Hs credit file.
 
HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.my final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr H's complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited put things right by taking the steps set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 January 2020.
