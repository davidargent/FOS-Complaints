The complaint
Ms T complains because she believes NewDay Ltd retook a sum of money from her that had 
previously been refunded to her credit card account. 
What happened
Ms T had a credit card issued by NewDay. She cleared her balance in full every month via 
direct debit. 
In January 2020 Ms T paid £111.04 to an airline for flights using her credit card. 
The airline went out of business before the flights took place. Ms T asked NewDay to step in 
and help in March 2020. 
NewDay said it raised a chargeback in March 2020 (a mechanism a bank can use to recover 
sums paid to a merchant) and credited the sum of £111.04 to Ms Ts account pending the 
outcome of the chargeback. NewDay has said the chargeback was not defended and so the 
credit was never retaken from Ms Ts account.
In May 2022 Ms T received a refund on an unrelated transaction for £113.80. There had 
been no spending on her credit card in the previous month. So, Ms T said she assumed, 
having cleared her balance in full the previous month, that the refund would put her account 
in credit to the sum of £113.80. 
Instead however, Ms Ts May 2022 statement showed that NewDay adjusted Ms Ts account 
and used the refund to offset what it said was an outstanding balance of £111.04  leaving a 
small credit balance on her account of £2.76. 
Ms T complained to NewDay as she believed it had retaken the sum relating to the flight 
from two years earlier from her. She said the refund she received in May 2022 related to 
something shed bought for a friend and had been earmarked for paying that person back. 
NewDay said it hadnt retaken the sum from Ms T. But it had, in error, been collecting 
£111.04 less than her full balance every month since April 2020. So, it said because Ms T 
still owed this sum, it made an adjustment to the account when it entered a position of credit 
in May 2022. 
Our investigator thought NewDay should pay £111.04 to Ms T as he wasnt persuaded Ms T 
owed that sum to NewDay when it adjusted her account. 
NewDay didnt agree with the investigator and asked an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. 
I contacted the parties in April 2023 to explain why it appeared to me that NewDay hadnt 
taken the money from Ms T unreasonably. I said, in summary:
Ms Ts April 2020 monthly statement showed that Newday credited her with £111.04 
in March 2020 after she asked for its help to get a refund of the cost of her failed 
flights. 
From that point onwards the sum NewDay had collected from Ms T every month was 
£111.04 less than the sum required to clear her balance in full. This was an error by 
NewDay where it had both credited Ms Ts account with the refund and also held the 
same amount back from the sum it collected from her every month. 
Because this situation had never been properly addressed by NewDay, it continued 
for two years and Ms T still owed it £111.04 in May 2022. 
So, when NewDay offset the refund Ms T received on an unrelated transaction in 
May 2022 against this sum, it was correcting the account rather than retaking the 
refund it had provided two years earlier. 
NewDay had paid compensation of £80 to Ms T for its error and this looked on the 
face of it to be fair compensation for its error. 
Ms T disagreed with what I said and asked me to issue a decision on her complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to assure Ms T that Ive carefully studied all of her monthly statements between 
January 2020 and June 2022. But having done so, Ive not seen anything that makes me 
think NewDay took £111.04 from Ms T when it shouldnt have
Its clear enough to me from Ms Ts monthly statements that what NewDay did here was 
credit her account with the refund for the flights but also hold the same amount back from 
the sums it was collecting from her every month. The latter of these is what a bank will 
sometimes do while a transaction remains in dispute so that interest does not accrue on the 
transaction. However, because NewDay had already credited the refund to Ms T, it need not 
have done this as well. 
It appears NewDay then forgot to take the sum out of dispute. So, it continued to take 
£111.04 less than the total balance from Ms T every month for around two years. 
Ive tried to bring this to life better in the following simplified hypothetical scenario. 
Say Ms T paid £50 for a flight in January 2020. 
The airline went bust in March 2020 and Ms T asked her bank to help her get it back. 
The bank issued a credit to Ms Ts credit card account of £50 in March 2020 having 
successfully recovered it from the airline via chargeback.
Ms T spent £150 that month (and cleared her account balance in full in the previous 
month so owed no interest). So, to clear her balance in full the following month, Ms T 
would need to pay her bank £100 (£150 spending less the £50 credit)
The bank, in error, asked Ms T to pay £50 less than this on her monthly statement as 
it had marked £50 as in dispute still. So, it only asked Ms T to pay £50  which she 
did.Ms Ts balance for that month should have been £100, not £50. So, after paying what 
the bank had asked her to, she was £50 short of clearing her balance in full.
The following month Ms T spent £200, added to the £50 the bank didnt take the 
previous month, the sum required to pay her balance in full was £250. 
The bank only asked Ms T to pay £200 that month on her monthly statement.
This same pattern continued every month for two years.
Eventually Ms T didnt spend anything one month, having paid everything the bank 
had asked her to the previous month (i.e her full balance less £50). She received a 
refund on an unrelated transaction for £52 in that month also.
The bank uses most of that £52 to pay off the £50 it had incorrectly held in dispute for 
two years.
The correct position on the account therefore is that it should be in credit of £2. 
While the position Ms T found herself in was clearly the result of an administrative error by 
NewDay, I dont think it meant NewDay acted unreasonably when it offset the credit on the 
account against the outstanding balance as Ms T did owe £111.04 to NewDay. I recognise 
Ms T thinks she has lost out on this sum and paid for flights she didnt receive. But I assure 
her this isnt the case and that from what I have seen her account looks to be in the position 
it should be in i.e. she has received a full credit for the cost of the flights that has not been 
retaken by NewDay. Ms Ts statements also show that no interest was charged on the 
£111.04 while it was held in dispute. So, she hasnt lost out in that way either. 
Nevertheless, I recognise that it took NewDay far longer than it should have to realise what 
had happened. And when it did eventually make the appropriate correction, I can understand 
why Ms T was disappointed that a sum she thought shed be able to use to pay back her 
friend was not now going to be available for her. 
NewDay provided compensation of £80 for the error. I think this fairly reflects the distress 
and inconvenience Ms T has said she experienced, and the sum of money involved. I dont 
find therefore that NewDay has to do anything else in respect of her complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd has done enough to resolve Ms Ts complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms T to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 June 2023.
