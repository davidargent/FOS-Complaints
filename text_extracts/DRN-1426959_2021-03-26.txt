The complaint
Mr M complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
RCI Financial Services Limited, trading as Nissan Finance, wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A new electric car was supplied to Mr M under a hire purchase agreement with Nissan 
Finance that he signed in September 2016. He had some issues with the cars battery life 
and the built-in app for finding charging points and the car stopped working at the roadside. 
He returned the car to the dealer but no fault was found so he cancelled his direct debit for 
the monthly payments under the agreement in November 2018 and he complained to Nissan 
Finance about the car in February 2019. 
It didnt uphold his complaint and asked him to pay the arrears on his account. Mr M wasnt 
satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator didnt recommend 
that his complaint should be upheld. She wasnt satisfied that there was enough evidence to 
show that there was a fault with the car that was present or developing at the time of sale. 
Mr R has responded to the investigators recommendation in detail and has asked for his 
complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary and amongst other 
things, that:
the car isnt safe or durable as its battery life is affected by bad weather and it can 
run out of charge at any point with 12 miles use still showing;
he complained to the dealer about the cars battery life in January and March 2017 
and August 2018 but it did nothing;
the charging point app is essential but has never worked (and was wrong on his 
previous car); and
he sent multiple e-mails to Nissan Finance and phoned it four or five times and only 
received one voicemail (to which he replied straight away).
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Nissan Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr M - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car that was supplied to Mr M had a price of £17,958.44 and was a new car so I 
consider that it was reasonable for him to expect that it would be free from even 
minor defects;
Mr M has complained about issues with the cars battery life and the built-in app for 
finding charging points - the car was inspected by the dealer in August 2018 but no 
concern with the battery cell was identified and the car was tested in December 2018 
when the charge was holding 131 miles which it said was typical for this model  and 
our investigator has explained why it wouldnt be realistic for Mr M to achieve the test 
mileage that was recorded in controlled conditions;
Mr M feels very strongly that the car isnt of satisfactory quality and is unsafe  hes 
described the difficulties that hes experienced when the car ran out of charge and 
the impact that it had on him and his family (and he says that a major part of his 
complaint is that he and his family were left stranded on multiple occasions); 
I sympathise with Mr M for those difficulties but hes provided no mechanical or 
independent evidence to show that theres a fault with the car and the dealer has 
inspected and tested the cars battery and found no fault;
Mr M has clearly had significant issues with the cars charging point app which hes 
described in detail and hes provided photos showing some of the issues that hes 
experienced - but the app has been checked by the dealer and no fault was found 
(but it did change some settings) and Im not persuaded that hes provided enough 
evidence to show that theres a fault with the app that was present when the car was 
supplied to him or that the car isnt of satisfactory quality because of those issues;
he raised concerns about the issues that he had with the car with the dealer in 
January and March 2017 and in August 2018  and he cancelled his direct debit and 
stopped making the monthly payments to Nissan Finance in November 2018 - but he 
didnt complain to Nissan Finance about the issues with the car until February 2019, 
nearly two and a half years after the car had been supplied to him;
Nissan Finances records show that it sent seven letters and a notice of sums in 
arrears and left voicemail messages for Mr M after he stopped making the payments 
to it but that he hadnt contacted it about the arrears so it issued a default notice to 
Mr M in February 2019  and that he then contacted it to complain about the car;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mr M to have contacted Nissan 
Finance about the issues with the car before he received the default notice and I 
dont consider that he had the right to stop making the payments that hed agreed to 
make in the hire purchase agreement;
the account statement for Mr Ms agreement shows that he hasnt made a payment 
for the car since October 2018 and the outstanding balance on the account has been 
£12,930.90 since May 2019 when Nissan Finance ended the agreement  but Mr M 
still has the car and has continued to use it;
the car passed an MOT test in June 2020 when its mileage was recorded as 53,742 
 I dont consider that its likely that Mr M would have been able to drive the car that 
far in less than four years if the car hadnt been of satisfactory quality  and the 
agreement included an annual limit of 15,000 miles (above which excess mileage 
charges would be applied) so the mileage driven in the car has been consistent with 
the agreed annual mileage limit;
Mr M is clearly unhappy with the way that Nissan Finance has dealt with his 
complaint and he says that he sent multiple e-mails to Nissan Finance and phoned it 
four or five times but only received one voicemail  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the customer service that hes received from Nissan 
Finance has fallen below a reasonably acceptable standard; and
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr M and I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Nissan Finance to refund to 
Mr M any of the money that hes paid it for the car, to pay him any compensation or 
to take any other action in response to his complaint.
I suggest that Mr M contacts Nissan Finance to try to agree an affordable repayment 
arrangement for the outstanding balance of his account. If he doesnt do so, I consider it to 
be likely that it will take action to recover that amount from him, to the extent that its legally 
entitled to do so.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 April 2021.
