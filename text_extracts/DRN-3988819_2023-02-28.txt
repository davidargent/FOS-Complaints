The complaint
Mr K complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money unfairly recorded a 
default on his credit file.
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. I said: 
Mr K had a loan with 118 118 Money. During the pandemic, the loan fell into arrears. 
118 118 Money approved a payment holiday for several months and went on to agree a 
payment arrangement whereby Mr K would pay £20 a month instead of the contractual 
payment of £185. Due to the difference between the arrangement and contractual monthly 
payment, arrears continued to accrue on Mr Ks loan.
On 8 October 2021 118 118 Money sent Mr K a default notice that said he needed to make a 
payment to clear arrears by 29 October 2021. Shortly before that date Mr K spoke with an 
agent at 118 118 Money who advised he could make the payment on or by 29 October 
2021. Mr K made the payment given in the default notice on 29 October 2021 and has told 
us he thought that would mean the default wouldnt be recorded.
118 118 Money says it took the decision to default Mr Ks account as he didnt make the 
payment by 29 October 2021, in line with the default notice it sent. Mr K went on to raise a 
complaint and 118 118 Money sent him a final response. 118 118 Money didnt agree it had 
acted unfairly by applying a default to Mr Ks credit file and didnt uphold his complaint.
An investigator at this service looked at Mr Ks complaint. They accepted that an agent at 
118 118 Moneys agent had told Mr K he could pay on 29 October 2021 but didnt think it 
had acted unfairly overall. Mr K didnt agree and said hed followed 118 118 Moneys 
instructions and been advised that if he made the payment no default wouldve been applied. 
As Mr K didnt accept the investigators view, his complaint has been passed to me to make 
a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at Mr Ks loan history and contact with 118 118 Money. I can see that Mr K 
experienced financial difficulties as a result of how his work was impacted by the pandemic 
and sought support from 118 118 Money. Payment holidays were agreed for a limited 
period, in line with industry guidance. And 118 118 Money agreed to accept partial payments 
under an arrangement when he was unable to make them in full. In my view, 118 118 Money 
made treated Mr K fairly when he was experiencing financial difficulties.
I think its fair to note that even though 118 118 Money agreed a payment arrangement, 
arrears continued to accrue on the loan. Thats because the contractual monthly payment 
wasnt being made. As a result of the arrears, 118 118 Money sent Mr K a default notice. 
That said he needed to make a payment to clear the arrears by 29 October 2021. Its clear 
Mr K wanted to avoid the default. 118 118 Moneys contact notes show he spoke with an 
agent on 25 October 2021 and they noted he would make the payment on or before 29 
October 2021. I accept that when Mr K called back on 29 October 2021 it was with the 
expectation that the payment he made would stop the default process.
I agree that the call handler Mr K spoke with on 25 October 2021 shouldve been clear in 
explaining he needed to pay before 29 October 2021. Ive considered how the default has 
impacted Mr K and whether it would be fair to tell 118 118 Money to amend his credit file and 
reinstate the loan as a result of the call he had on 25 October 2021.
I can see how disappointed Mr K was when he found out the default would still be recorded. 
But, looking at Mr Ks contact with 118 118 Money in the weeks and months that followed, 
he explained financial difficulties were ongoing. Payments of £20 a month were made and 
others missed. So whilst I agree that Mr K wasnt given the right information, I think its fair to 
say its likely his account wouldve most likely closed at default in the months that followed 
for similar reasons. In my view, Mr Ks account is in broadly the same position. So whilst I 
agree 118 118 Money did likely make a mistake during Mr Ks call on 25 October 2021, I
havent been persuaded it would be fair to tell it to remove the default.
With that being said, its clear the call on 25 October 2021 did cause Mr K to believe he had 
an extra day to pay. And finding a substantial sum to clear arrears only to have the account 
default anyway was clearly very disappointing and upsetting. In my view, it would be fair for 
118 118 Money to recognise the distress and inconvenience caused to Mr K by paying him 
£200. Based on the information Ive seen, I intend to uphold Mr Ks complaint and direct 
118 118 Money to pay him £200.
I invited both parties to respond with any additional comments or information they wanted 
me to consider before I made my final decision. Mr K responded and said that if the 
complaint was being upheld we should tell 118 118 Money to remove the default from his 
credit file which was the focus of his complaint. Mr K said he was told to make a payment on 
or before a particular date and that he followed instructions. Mr K asked me to relook at the 
decision and consider telling 118 118 Money to remove the default. We didnt hear back 
from 118 118 Money. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Mr Ks view that 118 118 Money unfairly recorded a default despite making a 
payment to clear the arrears as directed. But in my provisional decision I noted that Mr K 
made payments of £20 to 118 118 Money in the months that followed the default, with some 
being missed. I felt this strongly indicated that Mr Ks circumstances around this time meant 
the account would likely have defaulted in any case. Ive looked back at 118 118 Moneys 
contact notes with Mr K and can see that after the default was applied he confirmed financial 
difficulties were ongoing and that he was able to make payments of £20 a month. But, that 
was substantially less than the contractual monthly payment Mr K wouldve had to maintain 
to avoid the account moving to default, despite having cleared the existing arrears. Im very 
sorry to disappoint Mr K but I still think his account would most likely have defaulted which 
means hes in broadly the same position. 
Whilst I agree that 118 118 Money made mistakes, I havent been persuaded to tell it to 
remove the default from Mr Ks credit file. I remain of the view that 118 118 Money caused Mr K an unreasonable level of distress and inconvenience. Ive considered everything Mr Ks 
said, but I havent been persuaded to change my view of how to fairly resolve his complaint. 
I still think 118 118 Money should pay Mr K £200 for the distress and inconvenience caused, 
for the same reasons. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ks complaint and direct Madison CF UK Limited trading as 
118 118 Money to pay him £200 for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 March 2023.
