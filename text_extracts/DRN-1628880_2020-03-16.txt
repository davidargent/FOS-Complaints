The complaint
Mr T complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) gave him incorrect 
information in regard to an unsecured loan account, which resulted in him being in arrears.
What happened
In May 2018, Mr T took out an unsecured loan with NatWest. Around March 2019, Mr T 
called NatWest and asked if he could put his loan repayment on hold for one month as he 
had recently been made redundant.
Mr T says he was told by NatWest he could cancel his direct debit for one month and then 
catch up with his payment the following month. Mr T cancelled his direct debit at the end of 
March 2019.
A few days later Mr T says his loan account was passed to the collections team at NatWest. 
Mr T says he spoke to the collections team and was told he could refinance both his loan 
and overdraft into one smaller monthly payment.
Mr T completed some income and expenditure forms and says he was told the loan account 
was put on hold at this point. NatWest then told Mr T he couldnt refinance the loan as his 
circumstances showed it was unaffordable.
Mr T complained to NatWest. Amongst other things he said he was given incorrect 
information about refinancing the loan and told his account wouldnt pass to collections.
NatWest partially upheld Mr Ts complaint. It said it didnt dispute Mr Ts version of events 
and refunded his loan arrears from March to August 2019. It also amended Mr Ts credit file 
to remove any adverse data for this timeframe and offered Â£50 compensation.
Mr T didnt accept NatWests response and referred the complaint to our service. Our 
investigator looked at everything and didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. She didnt 
find any evidence Mr T was told he could miss a monthly payment and make up for it the 
following month. Instead she found he was told he couldnt make a double payment in the 
following month.
Our investigator also commented Mr T had been on a payment plan for some time before 
the complaint was raised. She found evidence the refinancing of the loan was one of the 
options discussed with Mr T, but he would need to meet the eligibility criteria in order for it to 
be accepted. She found NatWests offer of compensation was reasonable and didnt 
recommend it do any more. 
NatWest accepted our investigators view. Mr T disagreed. He said he thought the loan was 
on hold and didnt realise arrears were accumulating. 
Our investigator spoke to NatWest to see if Mr Ts repayments could be spread over a 
longer period. NatWest said they couldnt, as it would be the same as refinancing the loan.Our investigator reiterated her findings to Mr T and said refinancing the loan was an option, 
not a promise. She said Mr Ts current income and expenditure forms showed he didnt have 
enough disposable income to refinance the loan. She also said regardless of the information 
given, had Mr T made the double repayment as he originally requested and maintained his 
monthly repayments, the loan wouldnt be in arrears now. 
Our investigator added that Mr T entered into a repayment contract with NatWest when he 
took out the loan to make monthly repayments, so NatWest didnt need to do any more to 
make him aware of the consequences of missing payments. So she concluded NatWest had 
acted fairly in the circumstances.
Mr T maintained he has been working with NatWest on advice his debt was on hold pending 
a refinance. He says had he known there were arrears he would have managed things 
differently. To settle the complaint, Mr T proposed NatWest meets him half-way by writing off 
half of the arrears, incorporating the remainder into the loan, and refinancing the whole 
amount.
NatWest said it wants to work with Mr T to put in place an affordable repayment plan. But it 
said it needs to make sure he can afford to repay the loan and the arrears, and so far it 
hasnt seen evidence he can. NatWest says if Mr T cant show he can afford it, the only 
remaining option is for the account to go down the default process. NatWest says once this 
process is complete interest and charges will stop, and Mr Ts account will be passed to a 
debt collection agent who will have the ability to agree a much lower repayment amount for 
the outstanding debt.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I wont be upholding this complaint or requiring NatWest to do anything 
further, and for broadly the same reasons as our investigator. Ill explain why below.
In order to determine if NatWest have treated Mr T fairly, Ive considered the relevant 
regulations which apply here. The Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC) sets out what 
lenders should do when a consumer notifies them they are in financial difficulty. Specifically, 
CONC 7.3.4 states, a firm must treat customers in default or arrears with forbearance and 
due consideration. In other words, NatWest is expected to show it has treated Mr T 
positively and sympathetically.
CONC 7.3.5 gives examples of how NatWest could do this, including suspending, reducing, 
waiving, or cancelling any further interest or charges, or allowing deferment of payment of 
arrearsprovided that doing so does not make the term for the repayments unreasonably 
excessive. And CONC 7.3.6 states that Where a customer is in default or arrears 
difficulties, a firm should allow the customer reasonable time and opportunity to repay the 
debt.
Ive considered the contact notes on Mr Ts account from the point he first told NatWest 
about his financial difficulty in March 2019. From the evidence Ive seen, Im satisfied 
NatWest treated Mr T positively and sympathetically. Ill explain why.
I can see from the contact note on 27 March 2019 that Mr T was referred to NatWests 
hardship team as soon as it was aware of his circumstances, but he declined the offer as he didnt want the account to affect his credit file. So I dont think NatWest needed to do 
anymore at this stage than it did. 
I can also see Mr T was advised not to double up his loan repayment on the same note. So 
regardless of what advice Mr T may have been given previously I think it was made clear to 
him he couldnt do this. 
The next contact note from 5 April 2019 acknowledges Mr T cancelled his direct debit for the 
loan, which broke the payment plan agreed before. It says Mr T was made aware no more 
plans can be agreed and advised of collections actions and credit file impact. So based on 
this I am satisfied NatWest discussed the impact of not paying his loan.
Following this call, the notes indicate NatWest put Mr Ts interest and charges on hold until 
he completed an income and expenditure form. I think NatWests actions were reasonable 
here as it acknowledged Mr T was struggling financially and was working to find a solution 
with him. 
NatWest reviewed Mr Ts income and expenditure and told him his current circumstances 
meant a repayment plan was unaffordable. Mr T said he was told he could have a 
repayment plan. Having considered everything, I havent seen any evidence to support      
Mr Ts statement here. So I dont think NatWest has treated him unfairly or promised a 
repayment plan to him.
Mr T has said a number of times during this complaint he has been working on advice from 
NatWest that his loan account is on hold pending a refinance. I want to reassure Mr T Ive 
thought carefully about this point. But on balance, the contact notes Ive seen from
April 2019 indicate the consequences of not paying the loan were discussed. So I dont think 
NatWest has done anything to suggest the entire account was on hold. 
I havent seen any evidence of further repayments to the loan since Mr T cancelled his direct 
debit in March 2019 to date  so he hasnt shown that he has been prepared to reduce the 
debt whilst discussing his options with NatWest. This means arrears have continued to 
accrue. I think NatWest did say what the consequences of not paying the loan would be, so I 
think its fair for it to factor in these arrears into any future repayment plan. I also think 
NatWest has given Mr T reasonable time and opportunity to repay the debt.
I wont be commenting on the merits of Mr Ts proposal to settle the complaint. NatWest has 
assessed Mr Ts proposal and maintained any solution needs to be affordable to him, but 
also pay off the loan arrears in a reasonable timeframe. I think this is a fair approach for it to 
take and in line with the relevant regulations. I also think its decision to potentially default the 
loan is reasonable if Mr T cant afford the repayment plan due to the number of missed 
payments.
I appreciate Mr T will be disappointed with the outcome Ive reached. But based on 
everything Ive seen, Im not persuaded NatWest agreed Mr T could freeze his entire 
monthly repayments on the loan, or that there was sufficient ambiguity in the information he 
was given to suggest he didnt need to make any repayments. So I wont be requiring 
NatWest to compensate Mr T further.
 
 
  
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 April 2020.
