DRN-3389699
The complaint
Mr A complains that American Express Services Europe Limited (AESEL) rejected his claim 
under section 75 Consumer Credit Act 1974 in respect of a faulty laptop.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute so instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons: 
Mr A holds a charge card with AESEL and not a credit card. The terms under which the card 
is issued mean that it does not offer credit and so it falls outside section 75. That means 
section 75 does not apply and AESEL is not required to accept his claim.
Mr A has said he wasnt aware he had a charge card rather than a credit card, but I have 
seen no evidence to that effect. He took the card out in 2010 and I am not aware of any 
material that would have led him to reach that conclusion.
Our investigator has also considered whether a chargeback should have been made, but Mr 
A didnt let AESEL know about the issue until after the 120 days deadline. As such I cannot 
say that the business did anything wrong.
Mr A has said that our fair and reasonable remit should override the law. I regret on this 
matter I am constrained by the law. I cannot ask AESEL to pay for something which it is not 
legally obliged to cover.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 May 2022.
