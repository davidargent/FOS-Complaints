The complaint
Mr and Mrs B complain about delays by TSB Bank PLC when processing a cheque. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
TSB identified that a cheque for Mrs B wasn't completed in line with the account 
names. I think TSBs decision not to process Mrs Bs cheque was reasonable. 
TSB has apologised for using an incorrect date stamp on Mr and Mrs Bs receipt. 
Im satisfied TSB tried to contact Mr and Mrs B using the contact information it held 
on file. As Mr and Mrs Bs phone number wasn't up to date, TSB wasnt able to call 
them. But I agree TSB could have written to Mr and Mrs B as well.  
There was always going to be a delay in processing the cheque as it wasnt made 
out in line with the account names. TSB has apologised for the distress and 
inconvenience caused by this situation and paid Mr and Mrs B £25. Im satisfied £25 
reflects the impact of the delay in highlighting the cheque wasnt completed in line 
with the account names and that TSB dealt with Mr and Mrs Bs complaint fairly.
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision before 28 May 2020.
