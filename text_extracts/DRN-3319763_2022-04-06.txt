The complaint
Mr H is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) wont refund payments he 
made as part of a scam.
What happened
Mr H says that in December 2020, he was contacted by someone recommending that he 
invest in crypto currency. Mr H says as a result he set up an e-money account in his name 
with a crypto currency firm - Ill refer to as A. Mr H initially made a payment of £200 from his 
NatWest account to his account with A, and in January 2021 a further payment of £4,400 
was made.
Mr H says hes unsure whether he made the payment of £4,400 or whether it was made by 
someone without his knowledge. However, when he noticed the transaction around six 
weeks later, he reported it to NatWest as fraud. Mr H says he saw the funds had gone via 
his account with A and were invested, but when he tried to withdraw the funds was unable to 
do so. 
Mr H feels NatWest should refund him for the payments as A is not a regulated company 
and NatWest shouldve identified this and prevented the payments from being made. Mr H 
refers to a text message he got from NatWest in July 2021, which says there is 
uncertainty around A in the UK and goes on to say well be declining all credit and 
debit card payments to them until further notice . Mr H says this shows NatWest was 
aware that A wasnt regulated at the time the payments were made from his account and 
therefore his payments shouldve been prevented.
NatWest investigated Mr Hs fraud claim and declined to refund him. NatWest said both of 
the payments were made with Mr Hs debit card, and that due to previous fraud claims on  
Mr Hs account they wouldnt be refunding him.
Mr H wasnt happy with NatWests response, so he brought a complaint to our service 
focusing on the payment of £4,400.
An investigator looked into Mr Hs complaint and didnt uphold it. They explained that the 
payment of £4,400 wasnt unusual or out of character based on Mr Hs previous account use 
 so they wouldnt have expected NatWest to intervene before processing it. And, as Mr Hs 
card didnt leave his possession, it was most likely Mr H had made the payment himself.
Mr H disagreed with the investigators opinion, saying NatWest should be held liable as A is 
a fraudulent unregulated company.
As Mr H disagreed, the case was passed to me to review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, regulators rules and guidance, relevant codes of 
practice and good industry practice at the time.
 
Generally, NatWest can hold Mr H liable for the disputed transaction of £4,400 if the 
evidence suggests its more likely than not that he made or authorised the transaction 
himself. The evidence provided shows that Mr Hs debit card details were used to make the 
£4,400 (as well as the £200) payment to A.  And based on what Mr H has told us, I think its 
most likely that he made the £4,400 payment himself for the following reasons:
The funds went to Mr Hs account hed set up with A, whereas I think a fraudster 
wouldve sent the funds to an account in their name, so they were guaranteed theyd 
have access to them. Mr H couldve noticed the transaction on either account and 
blocked it at any time
The transaction didnt utilise the full balance in Mr Hs NatWest account. I think its 
unlikely that a fraudster would leave a balance of around £4,000 in Mr Hs NatWest 
account. 
 Mr H says hes unsure whether he made the £4,400 payment himself  so hes not 
sure that the payment wasnt made by him
As Mr H says the card didnt leave his possession, I can see no explanation for how 
someone got hold of Mr Hs card, used it, and returned it to his possession  without 
Mr H noticing.
On that basis, I think Mr H authorised the payment and as such NatWest can hold him liable. 
Should NatWest have prevented the payments?
However, Ive gone on to consider whether NatWest shouldve intervened and prevented 
either payment from being made.
Having reviewed Mr Hs previous account use, I can see that in the preceding months he 
had made payments for a similar amount as the larger payment in question of £4,400. Mr H 
had used his card to make two payments, one of £5,000 and one of £2,400. Also, hed had 
payments debit his account for £4,000 and £5,700 separately. Having considered Mr Hs 
previous account use, Im not satisfied that the payments he made of £200 and £4,400 were 
particularly unusual or out of character. Because of that, I wouldnt have expected NatWest 
to identify them as potentially suspicious or expect them to have intervened or prevented the 
payments from leaving Mr Hs account.
Mr H has referred to a text message he got from NatWest nearly six months after making the 
second payment, which refers to uncertainty around A and advising that NatWest would be 
temporarily declining all credit and debit card payments to them. However, this wasnt in 
place at the time Mr H made his payments and Im not satisfied its fair to apply this 
retrospectively to the payments he made. 
The fact that A is unregulated doesnt mean that I would expect NatWest to automatically 
block any payments to it. If either of Mr Hs payments had been unusual and out of 
character, then I wouldve expected NatWest to contact Mr H to discuss them  however 
thats not the case here for the reasons already given. 
Having carefully considered everything Mr H has told us, I cant fairly ask NatWest to refund 
him.My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 May 2022.
