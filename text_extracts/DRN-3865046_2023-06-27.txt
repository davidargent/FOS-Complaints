The complaint
A company which Ill call G complains that WorldPay (UK) Ltd unfairly closed their account 
without giving them the opportunity to defend chargeback claims against them.
The complaint is brought on Gs behalf by their director, Mr D. 
What happened
G had an agreement with WorldPay for it to provide payment services to the company.
G told us:
In August 2021, they identified WorldPay had started debiting large amounts from 
their account without authorisation. They contacted WorldPay who said this was due 
to chargebacks it had received.
They had previously been notified of chargebacks by post and then provided the 
relevant documents for WorldPay to defend against them, but they hadnt received 
notification for any of these transactions. 
WorldPay said the chargebacks were now notified via the online portal, but they 
hadnt been made aware of this change and therefore couldnt provide a defense.
They had raised concerns with their bank about WorldPays actions and had to 
cancel their direct debit to the provider as it was taking money for goods that had 
already been provided.  
In December 2021, WorldPay gave them 60 days notice that it was withdrawing their 
facility and said that they owed it £20,000 which needed to be paid. WorldPay have 
now passed the debt to a debt collection agency which is unfair.
WorldPay told us G had raised two complaints with it. It said the first complaint Final 
Response Letter had been on 18 November 2021 regarding liability for chargebacks, how G 
was notified about chargebacks, and their chargeback process. These complaint points had 
been brought to our service in June 2022 - outside the required six-month timeframe for us 
to consider the complaint - so it didnt consent to us looking at these complaint points. 
For the second complaint which had been raised in January 2022, WorldPay agreed this had 
been brought to the service in time. 
WorldPay told us:
It was within the terms and conditions that its services could be cancelled provided 
60 days notice had been given  and G had been given the required notification that 
their account would be closed in early February.  
When a chargeback was raised, a letter was sent to G and confirmation was also 
uploaded to its dashboard advising that if they wished to dispute the chargeback, 
they would need to provide evidence within 10 days. If the evidence wasnt provided 
within this timescale, the chargeback would be deemed as valid. 
Our investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. She said that WorldPay had 
acted in line with the agreement terms when cancelling Gs contract with two months notice 
after it had received a large, and increasing, number of chargebacks. She also thought it 
was reasonable that WorldPay had requested G reimburse it for chargebacks that had 
occurred after the agreement had been cancelled. This was because the transactions had 
taken place before Gs agreement had been cancelled and so its actions were in line with 
the terms of the agreement. 
G didnt agree. They said as WorldPay had closed their account, they werent notified of 
chargebacks and therefore couldnt defend against them - even though they were fraudulent. 
So they asked for an ombudsman to review their complaint and the case has been passed to 
me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, I need to decide exactly what Gs complaint is, and what I can consider. I think G has 
made two separate complaints here:
In November 2021, G complained that WorldPay had changed its chargeback 
process, not given them notification of chargebacks made against them and unfairly 
liable for the chargebacks. 
In January 2022, G complained that WorldPay was unfairly cancelling their 
agreement without giving them a reason and hadnt confirmed how their chargebacks 
had been processed, many of which were fraudulent. 
The extent of my powers to consider complaints is set by the industry regulator the Financial 
Conduct Authority (the FCA), in the Dispute Resolution (DISP) rules. 
One of our rules, DISP 2.8.2R says: The Ombudsman cannot consider a complaint if the 
complainant refers it to the Financial Ombudsman Service: 
(1) more than six months after the date on which the respondent sent the complainant its 
final response;  unless 
(3) in the view of the Ombudsman, the failure to comply with the time limits [above] was as a 
result of exceptional circumstances; or  
(5) the respondent has consented to the Ombudsman considering the complaint where the 
time limits [above] have expired.
Therefore, I think Gs first complaint was brought out of time and WorldPay hasnt consented 
to our considering those complaint points. Ive seen no evidence that exceptional 
circumstances prevented G from referring their first complaint in time. However Im satisfied 
we can consider Gs second complaint so my decision will focus on those complaint points. 
G told us that its unhappy with how WorldPay processed the chargebacks against them  
many of which they say are fraudulent. But I need to make it clear that I can only consider 
Gs dispute with WorldPay, not Gs customers and what actions should be taken in regard to 
them. I can only look at whether WorldPay has treated G fairly and reasonably in line with 
the Scheme rules. WorldPay dont operate the Scheme or decide if a chargeback is 
successful  it can only decide whether or not to defend it. I understand this is frustrating for 
G, but chargebacks are decided based on the card scheme rules not the merits of any dispute between the cardholder (and whether or not they were the ones who received the 
goods) and the merchant.
There are limitations to the checks that WorldPay could undertake when faced with a 
chargeback, and from what Ive seen these are in line with other merchant services 
providers. I think G ought reasonably to have been aware that there would be a higher level 
of risk when taking a payment where a customer isnt physically present. I also cant fairly 
hold WorldPay responsible for the action of the persons who have committed the fraud. 
I recognise G is unhappy that WorldPay hasnt given them an explanation for its decision to 
cancel their agreement. However, it isnt obligated to do so. A payment service provider is 
able to decide not to continue to undertake business with a customer (provided it has given 
the required notice or has a valid reason to cancel the contract with immediate effect) in the 
same way that customer can choose to move to another provider. 
The terms of Gs agreement with WorldPay say that it can terminate the contract with them, 
providing it gives them 60 days notice. I can see that WorldPay wrote to G on 3 December 
2021 to say that it was giving notice that the contract would be cancelled on 7 February 
2022. So its met its obligation here. 
G also says that they continued to receive chargebacks after their contract was cancelled 
which meant they couldnt defend against them, and they now owe WorldPay £20,000 which 
is unfair. However, Gs agreement with WorldPay says that chargebacks can happen a 
considerable period of time after transaction took place and that they agreed that WorldPay 
could recover any chargebacks and chargeback costs from them if the transactions took 
place during the term of the agreement. 
WorldPay has provided a breakdown of the transactions for which the chargebacks and 
associated costs were raised after the agreement had been cancelled on 7 February 2022, 
and Ive seen evidence that these were as a result of transactions which took place before 
this date and during the term of Gs active agreement with WorldPay. Ive also seen that 
WorldPay sent letters to G about each of these chargebacks to make them aware they had 
been raised. So I cant reasonably say WorldPay has done anything wrong by requesting 
that G reimburse it for these payments. 
I recognise that this has been a difficult time for G and that theyll be disappointed with my 
decision. However, I dont think WorldPay did anything wrong, so I wont be asking it to 
refund the chargebacks that it is now liable for or reinstate their service agreement. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask G to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2023.
