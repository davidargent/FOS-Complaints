DRN-4144574
The complaint
M, a small business has complained about the service that PrePay Technologies Limited 
has provided in regard to him accessing funds from his account.
What happened
The details of the complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead, I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the investigators findings for broadly the same reasons. I will 
explain why.
Its not in dispute that PrePay didnt deliver the level of service it strives to provide, as it 
explained this in its final response letter and offered M £200 compensation. 
As such, the only thing for me to decide is whether the offer PrePay made was fair and 
reasonable. Having considered the circumstances of the complaint, I am not persuaded it is. 
I say this because, the matter still hasnt been resolved and has gone on for some time 
causing detriment to M. M has still not received the funds from the account in question. Our 
investigator explained that M has been impacted by this as it hasnt had access to the funds 
since 2021. As such, she felt a further award of £150 was fair given the fact there had been 
a financial impact on M and inconvenience caused to the director of M. 
However, PrePay didnt agree, as it felt that the director of M wasnt entirely cooperative 
when it came to communicating with the team that was handling the case. It went on to say 
that it could have been resolved quicker if the director had done this. However, I disagree. 
While I accept at times there were delays caused by the director of M, I am not persuaded 
that without this delay the matter would have been resolved. I say this because, even at this 
stage, the funds still havent been transferred to M. And while PrePay continues to say the  
Director of M hasnt transferred the funds while the account is on pause, I have seen 
evidence to show that the Director of M has sent correspondence stating he was having 
difficulties doing so.
I have then gone on to consider PrePays letter dated 20 September 2022 which says: 
Alternatively, if you can provide alternative bank details in your name, along with statement 
dated within the last 3 months, I can arrange a transfer of the funds for you. Please let me 
know which option you would prefer, and Ill assist accordingly
So, PrePay had the ability to do the transfer, was aware the Director of M was struggling to 
complete the transfer, received Ms account details and PrePay still failed to arrange the 
transfer. 
PrePay has since said the reason the transfer hasnt been completed is due to M not 
providing a bank statement of the account he wishes the funds to be transferred to. And 
while I can see that this was originally requested in its final response letter, the Director of M 
has continued to query why he hasnt received the funds. I cant see any correspondence 
from PrePay to explain this to the Director. So, while I understand PrePay feels the Director 
of M didnt mitigate his inconvenience by cooperating (which I have considered), PrePay has 
continued to cause unnecessary delays by not communicating, which continues to impact M. 
So, with that in mind, I think the further £150 recommended by our investigator for the 
inconvenience PrePay has caused is fair and reasonable. Bringing the total offer to £350.
Putting things right
Our investigator has requested that the Director of M provides a bank statement (of the 
account he wishes the funds to be transferred to) to PrePay. Once PrePay has received this 
it must arrange for Ms funds to be transferred to the account which M specified. PrePay 
must pay M a further £150 bringing the total award for inconvenience caused to £350. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require PrePay Technologies Limited to arrange for the funds to 
be transferred to the account in which M specified and pay a further £150 for the 
inconvenience it caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask I to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 July 2023.
