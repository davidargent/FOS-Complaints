K821x#15complaint
Mr S complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called Touchdown 
Associates Limited,  trading at the time under the Cash Converters network of stores. Mr S 
says he was lent to irresponsibly  and the loans  caused him financial problems. To keep 
things simple Ill refer mainly to Touchdown  throughout  this decision.
background
We now know that Mr S took out 11 short-term loans from Touchdown  between  November 
2014 and July 2016. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Ss borrowing, based  on the information 
provided to us. This can be found  in the appendix  at the end of this decision. 
Its important to note, however, that Mr S had been previously lent to around 27 times  by 
another company, but still under the Cash Converters  network.  Touchdown isnt responsible 
for that previous lending chain, but we do know that it had access  to all the information 
about Mr S and the Cash Converters lending history via the network. This is an important 
and relevant factor which Ill refer to later.
One of our adjudicators looked  into this complaint  and said they thought it should be upheld; 
they thought all 11 loans with Touchdown shouldnt have been provided.  Touchdown  didnt 
agree with this and said it hadnt done anything  wrong, so Im making a final decision. 
Im sorry  its taken  a while for the case to reach this final stage. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Ss 
complaint.
Touchdown needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr S could repay all the 11 loans  he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks  
ought to have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being  
lent, the total repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Touchdown should have  fairly and reasonably done  more to establish  that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Ref: DRN00155882the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Touchdown  was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr S could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Touchdown told us it carried out certain  affordability  and credit checks before agreeing to 
lend to Mr S. Ive thought about  this and Ive also looked at the overall pattern of lending 
history with a view to seeing if there was a point  at which Touchdown should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  Ive considered 
whether, at some point,  Touchdown  should  have realised that it shouldnt have provided  any 
further loans.  
Having done this, I actually think the overall  pattern of repeated  lending  from the point  of 
loan 1 onwards  should  have caused Touchdown to see that it shouldnt have provided  any 
loans at all to Mr S. 
This is because, as Ive said above,  Touchdown already fully knew about the 27 previous  
short-term loans Mr S had been given through the Cash Converters network.  Of these 
loans, I note there was a fairly large break  in the chain of lending  (13 months)  between  loan 
numbers 19  20, so Ill take that into account. But after that, there were 7 more  consecutive 
loans in 5 months  and the last one was still outstanding when Mr S was given the first loan in 
the Touchdown  chain.
In short  - when Touchdown lent Mr S the first loan, in November 2014, it was the eighth 
short-term, high interest loan hed been provided with in 6 months. Touchdown knew this 
when it lent him the money, but it went on continuously lending to him until mid-2016.
Our adjudicator pointed  this out, but it seems to me that Touchdown  has comprehensively 
failed to understand its responsibility. Firstly, I note in its replies to us about Mr Ss 
complaint, Touchdown comments widely on the type of spending Mr S undertook.  It also 
comments on what it calls his lifestyle and makes what  I consider to be uninformed  and out 
of context judgements  on various items Mr S spent money on. In my view, these comments 
have no bearing  at all on whether  or not it was right to advance him the loans in question. 
As such,  I think it would  therefore be helpful  to remind Touchdown that as the lender, it is the 
regulated party here - not Mr S. And as far as I can see, the loans it advanced  to him came 
with no conditions about what he could spend the money on.
Ref: DRN00155883The other main response relates to affordability. Touchdown comments  on Mr Ss steady 
income and his apparent ability to repay the loans. Of course,  Ive taken this into account, 
but once again this somewhat one-dimensional  approach fails to consider the regulations  
under which this type of lending is allowed. 
For example, at the very beginning  of its lending, Touchdown could very easily  see that Mr S 
was having to consistently take out high interest,  short-term lending over a sustained period. 
The indebtedness caused  by this type of borrowing was quite obviously harmful, in my view. 
All 11 loans  had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing  him to take 
very expensive credit  intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period. Also,  the 
length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely to have had negative  implications  on his 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
Any reasonable assessment of the information Touchdown had at the time should have 
caused it to have realised Mr S was at risk of not managing  to repay  the loans sustainably  or 
getting into financial difficulties. So Im upholding this complaint in full, in respect  of loans 1 -
11. Touchdown  repeatedly lent to Mr S in an unsustainable manner.
 
putting things right  what Touchdown needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 1 - 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement
all 11 loans mean any information recorded  about them  is adverse. So all entries 
about loans 1 - 11 should be completely removed  from Mr Ss credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Touchdown  to take off tax from this interest. Touchdown must give Mr S a 
certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I fully uphold Mr Ss complaint.  Touchdown Associates Limited 
should put things right for Mr S as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 May 2020.
