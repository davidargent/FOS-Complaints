Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be upheld in respect of loans 3 to 9. She 
thought Sunny should have undertaken more  checks  from loan 3. She said if it had done so, 
it would  have seen  that Mr O had difficulty managing his money. She thought  the pattern of 
lending from loan 6 showed that he had become reliant on short term loans and the pattern  
of lending showed his borrowing was unsustainable.  
Sunny disagreed with that view.  It said it offered customers the chance to have  four loans at 
once to give them greater  personal choice. I believed that Mr O had to pay on average  
6.38% of his monthly income towards his borrowing. It noted  that our adjudicator  said Mr O 
was making regular payments to online gambling  sites but said that was his personal choice. 
Sunny said that gambling transactions were completely irrelevant to the complaint. Sunny 
said that as Mr O had repaid all of his loans without any record  of detriment and so the 
repayments must have  been sustainable.  
As the parties are not in agreement with our adjudicator, the matter has been  passed to me 
to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr O could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
Ref: DRN05651552different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr O could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Os complaint.
As I said above, our adjudicator didnt think the complaint should be upheld for loans 1 and 
2. Mr O did not dispute what our adjudicator said about that borrowing. So, I have not 
considered whether Sunny irresponsibly lent loans  1 and 2 any further. 
I think our adjudicator was right when she said that Sunny should have carried  out further 
checks at loan 3. In January 2017, Mr O had taken  out a fairly  significant  loan of £700. He 
had taken out another loan of £100  shortly afterwards. Loan 3 was the third loan he had 
applied for within two months and if agreed, meant he would have borrowed £900 during that 
time. 
I think the timing of the application for loan 3 is important. Mr O applied  for this loan a matter 
of days after hed made a repayment  of over £200  towards loans 1 and 2. With that in mind, I 
think it should have  reasonably appeared to Sunny that Mr O had applied for that extra 
borrowing to plug a hole in his finances  caused by repaying loans 1 and 2. It raised 
questions about  whether  he was able meet his existing repayments.  At that point,  Sunny 
Ref: DRN05651553should have done further checks  and conducted  a full review of Mr Os financial 
circumstances. 
Had that full review been carried out, I think Sunny would have seen that a significant portion 
of Mr Os income was being  spent  on online  gambling transactions. Most  of the transactions  
on his bank statements  were for online betting  sites. A proportionate check  would have 
shown Sunny that Mr O was probably struggling financially. And at that stage, Sunny would 
have realised that he could not sustainably repay  loan 3. The same is true for loans 4 and 5. 
I can see that in its response  to our adjudicator, Sunny said that the gambling transactions 
Mr O made  were  completely irrelevant to the complaint. I disagree. As I said above,  the 
question Sunny needed to ask itself was whether  Mr O could sustainably  repay  his loans. As 
he was spending  hundreds of pounds each month with online bookmakers, that spending 
clearly has an impact  on how he can sustainably  afford his repayments. Ignoring  a 
significant feature  of the way Mr O manages  his finances is not responsible lending. 
Ive also thought about what  Sunny said about the proportion of income  that Mr O would 
have been required  to spend on his monthly  repayments. Sunny estimated that figure  to be 
in the region of 6%. By the time Mr O applied  for loan 3 and taking  account  of the 
repayments he would have to make for all three  loans at the same  time, he would have been 
spending over 20% of his income  on his Sunny loan repayments. That figure alone is not 
substantial. But when put into context  alongside Mr Os gambling transactions,  I agree with 
our adjudicator that a proportionate check would have  shown Sunny that Mr O could not 
sustainably repay  loans 3 to 5. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr O with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which it should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. If that was the case, Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Os case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr O was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr O had taken out six loans in around six months. So Sunny ought  to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr O was having  to borrow  further to cover 
the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Os 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr O frequently borrowed £100.  Sunny ought  to have known that he was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
As I said above, Sunny told us that it allowed a customer to have four loans running 
simultaneously. I can see that when  Mr Os borrowing reduced to three loans, he 
would take out a fourth that same day. 
I think that Mr O lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Os indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN05651554the number  of loans which Mr O borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him/her  in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 3 to 5 and loans 6 to 9 and Sunny should 
put things right.
putting things right  what  Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr O paid on loans 3 to 9. 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 to 5 from Mr Os credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 9 should be removed from Mr 
Os credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr Os complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited must  put things right for Mr O as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2020.
