The complaint
Mr G is unhappy about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA not defending his chargeback case 
correctly. He feels that PayPal should not have refunded the buyer. 
To resolve the matter, Mr G would like the full amount of £955 refunded back to him and 
compensation for the trouble and upset that this matter has caused. 
What happened
Mr G runs a business, he sold a bespoke item to a buyer who paid £955 by Visa. He advises 
that many photos of the item and a detailed list were sent to the buyer before the sale was 
complete. Once the funds were exchanged a chargeback request was made by the buyer. At 
this point, PayPal attempted to defend the case by giving the card issuer the original sales 
invoice and a photo of the item.  
Mr G has also explained that PayPal had assured him that the money would be returned to 
him as the item was bespoke. Whilst PayPal have been unable to provide us with the call 
recording, I have no reason to believe that this conversation did not take place. According to 
PayPal, the outcome of the investigation was not in favour of Mr G based on the item being 
significantly not as described from its description. 
Mr G disputes this conclusion, saying it was made to order for the buyer. Mr G also adds that 
the buyer indicated that he simply did not want the product and therefore the reasoning for 
the chargeback would be incorrect. PayPal accepted the decision of the card issuer on the 
basis that the card issuer, not us, determines whether the payer is successful when they 
pursue a chargeback (Reversals section of PayPal agreement). 
As PayPal accepted the card issuer decision, they were unable to cover Mr G under the 
Seller Protection Policy because the chargeback reason for goods that are significantly not 
as described are not covered under the policy. Mr G was left with no item and the sum of 
£955 was not returned to him.
Mr G felt he was correctly owed this sum and that he had followed the correct procedure, he 
also felt let down by PayPal as they had given him a false sense of hope. Mr G continues to 
claim that PayPal could have done more in order to defend the chargeback. 
One of our investigators here looked at this complaint and felt that PayPal did not present all 
the facts in defence of the chargeback and had these facts been put forward, Mr G had a 
reasonable chance of success in the outcome of the chargeback investigation. Mr G 
accepted the view, but PayPal disagreed, they continue to defend their actions and 
requested for an Ombudsman to review the case.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the view made by our investigator on 14 July 2020 and have 
decided that this complaint should be upheld against PayPal.
A chargeback is the process where disputes are resolved between card issuers and 
merchant acquirers. The chargeback scheme may be used to try and resolve the problem 
where the goods were not as described. The card issuer checks the nature of the problem 
and the evidence to see whether they can make a successful claim. The merchant can 
explain why the chargeback should not go through, they can defend themselves and provide 
relevant document like correspondence, receipts and specific details of the goods etc. 
Although PayPal seem to have taken some steps in terms of the procedure, I cant be 
satisfied they dealt with the chargeback issue properly. They have not, for example, 
demonstrated that they responded to the chargeback with Mr Gs evidence that the goods 
did conform to their description. I recognise that a chargeback attempt does not guarantee 
money to be recovered for the seller, providers such as PayPal should allow their merchants 
the opportunity to defend the chargeback case, this is good practice. 
I would have expected PayPal to have submitted more information to the card issuer 
company in order to defend Mr G. The image that PayPal sent to the card issuer only shows 
the item and the sales invoice does not provide any information that would explain that the 
item was bespoke. 
PayPal could have also approached Mr G to provide more information in order to defend the 
case if they needed to. Mr G claims that he had already made PayPal aware that the item 
was bespoke and therefore if this was presented to the card issuer it could have potentially 
changed the outcome of the chargeback investigation. 
As this did not happen, I believe PayPal could have done more to help Mr G and have acted 
unfairly on this occasion. It is also reasonable to say that PayPal should not have led Mr G to 
believe that the funds would be returned to him. When this did not happen, PayPal 
suggested that Mr G may have been incorrectly advised. This would indicate that Mr G also 
had an element of poor customer service from PayPal. 
To conclude, I accept PayPal isnt the ultimate arbiter of the chargeback process. That is the 
role of the card scheme (though not the card issuer). But the card scheme rules permit 
PayPal to submit evidence to dispute the chargeback, and I consider it could and should 
have done rather more than it did. If it had done so, the evidence provided to me suggests 
the chargeback might well have been resolved in Mr Gs favour.
Putting things right
In summary, I agree with the investigators remedy and consider PayPal should do the 
following: 
1) Refund Mr G the full amount of the transaction which amounts to £955. 
2) Pay simple interest of 8% per year on this amount from the date it was debited to Mr 
Gs account, until the date the funds are returned to Mr G. For any avoidance of 
doubt, this is because Mr G was without the use of these funds. 
3) Pay Mr G £150 for the trouble and upset that this matter has caused. 
My final decisionMy final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA. 
To resolve matters, PayPal must now take the steps Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 December 2020.
