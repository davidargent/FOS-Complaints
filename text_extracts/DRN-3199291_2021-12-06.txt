The complaint
Mrs B has complained that TW Financial Planning Ltd didnt provide appropriate advice
when the Lifetime Allowance (LTA) reduced in 2014.
What happened
Ive considered this complaint before. I issued a provisional decision on 9 November 2021. 
Heres what I said about what had happened and my provisional findings:
Mrs B had been a client of TW Financial Planning Ltd since 2006. She had deferred 
benefits in three former employers final salary pension schemes. She also had a personal 
pension arrangement (a collective retirement account or CRA) with Skandia (which later 
become Old Mutual) into which she made ad hoc and regular contributions. She became a 
member of her new employers final salary pension scheme on 1 November 2013.
During the time Mrs B was a client of TW Financial Planning Ltd, the LTA increased from
£1.5 million to £1.8 million in the tax years 2010/11 and 2011/12. In late 2010 reductions to 
the LTA were announced. The LTA reduced to £1.5 million with effect from 6 April 2012. It 
was to reduce further to £1.25 million from 6 April 2014. Protections were available to 
maintain a higher LTA for qualifying individuals.
Mrs Bs employer wrote to her in February 2014. Amongst other things the letter said 
the LTA was reducing to £1.25 million from 6 April 2014. Some estimates for her 
employers pension scheme were included. But Mrs B needed to include the value of 
all her pension savings in other UK registered pension schemes.
It was estimated, if Mrs B stayed in her employers scheme until her normal retirement age 
(NRA), her benefits would be 46% of the LTA, based on the assumptions set out (which 
included that the LTA remained unchanged at £1.25 million until Mrs Bs NRA). If she left the 
scheme on 5 April 2014 her deferred pension was estimated to be 1% of the LTA or 2% at 
NRA, assuming increases at 2.5% pa in deferment up to NRA. The letter mentioned the 
availability of Fixed Protection 2014 (FP 2014) and Individual Protection 2014 (IP 2014). And 
said it was difficult to estimate an individuals position in relation to the LTA so, if Mrs B was 
concerned, she should talk to a financial adviser.
Mrs B had a meeting with TW Financial Planning Ltd on 13 February 2014. I assume Mrs B 
showed the adviser the letter from her employer. In any event it seems the reduction to the 
LTA was mentioned  the advisers handwritten notes refer to it. I cant decipher all of 
whats written but the notes appear to say that new valuations/projections for Mrs Bs three 
deferred final salary pensions should be obtained. Theres no mention in the notes of 
protection and so its unclear if FP 2014 or IP 2014 was discussed.
TW Financial Planning Ltd issued a recommendation letter on 21 March 2014. Mrs B was 
advised to make a single contribution of £11,334.16 gross (£9,067.33 net) into her CRA to 
maximise her annual allowance for that tax year. The LTA is mentioned. The report says for 
the tax year 2013/2014 the LTA is £1.5 million but in 2014/2015 will reduce to £1.25 million. 
The report adds that protection is available (FP 2014) for those who expect their pension 
savings to be greater than £1.25 million when they take their benefits on or after 6 April 
2014 and will allow individuals meeting certain criteria to fix their LTA at £1.5 million rather 
than £1.25 million. The report adds: It will therefore be important for those with substantial 
pension funds to ensure they avoid breaching this ceiling.
TW Financial Planning proved Mrs B with a valuation on 16 February 2015. Excluding her 
then employers scheme, the total value of her pension benefits was £1,113,946.34. A letter 
from TW Financial Planning Ltd said the current LTA was £1.25 million, to be reduced to £1 
million from 6 April 2016. And the values of the various schemes (again not including Mrs 
Bs then employers scheme) totalled £1,145,609.
Mrs B became a deferred member of her employers pension scheme on 30 November 
2015. That was following advice from accountants instructed by Mrs Bs employer on 
behalf of its directors (which included Mrs B) who, I understand, were all in a similar 
position. The scope of the report was:
To assess Mrs Bs projected benefits, allowing for projected annual allowance 
and LTA charges based on retirement at NRA (age 62) and at 58 and 55 if Mrs 
B remained an active member of her employers scheme and also the projected 
position if she decided to opt out.
To assess the value of the cash alternative at the same dates, so that a 
comparison could be made of Mrs Bs overall position if she continued as an 
active member of the employers scheme compared to opting out and electing for 
the cash alternative. (I understand that the employer offered a cash payment if 
Mrs B opted out but I dont have full details.).
To consider whether Mrs B was eligible and would benefit from registering for IP 
2014 and/or FP 2016 or IP 2016 to protect a higher LTA than would otherwise 
apply
As a result, Mrs B applied for and obtained FP 2016 giving her a protected LTA of 
£1.25 million.
Mrs B complained to TW Financial Planning Ltd on 31 January 2020. TW Financial 
Planning Ltd didnt uphold the complaint. It said the accountants report had confirmed Mrs 
B wasnt eligible to apply for IP 2014.
Mrs B remained unhappy and referred her complaint to us. One of our investigators 
considered it. She didnt think, for the reasons she set out in her view dated 17 May 2021, 
that TW Financial Planning Ltd needed to do anything. In summary the investigator said, to 
apply for FP 2014, Mrs B couldnt have had any further accruals into her pension plans 
after 5 April 2014. As that wasnt the case, she couldnt have applied for FP 2014. And Mrs 
B wasnt eligible for IP 2014. Her pension entitlement for LTA purposes, taking into account 
that her benefits in her employers scheme were valued at £138,893 in October 2015, 
wasnt in excess of £1.25 million as at 6 April 2014.
That said, the investigator didnt think TW Financial Planning Ltd had given Mrs B enough 
information. On occasions, the value for Mrs Bs benefits in her current employers scheme 
hadnt been obtained, even though Mrs B was so close to the LTA limit. The investigator 
also said shed have preferred to have seen TW Financial Planning Ltd conduct its own 
calculations, rather than relying on information from a third party. But, as Mrs B couldnt 
have applied for FP 2014 or IP 2014, the investigator didnt think TW Financial Planning Ltd 
was responsible and to the extent that any tax liability could be considered a financial loss.
In response Mrs B queried why valuations hadnt been obtained immediately following the 
meeting in February 2014. She couldve been advised to stop making contributions into the employers scheme in March 2014. The overall value of her pensions was £1.235 million at 
that point and so wouldve been expected to exceed £1.25 million even if there was only a 
small uplift in the value of her CRA.
The investigator asked TW Financial Planning Ltd why FP 2014 wasnt applied for. TW 
Financial Planning Ltd referred to what the investigator had said in her view. As a member 
of her current employers final salary scheme with significant employer contributions, Mrs B 
didnt have a choice of applying or not. To apply for FP 2014 no further accruals wouldve 
been permitted after 5 April 2014. Mrs B couldnt have applied for FP 2014.
As agreement couldnt be reached the complaint was referred to me to decide. I thought the 
issue wasnt so much whether Mrs B was precluded from applying for FP 2014 because 
she was still a member of her current employers scheme but whether she shouldve been 
applied to cease her active membership of that scheme from March 2014 so that further 
contributions wouldnt be made, allowing her to apply for FP 2014. That wouldve given her 
a LTA of £1.5 million, instead of the LTA of £1.25 million she secured by obtaining FP 2016.
I noted that Mrs B had been advised (by the accountants instructed by her employer 
rather than TW Financial Planning Ltd) to give up her membership of her current 
employers scheme from the end of November 2015. I needed to understand if that 
advice shouldve been given earlier, allowing Mrs B to apply for FP 2014.
In response TW Financial Planning Ltd said that, in March 2014, it didnt know:
The LTA would further reduce to £1 million from April 2016;
Thered be an annual allowance from April 2016 which meant an income tax 
charge on employer or employee contributions totaling more than £10,000;
Mrs Bs employer would offer a cash alternative to senior staff if they opted out of 
the employers scheme.
TW Financial Planning Ltd said it was a combination of those factors which resulted in the 
accountants instructed by Mrs Bs employer to draw a different conclusion. In particular 
the introduction of the annual allowance was impacting on the immediate net income of 
all higher paid staff, whatever their LTA situation.
In 2014 opting out of the employers scheme wasnt best advice. Mrs B wouldve forgone 
her future pension entitlement, estimated by the accountants as £28,587 at NRA (62). The 
value for LTA purposes was £571,740. Mrs B wouldve made contributions of 11% of 
£138,000 less 45% tax. Factoring in 2% annual inflation gives a net cost of £91,410 over 
ten years to age 62. Opting out of pension rights worth £480,320 net couldnt be seen as 
best advice. Mrs Bs focus was on reducing her income tax liabilities. Even with a LTA 
charge pensions relieved at 45% could still be beneficial. But that changed with the 
introduction of the annual allowance.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear, from the advisers notes of his meeting with Mrs B on 13 February 2014, that he 
was aware the LTA was to be reduced. And the recommendation letter dated 21 March 
2014 also refers to the reduction of the LTA to £1.25 million and to the availability of FP 
2014 to maintain a LTA of £1.5 million. Theres also comment about the need for those with substantial pension funds  and I think Mrs B meets that description  to ensure they avoid 
breaching the LTA.
But theres nothing about Mrs Bs specific position. The report doesnt indicate that up to 
date valuations have been obtained for all her pension arrangements (including her current 
employers scheme), even though it appears that was identified as necessary at the 
meeting on 13 February 2014. Nor does it appear that any analysis of Mrs Bs position in 
relation to the LTA and the forthcoming reduction had been undertaken and any view 
reached as to whether she might need to apply for protection.
Mrs B says, and I agree, that TW Financial Planning Ltd shouldve given her that advice. I 
think its clear from the advisers notes, that he knew that there might be LTA implications 
for Mrs B and that her situation needed to be looked into. I find it difficult to understand why 
that wasnt done, especially as TW Financial Planning Ltd was advising Mrs B about 
making a further contribution to her CRA in order to maximise her annual allowance.
The upshot was that Mrs B didnt apply for protection in 2014. I need to consider if she 
shouldve been applied to apply for FP 2014. Ive said FP 2014 because I agree she 
wasnt eligible for IP 2014. It was available to those who had pension benefits worth in 
excess of £1.25 million as at 5 April 2014. It allowed further contributions and further 
pension benefits to be accrued. But any benefits in excess of those as at 5 April 2014 (up 
to a maximum of £1.5 million or the standard LTA if higher) would be liable to a LTA 
charge. Mrs Bs benefits as at 5 April 2014 were less than £1.25 million so it wasnt open 
to her to apply for IP 2014.
Mrs B says she should have been told to apply for FP 2014. I understand what the 
investigator said about it not being open to Mrs B to apply as she was an active member of 
her current employers scheme. But the point is whether she shouldve been best advised 
to cease her membership so shed qualify for FP 2014 and retain a LTA of £1.5 million, 
instead of the LTA of £1.25 she has by virtue of IP 2016.
Mrs B wouldve had to apply for FP 2014 by 5 April 2014. Contributions to her current 
employers scheme had to cease before 6 April 2014. Unlike IP 2014 there was no 
minimum benefit value needed to apply for FP 2014.
Mrs B says shed have been better off by having a higher LTA - £1.5 million instead of
£1.25million. She says it was predictable that, even with conservative growth on her CRA, 
by the time she retires her pension savings will exceed £1.25 million, meaning that shell 
pay a LTA charge on the excess (55% if the benefits in excess of the LTA are taken as a 
lump sum and 25% if taken as income). I can see that. But, as Ive said, in order to secure 
FP 2014, Mrs B wouldve given up her active membership of her employers scheme. And 
so shed have foregone the contributions that her employer was paying into the scheme on 
her behalf. And being a member of the employers scheme might have meant other 
benefits, such as death in service benefits and ill health early retirement enhancement. So, 
even though Mrs B would suffer a LTA charge on the excess benefits, she might still be 
better off overall.
TW Financial Planning Ltd has said that it would take some very unusual circumstances 
that would warrant Mrs B not joining her employers scheme and nothing was apparent 
from its knowledge of her situation that wouldve led to it advising her to leave the scheme 
in connection with FP 2014. I dont disagree  as Ive said above it is often inappropriate to 
advise someone to stop building up benefits in an employers pension scheme, even 
though the value of those benefits will result in a LTA charge. Thats because the employer 
is likely to be paying for some or all of the benefits. But that wont always be the case. And TW Financial Planning Ltd doesnt appear, at the time, to have looked into Mrs Bs situation 
and exactly what her position was and advised her.
TW Financial Planning Ltd has supplied some calculations as to why FP 2014 wasnt 
applied for, showing the income tax and potential inheritance tax benefits of Mrs B 
continuing to be a member of her employers scheme. I note what Mrs B has said about 
those not being shared with her at the time and being put together later. As Ive said, I cant 
see that TW Financial Planning Ltd thought about Mrs Bs position at the time or carried out 
any calculations. But, if there are valid reasons why Mrs B wouldnt have been advised to 
give up active membership of her employers scheme and apply for FP 2014, she wont 
have lost out as a result of any failing by TW Financial Planning Ltd to consider her position. 
Mrs B may feel its unfair if TW Financial Planning Ltd didnt do something it shouldve 
done. But the point is whether shes suffered any loss as a result of any omission.
I was concerned that, according to TW Financial Planning Ltd, it wouldnt have been 
appropriate for Mrs B to apply for FP 2014. Yet, just the following year, as a result of the 
accountants report commissioned by her employer, Mrs B did give up active membership 
of her employers scheme so she could apply for FP 2016.
TW Financial Planning Ltd has said, in assessing what Mrs B shouldve been advised in 
2014, the position at the time, and what was known then, has to be considered. I agree. 
And TW Financial Planning Ltd says that things changed in 2015. Ive looked at the factors 
TW Financial Planning Ltd has pointed to and the timing of their introduction.
First was the further reduction to the LTA from £1.25 million to £1 million from 6 April 2016. 
That was announced in the March 2015 budget and confirmed in the 2015 Summer budget. 
Mrs Bs pension savings were more than £1 million so she was going to be directly 
impacted by the new lower LTA.
Secondly, the government also announced in the Summer 2015 budget that pensions tax 
relief would be cut for high earners and a tapered annual allowance introduced for those 
with adjusted income of over £150,000. The adjusted income meant that any pension 
contributions were added back in. Pensions tax relief would be restricted by a tapered 
reduction in the amount of the annual allowance for those with income (including the value 
of any pension contributions) of over £150,000 and an income (excluding pension 
contributions) in excess of £110,000. Again, my understanding is that Mrs B would be 
directly impacted by those measures.
Looking at the figures TW Financial Planning Ltd has provided, it seems that Mrs Bs 
position did change in consequence of those changes. Remaining in her employers 
pension scheme  which meant that she wouldnt qualify for FP 2016 and her LTA would 
be £1 million when her pension savings were considerably in excess of that amount  was 
no longer financially beneficial. And there was the added attraction of a financial incentive 
from Mrs Bs employer (a cash lump sum) if she opted out of her employers scheme.
It may be fortuitous that Mrs Bs employer instructed accountants when it did. Ive seen 
nothing to indicate that TW Financial Planning Ltd was proactive following the Summer 
2015 budget and contacted Mrs B about the changes and how they might impact her. But 
as a number of the employers staff were affected, if not by the reduction to the LTA, by the 
changes to the annual allowance, hence the employer instructed accountants who reported 
in October 2015 and Mrs B acted on the advice given.
From what Ive seen, I dont think Mrs B shouldve been advised to seek FP 2014. She did 
obtain FP 2016, even if that was on the advice of another party and not TW Financial 
Planning Ltd. In the circumstances I dont think shes suffered any loss and Im not makingany award despite any shortcomings in TW Financial Planning Ltds service.
TW Financial Planning Ltd said it accepted my provisional decision. Mrs B didnt comment 
further. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In the absence of any new information or arguments, my views remain as set out in my 
provisional decision and recapped above. For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding 
Mrs Bs complaint. 
My final decision
I dont uphold the complaint and Im not making any award. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2022.
