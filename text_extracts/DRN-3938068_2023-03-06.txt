The complaint
Mr T complains that PayrNet Limited blocked his account and withheld the money in it. Mr T 
would like his money back.
Mr T held a Rizq branded account  who provided services on behalf of PayrNet  but I will 
refer to Rizq as PayrNet in this decision.
What happened
In January 2021, PayrNet blocked Mr Ts account and held the money in it. Mr T said this 
money was to pay his bills and as he couldnt access it, it caused him to go into arrears.
Our investigator reviewed things and noted that PayrNets actions seemed appropriate up 
until around 13 February 2021. He asked PayrNet for information and evidence relating to 
their actions after 13 February 2021. Despite asking PayrNet for this on a number of 
occasions, our investigator didnt receive anything. So, he asked PayrNet to return the 
money held in Mr Ts account back to Mr T plus 8% statutory interest.
PayrNet didnt respond. Our investigator asked PayrNet again for evidence of their review, 
and asked them to respond to the view but they didnt respond.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive decided to uphold this complaint. And Ill explain why.
The crux of the issue here problem is I cant tell whether Mr T is entitled to the money held in 
his account as PayrNet havent shared even basic information. I respect that PayrNet has 
internal policies and processes to follow along with legal and regulatory obligations. But they 
are also aware of our rules.
DISP 3.5.2 states, amongst other things, that an Ombudsman can reach a decision on the 
basis of what has been supplied and take account of the failure by a complainant or a firm to 
provide information that an Ombudsman has requested; .
So, Ive considered Payrnets refusal/failure to provide information. Ive also considered the 
fact that PayrNet are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet its legal 
and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of new 
and existing relationships. That sometimes means they need to restrict customers accounts 
 either in full or partially while they carry out the review. I havent seen enough evidence to 
satisfy me that PayrNet was complying with their legal and regulatory obligations when they 
reviewed Mr Ts account. I also havent seen any evidence that PayrNet involved Mr T in the 
review by asking him appropriate questions such as proof of entitlement to the money in the 
account, or what the account was used for as example. So, I cant fairly say theyve acted 
appropriately.
It therefore follows that I think PayrNet should refund Mr T the full balance of the account if 
they havent already done so. I also dont think its reasonable that Mr T has been without his 
money for a long period of time. So, like our investigator, I think 8% simple interest should be 
paid on this amount.
Putting things right
Overall, based on the evidence received, I dont think PayrNet did enough to satisfy 
themselves that Mr T wasnt entitled to the money in the account  so I think they should 
refund him (if they havent already) as he is now at a loss. And I think adding interest to the 
amount they refund him fairly compensates Mr T for the loss of use of his money.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ts complaint. PayrNet Limited should do the following:
Refund Mr T the amount held in the account at the time it was reviewed if they 
havent already.
Calculate interest at 8% simple per year on the above amount. PayrNet should 
calculate this from the date they blocked the account up to the date they refund Mr T.
HM Revenue & Customs requires PayrNet Limited to withhold income tax from the 
above-mentioned interest. PayrNet should give Mr T a certificate showing how much 
is taken off if Mr T asks for one.
Mr T needs to provide an up to date statement (dated in the last three months) to allow 
PayrNet to make the settlement. PayrNet must pay the compensation within 28 days of the 
date Mr T provides the up to date statement.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 April 2023.
