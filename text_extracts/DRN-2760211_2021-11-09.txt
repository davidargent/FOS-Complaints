The complaint
S, a business operating as a sole trader, complains that WorldPay (UK) Limited held funds 
that it was due to receive causing financial loss and stress and inconvenience.
What happened
S has a merchant processing agreement with WorldPay. It took a card payment of over 
£12,500 on 29 April 2020. WorldPay recalled the money as it wanted to investigate the 
payment. And the money wasnt returned to S until 4 June 2020. S says this damaged the 
relationship with its client and affected future work of approximately £50,000.
WorldPay said that it had acted under the terms and conditions of its agreement with S. It 
had concerns about the size and nature of the payment given past transactions. It had asked 
its bank to recall this money from S bank. This would normally happen within 15 working 
days. It returned the money to S as soon as it had received it back. It said it wasnt 
responsible for any financial loss for S. Since the complaint was referred to this service it 
decided to pay S £400 in compensation for the inconvenience caused.
Our investigator didnt recommend that it do anything more. Hed seen evidence that 
WorldPay was chasing the return of this money. The return was dependent on S own bank. 
Here we could only look at the actions of WorldPay and he couldnt fairly say it was 
responsible for the delays. He thought that the compensation was reasonable.
S didnt agree, and the owner said that £400 wasnt sufficient to reflect what happened. Had 
S known then it would have been chasing its own bank. But WorldPay had told it that the 
funds should be received back within the 15 days. And no one was able to say what was 
going on and so S didnt have information for its client. This caused the owner additional 
stress.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I note that the arrangement was that WorldPay would settle payments processed for S to its 
bank account using the BACS system. It had some questions about this payment and wrote 
to S about this on 30 April 2020. It didnt use the correct updated email address, but also 
sent a letter. It decided to recall the payment on 1 May 2020 before it was credited to S 
bank account. S responded to its letter on 4 May 2020 and WorldPay says that it had 
completed its investigation and reactivated S account by 5 May 2020.
S explains that it called WorldPay on almost a daily basis about the payment. WorldPay says 
that it expected the money at the latest on 26 May 2020 taking into account the bank 
holidays in May 2020. It said it had been monitoring the account daily and that it escalated 
the matter. It told S that the money would be sent by CHAPS payment as soon as it was 
received back by its bank. It has shown that this happened on 4 June 2020.
I appreciate that S has described the process of WorldPay as archaic. Im afraid we dont 
have a role in reviewing or setting processes as we arent the regulator. The payment had 
been originated using the BACS system and I can see that it was recalled by WorldPay as it 
didnt credit S own bank account. WorldPay accepts that the delay here was beyond what it 
had agreed with its own bank and what was expected.
I need to decide if WorldPay ought to have paid the money to S earlier. I cant say on 
balance that the recall could have been avoided if it had used the correct email address for S 
given the limited period available to recall a payment. That recall had already been started 
before it had concluded its investigation. The information it has provided shows in my view 
that it made reasonable enquiries about the recall. Until it had the money back it would be at 
risk if it had paid this to S. It paid S as soon as it was refunded.
S has shown that it had a further potential business opportunity with its client and who told it 
on 27 May 2020 that it wanted this payment to be sorted out first. In June 2020 its client said 
that it had followed this up with a different business. I cant know if S would otherwise 
definitely had got all this potential further work but in any event Im not persuaded that I 
could fairly hold WorldPay responsible for S not doing so. 
WorldPay has now recognised that there was inconvenience to S, and I can see that the 
owner was distressed by what happened. It has offered and now paid S £400. I think that 
this was reasonable, and I know S will be disappointed when I say that I wont be requiring 
WorldPay to do anything more.  
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part in the sense that WorldPay (UK) Limited 
should pay S £400 as it has already now done.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask S to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2021.
