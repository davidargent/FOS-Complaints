The complaint
Mr C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc ("NatWest") blocked his credit card 
whilst he was abroad.
 
What happened
In June 2019 Mr C went on holiday abroad. He told NatWest  where he was going and the 
dates hed be away. And he's unhappy that despite this the bank blocked his credit card 
during his trip. 
NatWest sent Mr C a message asking him to confirm 3 recent purchases. And another 
message after he'd done so telling him that his credit card had now been unblocked. But Mr 
C says this wasnt the case and he had to call NatWests security team the next day. He 
says he found this difficult to arrange due to the time difference between his location and the 
U.K.
Mr C complained to NatWest about what had happened. It apologised for the inconvenience 
caused by the restriction placed on his card. But it said that whilst placing travel markers on 
an account may help to reduce the likelihood of a restriction being imposed, it doesn't 
guarantee it. It explained that it has checks in place for fraud prevention, and didn't feel it 
had done anything wrong. It also gave Mr C details of a 24-hour telephone number he could 
call if a similar thing happens again, and said it was happy to accept reverse call charges.
Mr C wasn't happy with this response so he brought his complaint to our service. He'd like 
NatWest to compensate him for the stress, inconvenience and embarrassment caused to 
him and his wife by the restrictions placed on his card.  He also wants NatWest to take steps 
to ensure similar issues aren't encountered by other credit card customers.
Our investigator considered what had happened but didn't think NatWest had done anything 
wrong. Whilst he recognised it can cause inconvenience, he felt its fraud prevention system 
had worked as it is designed   to protect customers. He also noted that NatWests terms 
and conditions do make it known that there may be times NatWest considers it necessary to 
refuse transactions.
Mr C didnt accept these findings. As hed told NatWest he was going abroad he feels there 
was no need for it to consider his transactions unusual and block them. So the case has 
been passed to me to decide.
 
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly I think it would be helpful for me to clarify that I dont have the power to ask a 
business to change its wider processes and procedures. That would fall under the remit of 
the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. Its my role to look at how NatWest has 
treated Mr C here as an individual consumer. And to consider whether it would be fair and 
reasonable for it to take any further action to resolve his complaint. 
I know Mr C will be very disappointed, but having looked at what happened  Ive reached 
similar conclusions to our investigator. And I wont be asking NatWest to do anything more. 
Ill explain why.
NatWest has shown us evidence that it blocked Mr Cs credit card at 9:44pm on 25 June 
2019. It says this was a fraud prevention measure. And when this happened its automated 
system contacted Mr C. 
Mr C confirmed by text message that recent transactions made using his card were genuine. 
And NatWest lifted the block at 9:52pm. However a further block was placed on his card 
shortly afterwards. I can see this second block was lifted after Mr C contacted NatWests 
security team on 26 June 2019.
Ive looked at the terms and conditions applicable to Mr Cs account, and I can see that they 
set out when NatWest may refuse a transaction, including if it has any concerns about fraud 
or unauthorised transactions. So Im satisfied NatWest is entitled to block payments if it has 
security concerns, and to take such measures as it considers necessary to protect its 
customers accounts. NatWest has also explained that its unusual for a customers card to 
be blocked twice in quick succession as was the case here, but that this can happen. 
Mr C took steps to tell NatWest about his travel plans in advance. So I can fully understand 
why hes so frustrated that restrictions were imposed on his credit card whilst he was away. 
He feels that as NatWest knew he was going abroad it shouldnt have considered his 
transactions to be unusual. 
NatWest has confirmed that a travel marker was placed on Mr Cs account on 15 June 2019. 
So Im satisfied it followed its usual process correctly here. Its also explained that although 
telling it about travel plans in advance helps to reduce the likelihood of restrictions being 
imposed on transactions, it doesnt guarantee that this wont happen. And I can see this is 
supported by the information provided on its website about registering a credit card for 
travel. So I dont think  the fact Mr C had notified it of it his travels means it acted unfairly 
when it placed restrictions on his account. And given the sensitive nature I wouldnt 
reasonably expect a bank to disclose more detailed information to customers about its 
security measures and fraud prevention triggers. 
I dont underestimate the upset and inconvenience Mr C experienced here, and I can see he 
feels very strongly about this complaint. But I havent seen any evidence that suggests to me 
NatWest treated him unfairly or unreasonably. Im persuaded that it had legitimate concerns 
about his account.  And its actions were in line with the terms and conditions of his account, 
and those Id expect a bank to take where security issues are raised.
 
 
 My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 July 2020.
