The complaint
Mrs E complains that Oplo PL Limited wont let her cancel the loan agreement that she used 
to pay for a trial membership of a holiday club. She also complains about its response to her 
financial difficulties and the interest rate that shes paying.
What happened
Mrs E and her husband entered into an agreement for a trial membership of a holiday club in 
June 2019. The price of the trial membership was £4,395 and Mrs E entered into a fixed sum 
loan agreement with a finance provider for a loan of that amount. She agreed to make 35 
monthly payments of £144.50 to the finance provider. 
Mrs E contacted the finance provider in April 2020 to request a payment holiday as she and 
her husband had been affected by the government imposed restrictions in response to the 
pandemic. She was asked to complete an online application form but didnt do so. Mrs E had 
stopping making the loan repayments so the finance provider contacted her in June 2020 
about the arrears on her account and Mrs E then completed an application for a payment 
holiday. A six month payment holiday, backdated to April 2020, was then agreed but Mrs E 
complained that interest shouldnt be applied during the payment holiday and said that she 
wanted to cancel the trial membership and the loan agreement.
The holiday company extended the term of the trail membership by six months  and it has 
since been extended by a further twelve months - but the finance provider said that interest 
would still be applied during the payment holiday. It also said that it was satisfied that Mrs E 
was liable to make further contributions towards her loan and that it had awarded her the 
maximum amount of payment holiday but she should contact it to discuss the available 
options if she required any support with her payments. Mrs E wasnt satisfied with its 
responses so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She considered 
Mrs Es claims under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 but she didnt think that 
there had been any breach of contract or misrepresentation for which the finance provider 
would be responsible. She said that shed not seen any terms of the agreement that would 
enable Mrs E to cancel it if her circumstances changed and she was satisfied that Mrs E was 
told that she would continue to incur interest on her loan during the payment holiday.
Mrs E has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says that she 
wasn't offered a holiday in the UK and the holiday company has stopped communicating 
with her. She says that shes been told that the holiday company is in administration and 
shes paid for a holiday club membership that she wasn't able to use because of the 
government imposed restrictions in response to the pandemic and because of her and her 
daughters medical issues.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Es complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mrs E and her husband bought a trial membership of a holiday club in June 2019 and 
the agreement gave them the tight to reserve five holiday weeks within the following 
three years;
Mrs E and her husband also signed a separate standard form of the withdrawal 
notice that could be given if they wanted to withdraw from the agreement  and it 
said that they had the right to withdraw from the agreement within 14 days without 
giving any reason;
theres no other provision in the agreement that would allow Mrs E and her husband 
to end the agreement and receive a refund of the money that had been paid to the 
holiday company;
our investigator considered Mrs Es claims under section 75 which gives a consumer 
an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of 
credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
(provided that certain criteria set out in that section are met);
Mrs E had booked a holiday that was to be taken in August 2020 but it was cancelled 
due to the government imposed restrictions in response to the pandemic - I can 
understand that that would have caused distress and inconvenience for Mrs E but I 
dont consider that it would be a breach of contract by the holiday company;
the holiday company extended the term of the trial membership by six months  and 
it has since extended it for a further twelve months  and I consider that to be a fair 
and reasonable response by the holiday company to the issues caused by the 
pandemic  and the holiday company says that Mrs E is also able to take holidays in 
the UK;
I understand that the holiday club continues to operate and that the services under 
the trial membership agreement remain available to Mrs E and her husband and our 
investigator provided Mrs E with contact information for the holiday company;
Mrs E says that she wants to cancel the agreement because of her and her 
daughters medical issues but Im not persuaded that shes able to cancel the 
agreement because of those medical issues and the finance provider said that Mrs E 
should contact it to discuss the options that are available to her;
Im not persuaded that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
holiday company and I dont consider that Oplo is required to write-off the 
outstanding amount of Mrs Es loan agreement;
Mrs E says that shes experiencing financial difficulties and she contacted the finance 
provider in April 2020 to request a payment holiday as she and her husband had 
been affected by the government imposed restrictions in response to the pandemic 
and she stopped making her loan repayments;
Mrs E was asked to complete an online application form but didnt do so and she was 
then contacted by the finance provider in June 2020 about the arrears on her account 
- she then completed an application for a payment holiday and a six month payment 
holiday, backdated to April 2020, was agreed;
a credit provider is required to respond to a customers financial difficulties positively 
and sympathetically and I consider that the finance provider has responded to 
Mrs Es financial difficulties positively and sympathetically by agreeing a six month payment holiday and that it has dealt with the issues caused by the government 
imposed restrictions in response to the panic in an appropriate way and in a way that 
I consider to have been fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
I consider it to be more likely than not that Mrs E was told that interest would 
continue to accrue on the outstanding balance of her loan during the payment holiday 
and Im not persuaded that there was any requirement for the finance provider to 
have suspended interest during that period;
I sympathise with Mrs E for her and her daughters medical issues and the financial 
difficulties that shes experiencing but Im not persuaded that the finance provider has 
acted incorrectly in its dealings with her; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Oplo to cancel the loan agreement, to refund to Mrs E any of the payments that shes 
made under the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to her complaint.
I understand that Mrs E hasnt made any loan repayments since March 2000 and that her 
account is now significantly in arrears. I suggest that Mrs E contacts Oplo to discuss her 
options and to try to agree an affordable repayment arrangement for the amount that she 
owes to it. If she doesnt do so, I consider it to be more likely than not that Oplo will take 
further action to try to recover that money from her, to the extent that its legally entitled to do 
so.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Es complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 May 2023.
