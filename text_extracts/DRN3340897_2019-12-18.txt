K821x#15Complaint
Miss H says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny)  shouldnt  have provided 
her with instalment  loans  because she was in a debt spiral and these loans werent  
affordable for her. 
Background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  
22 November 2019. An extract from this is attached  and forms part of this final decision,  so 
I will not repeat that information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to partly uphold the complaint about  
loans 9  21. I invited  both parties to let me have any further comments and evidence.  
Sunny provided  some  additional comments;
Miss H repaid her loans on time and without any difficulty,
Her monthly repayments were only a small percentage  of her declared income,
Miss H exercised her statutory right to repay some of her loans  early  and
it shouldnt have  to remove loans from Miss Hs credit file. 
However, Sunny agreed something may have gone  wrong when it provided loans 14  21, 
and it agreed to refund the interest fees and charges on these loans as well as removing 
them from Miss Hs credit  file. 
Miss H (via the way of her representative), didnt accept the offer proposed by Sunny  on 
loans 14  21. Instead, she said that she would agree with the adjudicators findings in 
relation to loans  4  21. However, no further comments  were  provided as to why loans 4  8 
should be upheld.  
My findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Sunnys main argument as to why loans  9, and later loans shouldnt  be upheld  is that weve 
taken a disproportionate weight on the fact that Miss H had a number of other short-term 
loans outstanding at the time when  this loan was approved.  When, according to Sunny, 
there was no indication of any difficulty as all loans were repaid on time (or early) and the 
loans appeared affordable for Miss H. 
Sunny says it did carry out further  checks when loan 9 was approved  such  as taking into 
account of payday loans  that had been  reported to the credit reference  agencies. But, I am 
also mindful that the checks needed to go further  as I explained in my provisional decision 
and I think it was no longer reasonable for it to have relied  on the information Miss H had 
provided or the other  information that it may have found out. By now,  it needed  to take steps 
to verify that information, including any information it was provided from the credit searches. 
And as I explained, had it carried  out further,  more in-depth checks  it wouldve seen that 
Miss H wasnt  in a position  to sustainably repay  this loan, or any later loans. 
Ive thought about the comments Sunny has made  in relation to why it doesnt feel that loans 
14  21 should  be upheld because they were unsustainable. However, Sunny has already 
Ref: DRN33408972accepted that an offer should  be made  on these loans. So, it is for this reason, I dont 
intended to review these loans  further. 
Ive thought about Sunnys comments in relation  to the credit  file, but we have issued a 
number of decisions providing why we think that the records should be deleted from the 
credit file. This is because, in this instance,  the number of loans  taken in a relativity short 
period of time is itself adverse. 
Miss H hasnt provided any more comments about  my decision to uphold from loan 9, so I 
see no reason to depart from the findings  I reached in the provisional decision. That means, 
I wont be upholding the complaint about loans 1  8. And Sunny needs to take no further  
action about these loans. 
Having thought about all the comments that Ive been provided with, as well as what  I saw 
before issuing my provisional decision,  I still think Sunny was wrong to have given Miss H 
loans 9  21. And Ive outlined below what Sunny needs to do in order  to put things right. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss H paid on loans 9 to 21;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 9 - 13 from Miss Hs credit  file
remove loans 14  21 from Miss Hs credit file entirely, This is because  of the time 
Miss H spent in debt meaning any information about those loans is adverse. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, and in my provisional  decision, I partly uphold Miss Hs 
complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Miss H as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 January 2020.

background
Miss H took 21 instalment  loans from Sunny between January 2017 and May 2018.  A summary of 
Miss Hs borrowing, based on the information provided  to us by Sunny, can be found  in the appendix  
at the end of this decision.  
 
In our adjudicators  findings,  she thought Sunny  had treated Miss H fairly when it provided loans 1  
3, so she made no award against Sunny for these loans. 
However, the adjudicator didnt think any of the remaining loans  shouldve been provided. She 
thought loans  4 and 5 shouldnt have been lent because Miss H had a number of outstanding  short-
term credit commitments at the time. Any by loan 6 the adjudicator felt that by that by this point a 
pattern of lending had been  established which shouldve indicated to Sunny that Miss H wasnt able to 
sustainably make  her loan repayments.  
Sunny didnt  agree with the adjudicators  recommendation,  in response it made a number of points:
it carried out thorough  eligibility,  creditworthiness  and affordability checks  before each  loan 
was approved
the combined contractual repayments made up a small  portion of Miss Hs declared  income 
and;
Sunny took into account  that Miss H had a number  of loans running concurrently. 
As no agreement could  be reached, the case has been  passed to me for a final decision.  
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Miss H could repay  the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN33408974And the loan payments  being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an 
indication a consumer  could sustainably  make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically  follow 
this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to do so. And it follows  that a lender  should realise, 
or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make  their repayments 
sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Miss Hs complaint. And Ive decided to partly uphold Miss Hs complaint and 
have explained why below. 
But, unlike the adjudicator,  I dont think Sunny  was wrong  to have  provided Miss H with her first eight 
loans. And Ive explained  why, I think this is the case, given the individual circumstances of this case 
below. 
Sunny says it agreed to Miss Hs applications after she provided details of her monthly income 
(around £2,200 for each loan) and her expenditure, which varied but for the first few loans, was 
around £1,500 per month. And, based on what she declared, the information suggested that Miss H 
would be able to make the repayments she was committing to. So, in these circumstances, it wasnt 
irresponsible to provide these loans. 
The first four loans were all taken out within 14 days of each other, but even after the final loan in this 
chain was taken, the maximum monthly repayment Miss H was due to make (£118.79)  was still 
relativity small compared to her declared  income. So, based on the information Sunny had available, 
it wouldve likely seen that these loans  were affordable for Miss H. So I dont think  it was wrong to 
have given her these  loans. 
There was then a gap in lending of nearly  four months after loan four was repaid, before loan five was 
taken out. Considering what  Sunny knew about Miss H at the time, including her income  and 
expenditure, I think this gap was significant enough for Sunny to have treated  Miss Hs application 
afresh. So although  this was Miss Hs fifth loan, it was, in effect, her first in this new chain of lending. 
If therefore  follows, that for the same reason  Ive outlined  above I think Sunnys decision  to provide 
loans 5  8 were reasonable  because Sunny  was entitled to rely on the information  Miss H provided, 
and this information  suggests that Miss H was in a position to be able to afford the repayments  she 
was committed  to making. 
I accept that, for the first eight loans  Miss Hs financial circumstances may not have been fully 
reflected either in the information she provided, or the other information Sunny  obtained via the credit 
checks. And Miss Hs actual financial position might  well have been apparent if further information   
such as bank  statements - had been obtained.  
But, I dont think it had reached  the stage when  these  loans were approved that there was a greater 
risk of the repayments being unsustainable  for Miss H. I say this taking into account the information 
Sunny knew  about Miss H, the size of the repayments and how early on in the lending relationship 
these loans were taken.  In these circumstances, I dont  think Sunny needed  to take further steps to 
verify the information she had provided  such as asking  Miss H for evidence of her income and 
outgoings. 
So based on the information  that Sunny had available  at the time of each  lending decision,  I dont 
think it was wrong of it to have provided the first eight loans that Miss H was given.  
However, by loan 9, I no longer think it was reasonable for Sunny to have continued to rely on the 
information that Miss H was providing.  Miss H had returned for a new loan within  two weeks of 
repaying loan 5 and she wasnt significantly  reducing her borrowing. So I think,  given the number of 
loans that Miss H had taken,  Sunny needed to carry out further, more in-depth checks. 
Ref: DRN33408975And by now these checks needed to have  included verifying the information that Miss H was 
providing. It couldve  done  this a number  of ways, such as asking for evidence  of her income and 
outgoings.
In order  to consider what a proportionate check may have  shown Sunny, Ive used Miss Hs bank 
statement because  that is what I have to hand, and these statements  provide me with a fairly 
accurate indication  of what Miss Hs actual financial position was at the time of loan 9 being  approved.  
So, a proportionate check for loan nine, would most likely have shown that:
Miss H already  had a total of five outstanding payday loans with Sunny and other providers 
before loan 9 was approved. In these circumstances, there was a significant risk that Miss H 
wouldnt have been able to repay this loan or any later loans without undue  difficulty  or 
borrowing further.  
So I dont think this loan was sustainable  for miss H and Sunny shouldnt have provided this 
or any of the remaining  loans. 
 
Moving forward, I havent  recreated individual, affordability  checks for loans 14 to 21 because  I dont 
think that it is necessary to do so. I say this because Ive looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys  
lending history  with Miss H, with a view to deciding if there was a point at which Sunny should  
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so Sunny 
should have realised  that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Hs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 14. I 
say this because:
by this stage, Miss H was into her tenth month of owing  Sunny money. In my view, Miss Hs 
loan history  up until this point was in itself a clear  demonstration of her inability  to settle her 
loans over the life of the credit agreement.
Miss H continued  to be provided  with new loans during the time she had other loans 
outstanding, and when  new loans  were taken these  tended  to be taken up quickly after 
previous loans had been repaid.  For much of the time Miss H was indebted  to Sunny she had 
as many as four loans running concurrently. And the amounts Miss H was borrowing did 
fluctuate, but the monthly instalments  didnt decrease in any meaningful way over a sustained 
period of time. So Sunny  ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Miss H was having  
to borrow further to cover the hole the repayment of his previous loans left in her finances and 
that Miss Hs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably. 
Miss H wasnt reducing  the amounts she owed  to Sunny. For example, by loan 21 which was 
taken out around 16 months after Miss Hs first instalment loan was approved, the total 
outstanding due to Sunny at this time was not significantly smaller than previous loans. 
I think  that Miss H lost out when Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 14 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Miss Hs indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time; and
the number of loans and the length  of time over which Miss H borrowed  was likely to have 
had negative implications  on her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these  high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding the complaint about loans  9 to 21 and Sunny should  put things right as set out 
below.
