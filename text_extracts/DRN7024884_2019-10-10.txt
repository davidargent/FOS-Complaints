K821x#15Complaint
Mr A has complained about the payday loans CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid 
(CEN) lent to him. Mr A says they did not do proper checks before giving him the loans.
Background
CEN provided Mr A with 13 payday  loans between  October 2010  and October  2017. 
Mr As lending  history is as follows:

CEN originally accepted  that they could see a pattern of dependency  had emerged with 
loan 6 and made an offer to refund interest on this loan.
The adjudicator felt that alongside CENs offer on loan 6, CEN  shouldnt have given Mr A 
loan 5 and loans 10a -13.
CEN argued  that the repayments for loan 10a were relatively small in comparison to Mr As 
monthly disposable income. It considered  that loan 11 represented a new chain of lending 
with 104 days between  loans 10 and 11. 
CEN also believes that it is not possible  to assess the sustainability of each loan without 
looking at whether the specific repayments for each loan were made without undue difficulty.
Ref: DRN70248842CEN said its checks at the time of lending to Mr A did not reveal  that there was any reason 
to suggest he would  be unable to afford his repayments. Mr A had an exemplary repayment 
history for loans 5, 10a, and 11 with no late charges. And as he did not exhibit any signs  of 
financial difficulty, additional checks were not warranted. 
However, CEN agreed with the adjudicators  recommendation for loan 5, as their own further 
review has shown the repayments for loan 5 may have exceeded 80% of Mr As disposable 
income. 
As CEN did not agree  with the adjudicator on loans 10a-13, the case has been passed  to me 
for a decision. As neither party has provided  any further arguments regarding loans 1-10, it 
is left for me to consider  loans 10a13.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
outcome as the adjudicator.
The Office  of Fair Trading  (OFT) was the regulator when CEN lent to Mr A between 2010 
and 2014. The Financial Conduct Authority  (FCA)  was the regulator  when CEN lent to Mr A 
between 2016  and 2017. 
The FCAs Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC) is the specialist sourcebook  for credit-
related regulated activities. It sets out the rules and guidance specific  to consumer credit 
providers, such as CEN. Prior to that, the OFTs Irresponsible Lending Guidance (ILG) set 
out the relevant guidance.
It is important  to note that neither the OFT nor the FCA didnt,  and doesnt,  specify  exactly 
how an assessment of affordability  is to be carried out but the extent and scope and the 
types and sources of information to use needed  to be enough to be able to reasonably 
assess the sustainability  of the arrangement for the consumer.
In other  words the assessment  needs  to be consumer-focussed.  It is not an assessment of 
the risk to the lender  of not recovering the credit but of the risk to the consumer of incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant  adverse  consequence  as a result of the 
decision to lend.
As set out in the guidance, the risk to the consumer  directly relates to the particulars of the 
lending and the circumstances of the consumer. Therefore, a lenders assessment of 
creditworthiness would  likely need to be flexible. That is to say, what is sufficient for one 
consumer might not be for another, or indeed  what might  be sufficient for a consumer in one 
circumstance might not be so for the same  consumer in other circumstances.
Bearing the above in mind, I would expect an assessment  of creditworthiness  to vary with 
circumstance. In general, Id expect  a lender to require more  assurance, the greater the 
potential risk to the consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way. 
Certain factors might point to the fact that CEN  should fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending  was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include but are 
not limited to:
Ref: DRN70248843the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
CEN was required to establish  whether  Mr A could sustainably repay his loans   not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.  
The Consumer Credit  Sourcebook (CONC) and before that the Irresponsible  Lending  
Guidance (ILG) define sustainable as being  without  undue difficulties and, in particular, the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to meet the repayments.
It follows that if a lender  realises, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower  
wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able to make  
their repayments without borrowing further.
CEN told us its affordability  assessment integrates a variation of unique customer  specific 
variables as well as using  verified information  obtained from the applicant,  credit reference 
agencies and various other 3rd party reports.  CEN says it analysed Mr As current  financial 
commitments, insolvency records, delinquency records,  County  Court  judgments, credit  
queries and other credit account  currently open. 
Loan 10 was made  up of two small instalments followed by a much larger instalment. Mr A 
went on to top-up this loan on 3 January 2017, increasing the size of the final instalment to 
£611.80. This sum represented a significant  proportion of Mr As income. I understand CEN 
may have  expected Mr A to put money  aside  for this final repayment  but I dont think  it was 
reasonable of CEN to expect this in the circumstances.  I say this because Mr A topped-up 
this loan shortly before  the final repayment was due, which in itself suggested  he was not in 
a position to save.
There was a gap of three and a half months  before loan 11 but I dont think this was enough 
for CEN to be satisfied  that Mr As finances were back on track. So I have considered  loan 
11 as part of the same chain  of lending. Loan  11 was the largest loan to date and the 
highest instalment  represented over 50% of Mr As declared income.  
In light of this I think there was a significant risk that Mr A wouldnt have been able to meet  
the final repayment for both loan 10a and loan 11 without  having to borrow again. And so I 
think its unlikely Mr A wouldve been  able to meet his repayments for loan 10a and 11 in a 
sustainable manner.  
Ref: DRN70248844Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of CENs lending history with Mr A, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which CEN should reasonably have  seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so CEN should have realised that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr As case, I think  that this point  was reached by 12. I 
say this because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 9 and 11 of Mr A taking new loans 
shortly after repaying  previous ones. I think that by loan 12, CEN ought  fairly and 
reasonably to have  regarded  that pattern as established.
Mr A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed CEN. 
Loan 12 was taken out almost  8 months after loan 9. And it was for over 2 times the 
amount he initially  borrowed. 
Mr A had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to CEN over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr A lost out because CEN continued  to provide borrowing from loan 12 
onwards. These loans  had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of time. 
The sheer number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr As ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 12 - 13 as well as loans 10a and 11 and CEN 
should put things right as set out below.
Putting things right
CEN shouldnt have given loans 10a  13, it also accepted  it shouldnt  have given loans 5 
and 6.
A.Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr A towards interest,  fees and 
charges on these loans,  including  payments made  to a third party  where applicable, 
but not including anything  CEN  has already refunded. 
B.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr A which were 
considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Mr A originally  made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
Ref: DRN70248845C.Pay Mr A the total of A plus B.
D.Remove any adverse  information CEN  has recorded on Mr As credit file in relation to 
loans 5, 6, 10a and 11. The overall  pattern of Mr As borrowing for loans 12-13 
means any information recorded about them is adverse, so CEN should remove 
these loans entirely from Mr As credit  file. If CEN has sold any of the loans it should 
ask the debt purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CEN to deduct  tax from this interest. CEN should  give
Mr A a certificate  showing  how much tax it has deducted, if Mr A asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold  Mr As complaint as Ive explained above. I require 
CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as Quick Quid to put things right for Mr A as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 November  2019.
