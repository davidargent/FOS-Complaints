K822xcomplaint
The estate  of Mr C (Snr) complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) deprived 
Mr C (Snr) of investment funds, held by Mrs C, to his detriment.
background
Mrs C died on 12 October 2008.  Mr C (Snr), Mrs Cs husband, was appointed on 
11 April 2011 as the sole executor of Mrs Cs estate by the High Court.
At the time of her death Mrs C held two investments with Barclays, (investment 1 and 
investment 2) and one or more  bank accounts.
On 7 November  2008 Barclays says Mr C (Snr) notified the branch holding  Mrs Cs bank  
account(s) of her death and provided it with a copy of her death certificate.
On 18 November 2008 Barclays says it wrote to Mr C (Snr) with a valuation of investment 2 
(as at the date of Mrs Cs death)  and asked that he provide a sealed copy  of probate  and 
one of two forms. Ive seen a copy of this letter.
On 27 November 2008 Barclays says it wrote to Mr C (Snr) asking for the original death 
certificate, or a certified copy of the same, and to ask whether a will had been left and 
whether  probate would be obtained.
On 16 March 2011 Barclays says that Mr C (Snr) wrote to the then administrator of Mrs Cs 
two investments to confirm it of her death and to provide  it with a copy  of her death  
certificate.
Barclays says that the then administrator  of Mrs Cs investments  wrote  to Mr C (Snr)  in 
response to his 16 March  2011 letter  to say that it needed the original death certificate, or 
a certified copy of the same.
On 31 March 2011 Barclays says that it wrote to Mr C (Snr) to say that it hadnt heard from 
him in the last 12 months. Ive seen a copy of this letter.
On 29 April 2011 Mrs Cs investment funds were  transferred to Barclays, from the original 
administrator of them, as part of business  migration exercise.
On 11 July 2012 Barclays says it wrote  to Mr C (Snr) to say that it had still not received the 
original death  certificate,  or a certified copy of the same. Ive seen  a copy  of this letter.
On 15 August 2012 Barclays  says that it wrote  to Mr C (Snr) to say that it was still holding 
investments in the name of Mrs C and what it required for these to be dealt with.
On 8 October 2012 £2,625.97 was paid out to Mr C (Snr) in respect of Mrs Cs bank 
account(s). This was paid out by Barclays on it having had sight of the original death 
certificate, or a certified copy of the same, the only document it required to make  such  a 
payment.
On 11 October 2013 Barclays  says it wrote to Mr C (Snr), following what appears to have 
been telephone contact  from him on 7 October 2013. Ive seen a copy of this letter.
Ref: DRN10497642On 4 December  2013 Barclays says that it wrote to Mr C (Snr) to ask again that he provide it 
with a sealed copy of probate, or in lieu of the same, two alternative  forms completed by him. 
It also asked for the original death  certificate. Ive seen a copy of this letter.
Mr C (Snr) died on 18 April 2017. Mr C (Jnr) and Mrs P, Mr C (Snr)s children, were 
appointed on 21 November 2017  as the joint executors of Mr C (Snr)s estate by the High 
Court.
On 16 August 2018 Barclays  wrote to Mr C (Snr), unaware of his death, to say that it was 
still holding  investments in the name  of Mrs C and to confirm what it required from him to be 
able to deal with these. Ive seen  a copy of this letter.
In September  2018 £400.92 (investment  1) and £10,525.14 (investment 2) was paid out to 
the estate of Mr C (Snr).
In October  2018 the estate of Mr C (Snr) wrote  to Barclays to complain about  Mrs Cs 
investments not being released  to Mr C (Snr) following  the death of Mrs C and before his 
own death.
In November 2018 Barclays wrote to the estate of Mr C (Snr) to say that it didnt think it had 
done anything  wrong.
In December 2018 the estate of Mr C (Snr) wrote to Barclays to say that it was still unhappy 
about Mrs Cs investments not being released to Mr C (Snr) following the death of Mrs C and 
before his own death.
In January 2019 Barclays wrote to the estate of Mr C (Snr) to offer it £200  for the lack of 
correspondence from it (in respect of Mrs Cs investments) between January  2014 and 
July 2018.
In January 2019 £62.50  (investment 2) was paid out to the estate  of Mr C (Snr).
In February 2019  £2,627.49 (investment 2) was paid out to the estate of Mr C (Snr).
In February 2019  Barclays wrote  to the estate  of Mr C (Snr) to offer it £244.74, being the 
difference between  the value of investment 2 on the date of Mr C (Snr)s death  in April 2017 
of £13,459.87 and the sum paid out in respect  of it in September  2018, January 2019 and 
February 2019 of £13,215.13 (£10,525.14,  £62.50  and £2,627.49 respectively).
In March 2019, and unhappy  with Barclays response and offer of £444.74  (£200 and 
£244.77), the estate  of Mr C (Snr) referred a complaint to our service.
The estate  of Mr C (Snr)s complaint was considered  by one of our investigators  who 
concluded that Barclays offer of £444.74  was, in all the circumstances, fair and reasonable.
The estate  of Mr C (Snr) didnt agree with the investigators conclusion and so its complaint 
has been passed to me for review  and decision.
Ref: DRN10497643my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And having  done so, I can confirm that 
Ive come to the same  conclusion as the investigator and for broadly the same reasons. 
There is also very little I can usefully add to what  has already been  said.
I can understand the estate of Mr C (Snr)s frustration in realising that Barclays made no 
attempt to contact  Mr C (Snr) between  January  2014 and July 2018. I also accept  that 
Barclays could have  attempted  to contact Mr C (Snr) during this time but didnt. But equally,  
Im not persuaded Barclays was required to do so, or if it had, that Mr C (Snr) would have 
provided Barclays what it required  for Mrs Cs two investments to be dealt with.
I say this because  Barclays  had sent Mr C (Snr) a number of letters  between 
November 2008  and December 2013 (a period of five years)  asking him to provide various 
documents, none of which appear to have prompted  him to do so.
Furthermore, although I would expect a business (holding assets in the name of a deceased) 
to assist the appointed  executor of that deceaseds  estate, ultimately its for the executor to 
ensure the deceaseds estate is dealt with appropriately,  not for the business holding  the 
assets of the deceased.
Im also not persuaded that could  be said that Mr C (Snr) suffered material distress and 
inconvenience as a result  of the two investments remaining in Mrs Cs name between 
October 2008 and September  2018.  
Had being deprived of the proceeds  of these two investments caused Mr C (Snr) material 
distress and inconvenience, I might have  expected  him to have provided what Barclays  had 
asked him to provide (on more than one occasion  between November 2008 and 
December 2013), or to make contact  with it after December  2013. But Ive seen no 
persuasive evidence  that he did so.
I also think its worth pointing  out that Mrs Cs two investments dont appear to have suffered 
a loss whilst  being  held in her name between October 2008 and September 2018. For 
example investment 2, by far the largest  of the two investments, appears to have made  a 
return of over 5% simple per annum,  being  a return of £4,828.75 (£13,459.87 - £8,631.12) 
over ten years on an October 2008  valuation of £8,631.12.
So taking everything into account, Im satisfied that Barclays offer to pay £444.74 to be 
appropriate in all the circumstances. 
Ref: DRN10497644my final decision
My final decision is that Barclays Bank  UK PLC must pay the estate of Mr C (Snr); to the 
extent it hasnt done so already, £444.74 in full and final settlement of this complaint.
I appreciate that the estate of Mr C (Snr) will be disappointed  by my conclusions. My final 
decision, however,  represents the last stage of this services dispute resolution procedure.  
The estate  of Mr C (Snr) doesnt  have to accept my decision, and if it doesnt do so, it will be 
free to pursue legal action  against Barclays Bank  UK PLC.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C (Jnr) 
and Mrs P, as joint executors of the estate of Mr C (Snr),  to accept or reject my decision 
before 18 August 2019.
