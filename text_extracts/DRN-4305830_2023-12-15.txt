The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc closed his account and is unwilling to 
reopen it.
What happened
Mr M had an account with NatWest until 2014, when it was closed. In 2023, Mr M 
complained to NatWest about this  saying that he had been spoken to rudely when he 
spoke to it about this and that he remained unhappy with NatWests decision.
NatWest responded and explained that it had followed the correct process when closing the 
account. It said it acted in line with the terms and conditions of the account and that it 
couldnt now reinstate the account
Mr M remained unhappy with this and brought his complaint to our service where one of our 
investigators looked into it. They said that the terms of Mr Ms account with NatWest 
explained that it could close accounts and that it provided him 60 days notice of its intent to 
do so  although Mr M didnt receive that. But they felt that NatWest acted fairly here and 
that it had explained the reasons behind its decision, even if Mr M didnt think it had done so 
in enough detail. She saw that NatWest acknowledged and apologised for how it 
communicated with Mr M and felt this was enough to resolve this part of his complaint.
Mr M disagreed saying that NatWest gave him no expectation that it would ever close his 
account and continued to send him emails and cards, which led him to believe it was happy 
with the banking relationship. He also wanted to know the specific reasons NatWest closed 
his account. So the complaint was passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly Ive considered NatWests decision to close Mr Ms account. NatWest has told this 
service why it made this decision and its asked us to keep that confidential. Our rules allow 
us to receive evidence in confidence and so while we cant disclose some of this information 
to Mr M  Ive considered what its said. Having done so, Im satisfied it was entitled to close 
the account here. NatWest may not have given Mr M as much detail as he expected about 
its decision, but thats in line with what its terms say (and will have said) about this, which is 
that there are circumstances where it wont tell a customer why it has taken steps like this.
NatWests terms say (and will have said at the relevant time) that it can close an account by 
giving a customer 60 days notice of its intention to do so. While some of the records are 
limited by the time that has passed here  NatWest has mentioned sending a notice like this. 
Mr M says that he didnt receive that, but this doesnt change the fact that NatWest was 
entitled to close the account here and that it looks to have followed its process in doing so. In 
these circumstances, I wont be telling NatWest that it needs to reopen Mr Ms account.
Id add that Mr Ms account was closed back in 2014  so in effect hes now asking NatWest 
to reopen an account that was closed around nine years ago. I dont think itd be fair to 
expect a business to reopen an account after its been closed for such a long time. I realise 
the impact this will have on Mr M, given what hes said about his circumstances  but the 
account was correctly closed and has been that way for many years now. In these 
circumstances it wouldnt be fair for me to now tell NatWest to reopen this.
In saying the above, Ive considered everything that Mr M has said about when he sent 
messages to NatWest asking it to keep his account open in 2014. Ive also considered what 
hes said about the messages, emails and debit card he was receiving from NatWest that 
gave him the impression his account would remain open. But none of this changes my 
decision that NatWest was entitled to close his account when it did and that it wouldnt be 
fair to tell NatWest to reopen the account here after such a long time.
Mr M has also raised some service related issues about how he was spoken to at the time. I 
can see that NatWest has apologised if its service made him feel this way. In the 
circumstances, I think that apology is a fair way of dealing with that aspect of Mr Ms 
complaint. It follows that I wont be telling NatWest that it needs to do any more here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 January 2024.
