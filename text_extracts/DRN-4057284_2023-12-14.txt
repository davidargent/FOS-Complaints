The complaint
Mrs O complains that Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax (Halifax) is refusing to refund 
her the amount she lost as the result of a scam.
Mrs O was previously represented by a third party. To keep things simple, I will refer to Mrs 
O throughout my decision.
What happened
The background of this complaint is well known to all parties, so I wont repeat what 
happened in detail.
In summary, Mrs O was contacted by an individual over Telegram. This person asked Mrs O 
if she was interested in earning an additional income alongside her current job. As Mrs O 
was struggling financially, she expressed an interest and was later contacted by another 
individual (X) via WhatsApp.
X explained that the role was part-time and involved promoting tourism. No previous 
experience in this area was needed as the job was relatively simple.
Mrs O would have to invest in the business and complete missions to see a return. Mrs O 
was presented with a professional online platform and guided through how everything 
worked. She was also added to a WhatsApp group with over 70 other people also involved 
in the same process. After making a small investment Mrs O was able to make a withdrawal 
from her account with X which would have added to her confidence that the opportunity was 
legitimate.
Mrs O was later asked to top up her account by £10,000. The large payment request caused 
Mrs O concerns and after speaking to a family member she realised she had fallen victim to 
a scam.
Mrs O made the following payments into the scam via the cryptocurrency exchange Binance:

15 September 2022 Binance Debit Card £50.00
16 September 2022 Binance Credit - £84.25

Our Investigator considered Mrs Os complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. Mrs O 
disagreed so this complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It has not been disputed that Mrs O has fallen victim to a cruel scam. The evidence provided 
by both Mrs O and Halifax sets out what happened. What is in dispute is whether Halifax 
should refund the money Mrs O lost due to the scam.
Recovering the payments Mrs O made
Mrs O made payments into the scam via her debit card. When payments are made by card 
the only recovery option Halifax has is to request a chargeback.
The chargeback scheme is a voluntary scheme set up to resolve card payment disputes
between merchants and cardholders. The card scheme operator ultimately helps settle 
disputes that cant be resolved between the merchant and the cardholder.
Such arbitration is subject to the rules of the scheme, meaning there are only limited
grounds and limited forms of evidence that will be accepted for a chargeback to be
considered valid, and potentially succeed. Time limits also apply.
Mrs O was dealing with X, which was the business that instigated the scam. But Mrs O didnt 
make the debit card payments to X directly, she paid a separate cryptocurrency exchange 
(Binance). This is important because Halifax would only have been able to process 
chargeback claims against the merchant she paid (Binance), not another party (such as X).
The service provided by Binance would have been to convert or facilitate conversion of
Mrs Os payments into cryptocurrency. Therefore, Binance provided the service that was 
requested; that being the purchase of the cryptocurrency. The fact that the cryptocurrency 
was later transferred elsewhere  to the scammer  doesnt give rise to a valid chargeback 
claim against the merchant Mrs O paid.
As the service requested by Binance was provided to her, chargeback wasnt an option for 
Mrs O, Ive also thought about whether Halifax could reasonably have prevented some, or all 
her loss. 
Should Halifax have reasonably prevented the payments Mrs O made? 
It has been accepted that Mrs O authorised the payments that were made from her account 
with Halifax, albeit on Xs instruction. So, the starting point here is that Mrs O is responsible.
However, banks and other Payment Services Providers (PSPs) do have a duty to protect 
against the risk of financial loss due to fraud and/or to undertake due diligence on large 
transactions to guard against money laundering.The question here is whether Halifax should have been aware of the scam and questioned 
Mrs O about the payments she was making. And if it had questioned Mrs O, would it have 
been able to prevent the scam taking place.
Mrs O started making relatively small payments to a legitimate business (Binance). After 
making several small payments and receiving a small credit Mrs O made larger payments 
the largest of which was £2,500 on 29 September 2022. While other payments were also 
made on the same day the total amount was still less than £5,000.
By the time Mrs O started to make larger payments to Binance she had already made 
several payments to it and received a small credit without any complaints. 
It would be unreasonable to suggest that Halifax should intervene in every payment its 
customer makes  particularly payments that are to a legitimate business (as was the case 
here). When considering the payments in dispute, I dont think that when taken individually 
or collectively, Halifax would have had reasonable grounds to suspect a fraud or scam was 
taking place. I dont think the payments were unusual enough or of a high enough value to 
reasonably trigger Halifaxs fraud prevention systems prompting it to step in and question 
Mrs O.
So, I dont think Halifax missed an opportunity to prevent the scam, and it is not responsible 
for Mrs Os loss.   
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs O to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 January 2024.
