The complaint
Mr O is unhappy with the level of service provided by National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) in relation to a request for information and notice of instruction he provided to 
them.
What happened
Mr O had issues with his local council taking direct debit payments from his NatWest bank 
account. Mr O cancelled the direct debit with his local council, but he was concerned that 
they might attempt to reinstate this and take money via direct debit again. 
So, Mr O wrote a letter to NatWest and asked them whether they could take any steps to 
prevent the local council from reinstating the direct debit and informed them that he didnt 
want this to be allowed to happen.
Mr O didnt receive a response to his letter to NatWest, so he resent it, but he didnt receive 
a response to this letter either. After two more letters were sent by Mr O, NatWest did send a 
letter in response, in which they apologised to Mr O and said that they had previously replied 
via email. The letter went on to explain that it included a copy of the emails previously sent, 
but there wasnt any other document included with that letter. Mr O wasnt happy about this, 
so he made a complaint.
NatWest responded to Mr Os complaint. They apologised for any confusion caused and 
went on to explain that it wasnt the case that they could prevent the local council from 
setting up a new direct debit, but that if the local council did so, any money that was taken 
before the direct debit could be cancelled could be reclaimed via the direct debit guarantee.
Mr O wasnt satisfied with this response, so he referred his complaint to this service. One of 
our investigators looked at his complaint, but they didnt feel that NatWest had ignored Mr 
Os letters, and they were satisfied that the information that NatWest had given Mr O about 
the possibility of the local council reinstating the direct debit was correct. So, they didnt 
uphold the complaint either.
Mr O remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear that Mr O feels strongly that NatWest were ignoring the letters he sent to them and 
he doesnt accept that NatWest responded to these letters via email, because he has no 
record of any emails from NatWest in his email account. On the other hand, NatWest have 
provided evidence to this service which would suggest that these emails were sent.
In his response to the view put forward by our investigator, Mr O has expressed his dismay 
at what he sees as this service not believing his version of what has happened here. I can 
understand Mr Os frustration, but one of the features of this service is that it is impartial  
that is to say, it isnt the case that we believe one side of a story or the other.
Instead, in instances where the testimonies of two parties differ  as is the case here  what 
this service attempts to do is made a fair decision about what we feel is most likely to have 
happened, on balance, in consideration of all the evidence and information available to us. 
This doesnt mean that it will always be the case that we deicide that one version of events is 
more likely to have happened than another version, and it can be the case that we decide 
that it isnt fair to either party to consider one version of events more likely to have happened 
that the other. And I think thats the case here.
NatWest have advised that they sent responses to Mr Os initial letters via email, and Mr O 
has said that he didnt receive any emails, so they couldnt have been sent. I have no reason 
to doubt Mr Os testimony here, but equally, I have no reason to doubt the testimony of 
NatWest either.
Mr O has also said that because he wrote to NatWest via Royal Mail, any response that 
NatWest sent should also have been in letter form, and that it wasnt appropriate that 
NatWest should respond to him via email, as they claimed that they did. I can understand Mr 
Os dissatisfaction here, and I note that in his letter to NatWest that he asked them to put the 
information he was requesting in writing. 
However, asking for a response in writing is not the same as specifically asking NatWest to 
respond in letter form via the post, and I must note that if NatWest did respond via attaching 
a written letter to an email, then this response would be a response in writing. And NatWest 
are entitled to issue correspondence via a preferred channel  in this case, email  in the 
same way that Mr O is entitled to contact NatWest via Royal Mail if he wants to. So, Im not 
convinced that NatWest treated Mr O unfairly by choosing to initially respond to him via 
email, especially given that Mr O has an email address registered with NatWest. 
All of which means that its difficult for me to conclude that NatWest deliberately ignored Mr 
Os letters here, because there isnt clear evidence to enable me to make such a conclusion. 
Its also notable that the letter which NatWest said they sent to Mr O via email in response to 
his initial letter does provide a clear explanation of the information that Mr O was requesting, 
including why NatWest couldnt prevent the local council from setting up a new direct debit, 
but that if they did and money was taken, that Mr O would be able to recover this money.
And I can confirm that this was the correct information. So, it doesnt appear to me that 
NatWest were avoiding providing this information to Mr O, and equally I cant see that there 
would have been any reason for NatWest to do so. And while I dont doubt that Mr O didnt 
personally receive this information in as timely a manner as he would have liked, I cant 
conclude that this was because of any deliberate act on the part of NatWest. 
It follows then that Im unable to uphold this complaint. I understand that this wont be the 
outcome that Mr O was wanting, but there isnt sufficient evidence for me to conclude that 
NatWest ignored the letters that Mr O was sending to them, and Im satisfied that the 
information that NatWest provided to Mr O in response to his query  when he did receive it 
 was accurate. So I cant say that NatWest have treated Mr O unreasonably or unfairly 
here, and because of this, I wont be asking NatWest to take any further action at this time.
My final decisionMy final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 March 2021.
