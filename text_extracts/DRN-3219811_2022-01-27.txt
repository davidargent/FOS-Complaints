The complaint
Mrs T, through her representative, complains that S.D. Taylor Limited, trading as Loans at 
Home (LAH), lent to her irresponsibly. Her representative also says that Mrs T did not 
receive debt advice from LAH and failed to send to her its final response letter following her 
complaint.
What happened
We had very little information from either party but what I did have enabled me to create a 
brief loan table. W/O in LAHs records likely means written off but the date was not given. 
Correspondence from LAH suggests this write off was December 2016.

Mrs T sent to us a copy of her credit file dated 6 February 2020 but as that goes back for six 
years it does not cover the period of these loans. And it did not give me much information 
about her financial situation before February 2014. Mrs T sent nothing further.
Originally, LAH said that all these loans are outside of our jurisdiction and so it has not 
investigated them. It did issue a final response letter in February 2021 and it said all were 
Time Barred.
From LAH we have received the basic details about the loans approved, most of which are 
set out in the loan table above. LAH told us that letters relating to arrears were sent to Mrs T 
each year from 2009 onwards to 2016/17. Copies were not sent to us. It had no information 
about any credit search results, it had no account notes to send to me and so I had very little 
to review.
Of the ones LAH considered Time Barred, our adjudicator applied the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) rules which apply and thought that we could look at them all.
LAH originally disagreed with the adjudicators view on jurisdiction. This position has 
changed  see later in this decision. 
Our adjudicator looked at the merits of the complaint as well and thought that LAH should 
put things right for Mrs T for loans 4 to 21.
LAH wrote back to object about the jurisdiction element and a second view was issued by 
our adjudicator to confirm the first view, as well as informing LAH that the case would be 
passed to an ombudsman for both jurisdiction and merits to be considered.
I issued a provisional decision on 20 January 2022 in which I gave reasons why I felt able to 
consider all the loans and that each fell within our jurisdiction. I do not repeat those points 
here as LAH has not disagreed and has responded to that part of my provisional decision 
relating to Mrs Ts complaint on its merits. So, LAH has decided to proceed to try to resolve 
the complaint rather than raise issues on jurisdiction. 
That part of my provisional decision relating to the merits of Mrs Ts complaint is duplicated 
here in full and in smaller type size to differentiate it from my final determination which is set 
out later in this decision. 
What I provisionally decided on the merits of the complaint  20 January 2022
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-
term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance, and good industry practice - on our website. 
LAH has received many decisions from this Service about irresponsible lending and so my summary 
here is brief.
I note that some loans were approved by LAH for Mrs T when the relevant guidance for lenders was 
before the FCA was the regulator. And this case concerns loans that were started before the Office of 
Fair Tradings Irresponsible Lending Guide (ILG) was issued in March 2010. Prior to this the FLAs 
Lending Code 2006 gave some appropriate guidance to use when lending. And from January 2008 
onwards theres also the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) Consumer credit licensing guidance.
The FLA Lending Code refers to a potential lender having to carry out a sound and proper credit 
assessment rather than a proportionate check. And rather than specifying the lending being 
sustainable the earlier guidance refers to the lender having to consider factors which may show a 
high risk of experiencing financial difficulty. And, under the guidance given by the OFT, businesses 
should make sure they have made reasonable enquires to ensure it lent responsibly.
Whilst the wording is different in the OFTs ILG (March 2010), the Lending Code 2006 and the OFT 
guidance, the tests to ensure the lending is right for the consumer are broadly similar. I have 
considered them all.
Im familiar with the Office of Fair Tradings Irresponsible Lending Guide (ILG) issued in March 2010. 
Under the guidance given by the OFT, businesses should make sure they have made reasonable 
enquires to ensure they have lent responsibly. The OFT ILG was the foundation of the rules going forward in the FCA C book (CONC) and often sections of the ILG were cited in those rules.
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that LAH should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. But certain factors might 
point to the fact that LAH should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Mrs T. These factors include:
othe lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
othe higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
othe greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become or was becoming 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. and/or may lead the lender to recognise that the 
customer was showing a high risk of experiencing financial difficulty.
LAH was required to establish whether Mrs T could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the 
loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is because 
the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and in particular the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; 
as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should 
realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to do so without borrowing further. Similarly, with 
the earlier guidance and codes.
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mrs Ts complaint.
The secondary complaint points
The complaint points raised by Mrs T relating to not receiving debt advice from LAH and not receiving 
a final response letter (FRL) are addressed here.
On current evidence I have no information about whether or not LAH provided such advice to Mrs T 
nor whether Mrs T ever asked for it. LAH has time to respond to this element if it has anything further 
to say on this. But I do not plan to uphold this element. LAH did issue its FRL and so I consider that 
part of the complaint resolved.
Irresponsible lending
I do not have enough for me to review Mrs Ts financial circumstances in detail and considering the 
age of the loans, and what has been forwarded to me already, its not likely that I will obtain much 
more detail. This is a provisional decision with a short turn around to allow Mrs T (and LAH if it 
wishes) to send me more details and information which I can review next week.
However, using what I do have, has meant that I have come to some provisional conclusions. LAH 
has informed us that Mrs T was receiving arrears notices regularly from around 2009 and so I do think 
that it demonstrates that she was not good at repaying and was at risk of falling into financial difficulty 
and that LAH knew this.
I have looked at the loan table and noticed that it had become a regular pattern that Mrs T would use 
additional fresh loans to repay earlier ones. Sometimes Mrs T had 5 or 6 loans on the go at the same time. The length of time it took to repay her loans became longer and longer.
So, I think that from Loan 10 when Mrs T was asking for two loans on the same day and looks to have 
been refinancing previous loans yet again, then that is when I think LAH ought to have recognised 
that the pattern of lending had become unsustainable, and/or that Mrs T was at serious risk of falling 
into financial difficulty. I am planning to conclude that LAH ought to have ceased lending completely at 
loan 10.
I think that Mrs T lost out because LAH continued to provide borrowing from loan 10 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ts indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mrs Ts ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, I am planning to uphold Mrs Ts complaint from Loans 10 onwards and I am planning to direct 
LAH puts things right as set out below.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
How both parties responded
LAH accepted the provisional decision and calculated the figures for the uphold for loans 10 
to 21. These calculations were sent to Mrs T and her representative replied to accept. 
In the circumstances the complaint is resolved in line with my provisional decision reasoning 
and findings and I uphold the complaint for loans 10 to 21. 
In relation to the secondary complaint points, neither party sent to me anything further. So on 
whether LAH had failed to issue an FRL, I do not uphold that part, and on the issue 
surrounding whether Mrs T received debt advice, I have no information about it and so I do 
not uphold that part of Mrs Ts complaint. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress LAH should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Mrs T from loan 10, as Im satisfied it ought to 
have. Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs T may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between her and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct.
From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Mrs T in a 
compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Mrs T would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. 
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce LAHs liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right.
LAH shouldnt have given Mrs T loans 10 to 21. LAH has agreed with this provisional 
decision and it must ensure that the calculated figures and credit file amendments are in line 
with my directions here: 
LAH should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs T towards interest, 
fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything LAH have already refunded.
LAH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs T 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs T originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
Some loans were written off around December 2016. LAH may  if LAH chooses to  
use the total of A plus B to repay any principal which LAH have written-off, if it did 
that.
LAH should pay any remaining refund to Mrs T. If there is no refund left and still a 
balance outstanding made up of written-off principal, it would not be fair for LAH to 
pursue this further.
The overall pattern of Mrs Ts borrowing for loans 10 to 21 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so for those loans which still appear on her credit 
file, I direct that LAH should remove these loans entirely from Mrs Ts credit file. If 
LAH have sold any of the loans LAH should ask the debt purchaser to do the same.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to deduct tax from this interest. LAH should give 
Mrs T a certificate showing how much tax LAH has deducted if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Ts complaint in part and I direct that S.D. Taylor 
Limited does as I have outlined above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2022.
