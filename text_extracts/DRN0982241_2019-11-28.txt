K821x#15complaint
Ms E complains  that PDL Finance Limited  (trading as Mr Lender) made short-term lending to 
her when it shouldnt  have.
background
Between 2014 and 2016 made five loans to Ms E. She repaid them by the end of 2016. But 
in 2018 Ms E complained  that PDL shouldnt  have made the loans to her.
In a final response letter, PDL rejected the complaint. Ms E brought her complaint to us.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in part. She didnt think it 
unfair that PDL made loan 1.
But the adjudicator thought that there  were signs that Ms E was struggling to repay loan 1. 
Ms E had rolled over the repayment for loan 1 three times. And the amount for loan 2 had 
increased. So the adjudicator thought  PDL shouldnt have made loans 2, 3, 4 and 5. The 
adjudicator recommended  that PDL should:
A) add together  the total of the repayments made  by Ms E towards interest, fees and 
charges on these loans,  including payments made to a third party  where applicable, but not 
including anything already refunded;
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Ms E which  were  
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms E originally made  the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled;
C) pay Ms E the total of A plus B.
D) remove  any adverse information it has recorded on Ms Es credit  file in relation to loans 2, 
3, 4 and 5. If it has sold any of the loans it should ask the debt purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires PDL to deduct tax from this interest. PDL should give
Ms E a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
PDL disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It asked for an ombudsman to review  the 
complaint. It says, in summary, that:
A customer was allowed to roll over a loan 3 times at the time of her roll overs.  This 
does not mean that Ms E was showing any signs of struggling financially and she 
settled the loan in full without any problem. At no time has she informed PDL of 
financial difficulty, nor is there  any evidence  that shows she was struggling 
financially.
The loan amount on loan 2 increased  by just £50, from £300 to £350. However, the 
highest repayment had decreased from £405  to £176.40. In addition to this, there 
was a gap of 7 months before loan 2.
For loan 2, Ms E had a credit limit for £750, however she opted to only borrow  £350.
Ref: DRN09822412She did actually meet  all of her instalment repayments on time for loan 2 and every 
loan thereafter.  
During Loan 3, on 5 November 2015,  Ms E paid off some of her loan. She confirmed 
that she was not struggling financially.
There were  sufficient  gaps between loans 3, 4 and 5. After loan 3, loans  4 and 5 
decreased by 45% and 50%.
Ms E said loan 4 was for new curtains  and furniture.
Ms E said loan 5 was for home improvements.
my findings
Before each loan,  PDL needed to make sure that it wasnt lending irresponsibly.  It needed to 
carry out proportionate checks that Ms E could afford repayment in a sustainable way.
From its records, PDLs  loans to Ms E were  as follows:
No. Date Amount  Date Repaid   
1 11/01/2014 £300.00 30/05/2014  
2 24/12/2014 £350.00 29/05/2015  
3 05/07/2015 £800.00 31/12/2015  
4 31/12/2015 £450.00 18/05/2016  
5 14/07/2016 £400.00 30/11/2016 
Before each loan,  PDL recorded  Ms Es monthly income as £1,627.00 and her monthly 
expenditure as £915.00. From what Ive seen,  I find it likely that Ms E gave these figures.
As it was PDLs first loan to Ms E and it was for £300.00, I wouldnt expect a high level of 
checks before loan 1. Im satisfied that PDL did enough checks including  asking Ms E for 
information about her normal  monthly income, normal  monthly living costs and regular 
financial commitments.
Loan 1 was a payday loan. It fell due at the end of January 2014. But Ms E didnt repay it 
then. Instead she deferred payment in January, February March  and April 2014. Each  time 
she incurred high interest charges.
Keeping in mind  the high interest  charges, I find it likely that Ms E wouldve paid off loan 1 if 
she could. So I find that the deferrals show that she had been  struggling to make  repayment. 
She finally repaid  loan 1 at the end of May 2014.
After she repaid loan 1, between six and seven months went  by before Ms E asked for loan 
2. Thats  quite a significant gap. But  notwithstanding  that gap  I think  PDL shouldve  kept 
in mind the extent  to which  Ms E had struggled  to repay loan 1.
Compared to loan 1, loan 2 was for the slightly  higher amount of £350.00. Instead of being 
repayable by a single instalment, loan 2 was repayable by five instalments, the first of which 
Ref: DRN09822413was of about £176.40. So  having struggled to repay loan 1 in the first half of 2014   Ms E 
was taking on a commitment for the first half of 2015.
I consider that there was a significant  risk that Ms E wouldnt be able to meet  that 
commitment in a sustainable way  that is without  further short-term borrowing.
And indeed  after she repaid loan 2 in late May 2015, no more  than about a month went  by 
before Ms E felt the need to apply  for loan 3  which was more  than twice as large and for a 
further period  of six months.
From PDLs  statement of account I dont  find that Ms E made any payment on 5 November 
2015. So I dont  accept that she made any such payment  or that it is evidence that she 
wasnt struggling financially.
I acknowledge that loans 4 and 5 were smaller. But I dont think PDL shouldve made any 
loans to Ms E after loan 1.
As Ms E repaid all of the loans, I dont think theres  any question of any balance  being 
outstanding to PDL or to any debt purchaser.
But I find it fair and reasonable to direct PDL to refund Ms E the interest and charges she 
paid on loans 2 to 5. And I will direct  PDL to add interest  at our usual rate.
As I dont think PDL shouldve made loans 2 to 5, I will direct it to remove from Ms Es credit 
file all adverse information  relating to them.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct PDL Finance Limited (trading as Mr Lender)  to (in relation to its loans to Ms E on and 
after 24 December 2014):
1.refund  each amount of interest and charges that Ms E paid; and
2.pay simple  interest at a yearly  rate of 8% on each such amount from the date Ms E 
paid it to the date PDL refunds  it. If PDL considers that its required by HM Revenue 
& Customs to withhold  income  tax from that interest, it must  tell Ms E how much  its 
taken off. It should also give her a tax deduction  certificate if she asks for one, so she 
can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs  if appropriate;  and
3.remove all adverse  information from Ms Es credit file.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 December  2019.
