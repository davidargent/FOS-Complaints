K820x#14Complaint
 
Mr W has complained that National Westminster Bank plc (NatWest) has been unable  to 
find a record of an account he held with them.
Mr W also complained that he didnt receive a reply when he was asked to provide his sort 
code and account number by NatWest  during  their investigation.
Background
Mr W found an old savings book and when he contacted NatWest  they werent able to locate 
the account. 
NatWest carried out a search  of their systems and identified an account  that Mr W had - 
account ending  2494. This was transferred to a new account number ending 1632  in 1999. 
That account was closed in April 2017. NatWest  also identified another  savings account        
 ending 3877 which closed in 1998. NatWest were unable to find a record of the account 
that Mr W has complained about.  
As part of their investigation, NatWest asked Mr W for further details to help identify the 
account. Mr W says he didnt  receive a reply  when he provided this information.  
One of our adjudicators didnt uphold this complaint.  She said that NatWest had looked to 
locate the account but werent  able to find a record of it. She said that they had sent Mr W a 
response letter after hed given them the information  theyd asked  for. 
Mr W disagreed,  as he felt his own records went back  further  than NatWests  so this should  
prove what he says. The complaint  has now been passed to me for a final decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered all of the evidence, I dont uphold this complaint. Ill explain why 
below.
NatWest looked  at the history they held for Mr W and carried  out a search  of their dormant 
accounts - but nothing  was found that related to the passbook Mr W has. This suggests  to 
me that its more likely than not that the account was closed and any balance  withdrawn or 
was transferred elsewhere.  
I say this because,  NatWest have said that if Mr Ws account hadnt  been used for five 
years, the account holding branch will have  first attempted to contact Mr W and if this was 
unsuccessful the account would then be transferred  to their head  office  where a permanent 
record would  be maintained - but no such record exists for this account. 
Ive also noted  that these  events happened a long time ago  so if this account  didnt 
become a dormant  account, the records that would show what  happened to the money in it 
no longer exist. NatWest  have said that they keep statements for up to eight years and 
closed account  information for up to three years. Given the passage of time it is not 
Ref: DRN97130232unreasonable for NatWest not to be able to evidence this further  through  documentary proof 
 banks are not required  to keep account documents  indefinitely.
So its a possibility that the account  was closed without the passbook  if, for example, it was 
lost or wasnt needed for the transaction.  
Ive considered what Mr W has said about his records going back  further  than NatWests.  
Whist this appears to be correct, theres  very limited information available for me to be able 
to fairly conclude that Mr Ws complaint should  be upheld. As Ive already said,  NatWest  
arent required to keep records indefinitely. 
Although I appreciate that this wont be the outcome that Mr W wanted, Im satisfied that 
NatWest have carried out a search  of their records and the account  that Mr W has 
complained about cant  be located based  on the available information.  
Ive also carefully considered Mr Ws comments about not receiving a reply  from NatWest 
when they asked for further details to try and find the account. Im satisfied that Mr W was 
sent a final response  letter in February  2017  following the further information he provided  
about the account details.  NatWest have said they sent Mr W a gift to apologise if he hadnt 
received the final response letter. I dont require NatWest to do anything  further.  
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 September 2019.
