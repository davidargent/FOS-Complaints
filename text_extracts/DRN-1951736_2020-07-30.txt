The complaint
Mr W complained about the service he received from National Westminster Bank Plc, when 
he reported fraudulent direct debits on his account.
NatWest agreed the direct debits were fraudulent and refunded Mr W, but Mr W believes 
NatWest should pay him more compensation than it paid him. 
What happened
In 2017, three unauthorised direct debits were debited from Mr Ws account. These were:
20 March 2017 £7,774.54
19 June 2017 £418.56
27 September 2017 £99.00
The first two went to the same originator and the third to a different one. NatWest didnt send 
Mr W notification that the direct debits had been set up. 
The early history of Mr Ws complaint isnt clear. At some point in early 2019, Mr W noticed 
these payments and contacted NatWest. He said he hadnt authorised them and asked for a 
refund. Mr W told us that NatWest sent him a letter on 25 March 2019 saying his complaint 
had been closed, when it hadnt been dealt with. And he said hed emailed the bank on 29 
March. NatWest doesnt have copies of either of these. 
The history of the problems is more documented from April 2019. Between 2 and 12 April, 
Mr W made two visits to his local branch, and made four phone calls to NatWest. He said 
that the branch told him hed be lucky to get his money back at all. Mr W, who was a long-
term customer, also said that there was a lack of empathy, engagement and understanding. 
He closed his account because he felt let down, and complained to NatWest on 3 May.
NatWest refunded £8193.10, for the first two direct debits, on 9 April, and the remaining £99 
on 8 May. It replied to Mr Ws complaint on 20 May. NatWest apologised that Mr W had had 
to chase the bank for the direct debit refunds. It carried out an arithmetical calculation for Mr 
Ws losses, and paid him £150 for 15 hours which hed spent trying to resolve the issue. It 
also calculated the mileage to Mr Ws branch and paid him £6.75 for travel costs.
Mr W wasnt satisfied with NatWests response and contacted this service. He said that he 
thought £750 compensation would be fair.
The investigator noted that NatWest hadnt notified Mr W about the direct debits being set 
up. Mr W had also had to phone NatWest four times for information about his refund. The 
investigator listened to the calls, and said he could understand that not receiving answers, 
being asked to call back, and being asked to wait, would have caused uncertainty and 
distress. NatWest told the investigator that it was unlikely the branch would be able to recall 
the events when Mr W went in in early 2019. But the investigator considered the bank didnt 
fully understand Mr Ws situation or that it would cause him worry and stress. So he 
considered that NatWest should pay Mr W a further £200 compensation.
NatWest agreed to pay an extra £200. But Mr W didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman 
decision.
What Ive decided and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I consider that NatWest provided Mr W with poor customer service:
- NatWest didnt send Mr W information about the direct debits when they were set up 
in 2017; 
- Although I dont have information about the early stages when Mr W reported the 
problem in March 2019, NatWest didnt process the refunds for some time;
- As NatWest cant provide its letter of March 2019, I accept Mr Ws version that the 
letter said the bank had closed his complaint even though it hadnt been dealt with by 
that stage; 
- I also accept Mr Ws evidence that branch staff werent helpful. I appreciate that 
NatWest said that the events of early 2019 are a long time ago, and the branch is 
busy, so it hasnt provided evidence from the branch. But if the branch had been 
helpful, Mr W wouldnt have needed to phone NatWest centrally;
- Ive listened to the four call recordings from April 2019. The call handlers were polite, 
but the earlier calls in particular werent very customer focused. Mr W was twice told 
to call back, or wait for longer, and was put on a long hold.
I have, however, borne in mind that Mr W didnt report these substantial 2017 debits from his 
account until early 2019.  I can understand that this would have made NatWest more 
cautious about checking the validity of Mr Ws claim.
Having found that NatWest provided Mr W with poor customer service, Ive gone on to 
consider how much compensation would be reasonable. 
Our power to award compensation comes from the rules which govern our service. These 
say that we can award compensation which is a proportionate reflection of the impact a 
banks actions, or inactions, had on the customer.
Compensation isnt intended to fine or punish a bank, which is the role of the regulator, the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). But if we consider a bank has acted unfairly, we consider 
the impact on the customer. Were all inconvenienced at times in our daily lives, and in our 
dealings with other people, businesses and organisations. For us to award compensation, 
we need to decide that the impact of a banks actions has been greater than just a minor 
inconvenience or upset. Here, I do consider that NatWests customer service had an impact 
on Mr W which wasnt a minor inconvenience or upset. 
This service doesnt calculate compensation in the arithmetical way which NatWest adopted, 
with an hourly rate. And Mr W hasnt disputed the £6.75 which NatWest refunded for travel 
costs, so I havent addressed that. But taking all the circumstances into account, I consider 
that a fair and reasonable amount of compensation for NatWests customer service failings 
is £350. NatWest has paid Mr W £150, leaving £200 to pay.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I order National Westminster Bank Plc to 
pay Mr W a total of £350 compensation. It has already paid him £150, leaving £200 more to 
pay.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 27  August 2020.
