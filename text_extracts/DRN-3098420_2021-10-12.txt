The complaint
X complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wrongly withdrew money from her account 
and unfairly closed her account. 
What happened
X had an account with NatWest. In June 2019 NatWest received a letter from the Child 
Support Agency (CSA). The letter explained that the CSA had made a lump sum interim 
deduction order and intended to recover arrears of child maintenance from Xs account of 
just over Â£3,000. X was also given notice of the order.
The CSA wrote to NatWest again in August 2019, this time with a final order. The agencys 
letter said that NatWest would have to make payment from Xs account and provided 
instructions how to do so. NatWest confirmed it had secured the sum set out in the order. 
NatWest then removed the amount specified in the order from Xs account and paid it to the 
account nominated in the order.
In December 2019, NatWest decided to close Xs account and gave her 60 days notice to 
make alternative banking arrangements.
X complained to NatWest. She said she didnt owe any child support payments, that her 
children were now adults and working. And her husband was wealthy so didnt need the 
money. So, the bank shouldnt have removed any money from her account. She also said 
shed been a good customer for a number of years and needed her account. 
NatWest said it was obliged under the CSA order to do what it did. And had closed Xs 
account in line with the account terms and conditions. Unhappy with this response, X 
brought her complaint to our service.
An investigator looked into Xs complaint. He said NatWest hadnt done anything wrong and 
didnt uphold the complaint. X disagreed. She wants NatWest to give her back the money it 
took from her account. And reopen her accounts.
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal and 
regulatory obligations. NatWest was obliged to make the payments under the order it 
received from the CSA.  I appreciate that X is upset and feels wronged by whats happened. 
But if X believes that the payment shouldnt have been made then she will need to take that 
up with the CSA. Having looked at all the evidence, and reviewed the CSA order, I dont find 
that NatWest was at fault in making the payment. 
I then turn to the banks decision to close Xs account. NatWest made the commercial 
decision to close Xs account. This service wont usually interfere with a banks commercial 
discretion. As the investigator explained, its generally for banks to decide whether or not 
they want to provide, or to continue to provide, banking facilities to any particular customer. 
Unless theres a very good reason to do so, this service wont usually say that a bank must 
keep customer or require it to compensate a customer who has had their account closed.
Banks should however, give reasonable notice before closing an account. Usually, that 
means 60 days notice, but it can be less  depending on the circumstances. In this case 
Barclayss gave X 60 days notice. Ive reviewed the terms and conditions and 
circumstances of this complaint, and Im satisfied NatWest acted in line with them, so, it was 
entitled to close the accounts as it has already done. I know X wants to know the reason why 
NatWest decided to close her account, but the bank isnt obliged to share this with 
X.
I realise that X feels shes been treated unfairly by the CSA and that NatWest has added to 
her sense of injustice. But I dont believe the bank has treated her unfairly. So, I wont be 
asking NatWest to reopen Xs account or refund the money it took from her account.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask X to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2021.
