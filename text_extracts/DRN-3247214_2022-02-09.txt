The complaint
Mrs C says Mutual Clothing and Supply Company Limited (Mutual) lent to her irresponsibly. 
She says the lending wasnt affordable and so Mutual shouldnt have lent to her. 
What happened
This complaint is about 21 home collected loans Mutual provided to Mrs C between 
April 2011 and October 2020. Some of the information I have been provided about the 
lending is in the table below.

I understand loan 7 was withdrawn and Mrs C paid no interest on it. And Mrs C has said that 
she actually borrowed from 2006 onwards. But, both parties to the complaint dont have any 
information about this period of lending (assuming it took place), so I am unable to consider 
it. 
Mutual didnt think that that this service should consider all of the loans as it thought Mrs C 
had complained about them too late. But this issue has now been resolved as Mutual has, 
after some correspondence, consented to us looking at the earlier loans. So, I can look at all 
of the lending. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She said that Mutual shouldnt have approved 
any lending from loan 6 onwards as the lending pattern itself was now harmful. Mutual 
disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. Ive read in total what Mutual has said, and a 
summary of this is below:
This service has applied completely arbitrary criteria without providing any reasons. 
No reasons or explanation have been given by the ombudsman service to support 
the assertions made. 
The mid-cost of Mutuals product, the length of the product and the product features 
have been assessed with a short-term lending approach which is not appropriate to 
its lending.
The pattern of lending shows no signs of unsustainable borrowing. 
Mutual robustly assess affordability and creditworthiness in a manual review 
including considering the sustainability of the lending. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said repeat lending in home credit is 
common and does not cause harm. 
There is no evidence the customer was reliant on the loans. 
No evidence has been provided by the customer to show the loans caused them 
financial problems. 
It obtained seven separate credit reference agency reports for this customer between 
2018 and 2021 and each report showed no signs of financial difficulties. 
There is no requirement for the customer to have a break in lending contained in 
any rule or guidance Mutual is aware of. 
For the agreements provided after June 2020, it assessed the applications under its 
enhanced creditworthiness process which has been scrutinised in great detail by the 
FCA. These assessments involve verification of expenditure against ONS data and 
strict affordability criteria. 
The customer cannot be reliant on the credit in a harmful way if they do not borrow 
for over one year. There was no loan taken in 2015 and again no loan taken in 2017. 
Mrs C didnt disagree with the adjudicators opinion. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me, an ombudsman, 
to issue a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mutual needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs C could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mutual should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Mrs Cs complaint in part and Ive explained why below.
Mutuals response concerns how it defines the cost of the credit and the risk of it to Mrs C. It 
also concerns our approach to repeat lending. This Service has responded to Mutual on 
these issues in detail through other final decisions it has received, and the published 
decisions on our website. So, Im not going deal with these points at length here.
I will say briefly that I consider it reasonable to describe this lending as high cost credit, as 
does the FCA, which includes home collected credit within its identified high cost credit 
cohort. And while I note it has a longer term than, for example, a payday loan, that does not 
make it a low risk, or inexpensive, option for a consumer. And, as such, long-term use of 
these products can be harmful to a consumer. The FCA has not said anything to the contrary 
on this point. I have considered these issues alongside everything else in making my 
decision.
Mrs C didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 5. Because of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. And, for the avoidance of 
doubt, given the evidence I have, I dont disagree with what the adjudicator said about this 
lending. But it was part of the borrowing relationship Mrs C had with Mutual. So, it is 
something I will take into account when considering the other loans, she took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 6 to 21 because I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so.
But I will comment that much of the information provided by Mutual about the checks it 
made concerns the process its agents would have followed. But there is very little 
evidence to show these processes were followed here. There is application data for some 
of the lending, but there isnt a great deal of detail in it. And whilst there is credit reference 
information for some of the later lending I dont think Mutual looked at this for the earlier 
loans. 
Overall, Im not clear how outlining the policies its agent is supposed to have followed, but 
might not have done, are helpful here. Im not able to place any weight on descriptions of what ought to have happened.
Notwithstanding my concerns about the sales process itself, Ive looked at the overall 
pattern of Mutuals lending history with Mrs C, with a view to seeing if there was a point at 
which Mutual should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Mutual should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any 
further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Cs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
Mrs C had been indebted to Mutual for around 14 months. The loans were (mostly) 
intended to run for around a year, so Mutual could have expected a longer-term 
relationship. But because these loans often overlapped, her overall indebtedness and 
weekly repayments had increased over this this period. 
So, rather than a picture of decreasing indebtedness which would happen when a 
loan is taken and repaid, there was a pattern of repeated and increasing borrowing. I 
think taking out six high cost loans, over this period, is a strong indicator that Mrs C 
was starting to struggle financially.
Right from the start Mrs C was provided with a new loan within a short time of settling 
an earlier one, or when she hadnt repaid her existing loan. So, there wasnt an 
appreciable time when Mrs C wasnt in debt to Mutual. And its notable that by loan 6 
Mrs C hadnt repaid loans 3, 4 and 5. The total she had borrowed over these loans, 
in a ten month period was £1,850 which is a very high amount, given what I know 
about her circumstances. She would go on to borrow a further £1,500 a few months 
later. 
At this point Mutual ought to have known that Mrs C was not likely borrowing to meet 
a shorter-term shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need. And, Mutual 
ought to have realised it was more likely than not that Mrs Cs indebtedness was now 
unsustainable. 
And this is reflected in the information Mutual recorded about why Mrs C started 
these loans. The majority of these loans were used to fund yearly expenditures such 
as holidays and Christmas. And it isnt necessarily or automatically unreasonable to 
use this type of credit to do this. But using a high cost form of borrowing over a 
prolonged period is still likely to have caused financial problems, and in this case the 
evidence suggests it left Mrs C with little alternative but to borrow again in the future, 
when these yearly expenditures were likely to be incurred again, as she did.
Mrs C didnt make any real inroads to the amounts she owed Mutual. Loan 21 was 
taken over nine years after Mrs Cs first. So, the harmful pattern I think was 
established from loan 6 continued. Mrs C had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Mutual over a very long time.
I think that Mrs C lost out because Mutual continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Cs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mrs C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mrs Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 to 21 and Mutual should put things 
right.Mutual has referred to the 2020 High Court judgement in the case of Kerrigan vs Elevate 
Credit International Limited. It has essentially said that the judge in this case said that the 
relationship could be fair if there are a lower number of loans per year. For example, under 
four loans a year. It said, as it lent a lower amount than this, then this would indicate, on the 
same basis as the court case, that it hadnt lent unsustainably.
Firstly, looking at the courts findings at this point in the judgement, the judge was talking 
about whether an unfair relationship had developed. This is a different question, with some 
different considerations, than whether a loan or series of loans, has been lent irresponsibly.
I accept that there can be some overlap between whether a pattern of lending itself shows 
that the lending is unsustainable, and a relationship is unfair. But the court in this judgement 
was considering issues related to short term high cost credit rather than home collected 
credit. I can see Mutual has acknowledged they are different products with different 
considerations. And indeed has repeatedly been keen to distance its products from those of 
short term high cost credit providers. So, this means that the judges conclusions about a 
differently structured product shouldnt and cant be directly applied here.
And in any event the number of loans is just one aspect of decided whether a lending pattern 
is harmful. The loan size, duration of loans, the repayments and other factors need to be 
also looked at, as Ive done above.
So, whilst I have noted Mutuals submissions on this point, it hasnt introduced any 
arguments which persuade me to change my opinion about this complaint.
Putting things right
Mutual shouldnt have given Mrs C loans 6 to 21.
If Mutual has sold any outstanding debts Mutual should buy these back if it is able to do so 
and then take the following steps. If Mutual is not able to buy the debts back then Mutual 
should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) Mutual should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs C towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything 
it has already refunded.
B) Mutual should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs C 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs C originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Mutual should pay Mrs C the total of A plus B.
D) The overall pattern of Mrs Cs borrowing for loans 6 to 21 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Mrs Cs credit 
file. If Mutual has sold any of the loans it should ask the debt purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mutual to deduct tax from this interest. Mutual should 
give Mrs C a certificate showing how much tax Mutual has deducted, if she asks for one.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mrs Cs complaint.
Mutual Clothing and Supply Company Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 March 2022.
