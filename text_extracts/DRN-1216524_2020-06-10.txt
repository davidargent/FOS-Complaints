The complaint has been reviewed by two of our adjudicators. The first adjudicator upheld 
Miss Fs complaint from loan 6  as she thought the pattern of Miss Fs borrowing indicated 
she was reliant on short-term loans. 
Sunny disagreed but offered to uphold from loan 16 onwards instead. We put the offer to 
Miss F, but she declined it. 
In the most recent assessment, our adjudicator thought the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given as they thought Miss F wouldnt be able to make her repayments 
sustainably without borrowing more. This was as well as feeling Miss F was reliant on short-
term loans. Sunny didnt respond to this assessment so, the complaint was passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss F could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing 
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss F could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Fs complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our second adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to more when it approved loans 1 to 4. 
Miss F didnt respond to the view. As there no longer appears to be a dispute about these 
loans, I wont be making further findings on it.
Sunny says it carried out checks before it lent any of the loans to Miss F. As loan 5 was        
Miss Fs fifth loan in three months, I think Sunny ought to have been looking to build a clear 
picture than it did about her finances before lending to her. Such as verifying what Miss F 
has told it by asking to see copies of her bank statements and bills/payslips. 
Had it done this it would have likely found that Miss Fs outgoings at the time were around 
£908  but this amount didnt include food costs. Miss Fs declared income was £1,041  her 
bank statements show that her actual income was £1,056. This would have left her with a 
disposable income of £148 to cover her food costs plus her loan 5 repayment of £50.03, as 
well as any other expenditures. Given her income and expenditure, I think its unlikely that 
Miss F would have been able to sustain her loan repayments without having to borrow again. 
This was proven when Miss F borrowed again just four days after shed taken out loan 5. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss F, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Miss Fs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 10. I 
say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss F was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss F had taken out ten loans in five months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Miss F was having to borrow further to cover 
the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Fs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Fs first loan was for £100 and loan 10 was for the same amount.  At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that it was unlikely that Miss F was borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in her income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 10 onwards Miss F was provided with a new loan within weeks  
sometimes days - of taking out the previous one. 
Miss F wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 19 was 
taken out exactly 14 months after Miss Fs first. And it was for a larger amount. 
   Miss F had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period.
 I think that Miss F lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 10 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Fs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Miss F borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Miss Fs ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 5 to 19 and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss F paid on loans 5 to 19;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 5 to 9 from Miss Fs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 10 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 10 to 19 should be removed from 
Miss Fs credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Fs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss F to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 July 2020.
