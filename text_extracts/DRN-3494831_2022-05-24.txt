The complaint
Mr V is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA reported a missed payment to his
credit file after advising him that this wouldnt be the case.
What happened
On 1 September 2021, PayPal contacted Mr V by telephone and explained to him that the
monthly minimum payment for August 2021 had been missed because the direct debit
mandate being revoked. This meant that Mr Vs PayPal account was in arrears to the
amount of £3.25. Mr V was surprised by this and made a payment to clear the arrears and
bring his account back into line that same day. Mr V also made sure that future minimum
payments would be automatically paid moving forwards.
On the same telephone call, PayPal informed Mr V that the reason they had reached out to
him was to ensure that he didnt incur any fees or charges because of what happened and
also to ensure that his credit file was adversely impacted. However, Mr V later noticed that
PayPal had reported a missed payment for the month of August 2021 to his credit file. Mr V
wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mr Vs complaint. They noted the payment had been due in August 2021
and that Mr V hadnt made the corrective payment until 1 September 2021. As such, PayPal
felt theyd reported the missed payment correctly, and they didnt uphold Mr Vs complaint.
Mr V wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They noted that PayPals agent had told
Mr V they were contacting him to ensure that Mr V didnt incur adverse credit file reporting,
and so they felt that PayPal should honour that statement and remove the missed payment
reporting from Mr Vs credit file. Our investigator also felt that PayPal should make a
payment of £50 to Mr V to compensate him for the trouble and upset this matter had caused.
PayPal didnt agree that the missed payment reporting should be removed, so the matter
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 25 April 2022 as follows:
In their correspondence with this service, PayPal have stated that it wasnt the case 
that their agent told Mr V that they were calling him so as to avoid Mr V incurring 
adverse credit file reporting, but rather that the call to Mr V was being made to avoid 
adverse outcomes, which PayPal contend is a generalised statement that is open to 
interpretation.
However, having listened to the telephone call in question, its clear that PayPals 
agent specifically states that the reason that call to Mr V is being made is to:
avoid any late payment fees and charges or affecting your credit score.
As such, Im satisfied that the intention of PayPals call here was to try to help Mr V 
make the missed payment before any adverse consequences were incurred by Mr V, 
including the reporting of a missed payment to his credit file.
PayPals actions in this regard are commendable. Unfortunately, given that PayPal 
reported the missed payment to Mr Vs credit file on 31 August 2021, the telephone 
call to Mr V on 1 September 2021 appears to have been made a day too late.
Had PayPal made this call to Mr V slightly earlier, then Im satisfied that Mr V would 
have made the arrears clearing payment on that day (given that he did so on the 1 
September call) and so would have avoided the adverse credit file reporting that he 
ultimately incurred. As such, while I commend PayPals intentions, it doesnt feel fair 
to me that Mr V should incur adverse credit reporting because the call from PayPal 
was made to him too late.
PayPal may contend that it was Mr Vs responsibility as the account holder to monitor 
his account and to have rectified the situation that arose because of the revocation of 
the direct debit before their telephone call to him was made. Such logic seems 
reasonable to me, but it would also be expected that PayPal would try to contact Mr 
V to make him aware of the situation and to allow him to correct it before any adverse 
consequences were incurred.
PayPal did that here, and I note that PayPal sent Mr V an email confirming that the 
August 2021 payment had been missed as well as made the telephone call to Mr V 
on 1 September. But Mr V didnt see the email that PayPal sent. And unfortunately, 
the follow up telephone call that PayPal made was a day too late.
Ultimately, given the circumstances here, including that Mr V was told by PayPal that 
they were contacting him so as to avoid him incurring adverse credit file reporting, as 
well as the small amount of arrears in question and the fact that the payment was 
made only one day after the missed payment was reported, it doesnt feel fair to me 
that Mr V should incur a missed payment report on his credit file in this instance. As 
such, my provisional decision will include that PayPal must remove the adverse 
reporting from Mr Vs credit file and report the August 2021 payment as having been 
made on time.
However, I dont feel that PayPal have intentionally acted unfairly towards Mr V here, 
and PayPal are correct in stating that it is Mr Vs responsibility to monitor his account 
and ensure that scheduled payments are made on time. So, while I feel that a fair 
outcome here is the removal of the missed payment reporting, as explained above, 
my provisional decision wont include that PayPal should make any compensation 
payment to Mr V for what has taken place, as I dont feel that any such compensation 
payment is warranted in this instance.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr V and PayPal the opportunity to provide any 
new information they might wish me to consider before I moved to a final decision. Mr V 
confirmed he was happy to accept my provisional decision, whereas PayPal did not respond.As such, I see no reason not to issue a final decision upholding this complaint in Mr Vs 
favour on the basis described in my provisional decision letter above, and I can confirm that 
my final decision is that I do uphold this complaint in Mr Vs favour accordingly.
Putting things right
PayPal must remove the relevant missed payment reporting from Mr Vs credit file and report
the payment as having been made on time. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA on 
the basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 June 2022.
