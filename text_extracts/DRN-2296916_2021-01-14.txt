The complaint
Mr B complains that Bank of Ireland (UK) plc, trading as Post Office Financial Services and 
Post Office Money, wont refund to him the money that he paid for a replacement mobile 
phone when his phone was damaged.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr B used his Post Office Money credit card in December 2018 to buy a mobile 
phone but it suffered water damage when it was accidentally submerged in a 
swimming pool in May 2019;
he complained to the supplier and it replaced the phone at a cost to him of £237.09 
so he made a claim for a refund of that amount under section 75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974 in September 2019 but his claim wasnt made to the credit card 
company so he didnt receive a proper response;
he then complained to this service but our investigator said that there hadnt been a 
misrepresentation about the phone and there wasnt enough evidence to show that it 
wasnt of satisfactory quality so she said that she wouldnt recommend that Post 
Office Money should take any action;
Mr B says that the supplier advertised and marketed the phone as being able to 
resist water ingress to a depth of two metres for 30 minutes but his phone was 
accidentally submerged for less than two seconds to a depth of no more than 30 cm 
which caused water ingress so the supplier has made a false statement;
he also says that he checked the technical specifications before taking the phone 
near water and he doesnt believe it to be reasonable to have to have to check the 
disclaimers on the suppliers support website and that it was reasonable that he 
checked the technical specifications and marketing materials;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Bs complaint about Post Office Money, I must be satisfied 
that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the 
phone and that Post Office Moneys response to his claim under section 75 wasnt 
fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Bs claim under 
section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
I sympathise with Mr B for the issues that hes had with his phone and understand 
the frustration that he feels  but he complained to the supplier and accepted its offer 
to replace the phone at a cost to Mr B of £237.09;
although I can understand Mr Bs reliance on the phones technical specifications and 
marketing materials, Im not persuaded that theyre enough to show that the supplier 
gave any assurance or guarantee that the phone wouldnt suffer water damage if 
submerged and it referred to water resistance, not being waterproof;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the supplier 
misrepresented the phone to Mr B or that it has breached its contract with him; and
I consider that the suppliers response to his complaint was fair and reasonable in 
these circumstances and that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Post 
Office Money to refund to Mr B the £237.09 that he paid for the replacement phone, 
to pay him any other compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 February 2021.
