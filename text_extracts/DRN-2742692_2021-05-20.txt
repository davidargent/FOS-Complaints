The complaint
Ms S complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) mislaid a bond that they took out. Ms 
S says that when the bond matured it was moved to another account, but Barclays cant 
locate the funds.
Ms S is represented by her son Mr S in this complaint.
What happened
Ms S took out five bonds with Barclays starting in July 2010 and which matured between the 
2013 and 2020. 
In July 2020, Mr S telephoned Barclays to complain about the missing funds. Mr S also 
telephoned Barclays on 25 August 2020. Barclays investigated the complaint and issued a 
final response to Ms S on 4 September 2020.
In their final response, Barclays said that they could not find any bank error and didnt uphold 
the complaint. Barclays provided details on the bonds that had been taken out and said that 
the funds that Ms S said were missing were placed into a new bond on 9 July 2012. This 
bond matured on 13 July 2020.
Mr S and Ms S visited a Barclays branch on 4 September 2018 to discuss the complaint. 
They say that after several hours in the branch the manager credited their account with £50 
for distress and inconvenience. Mr S said that this did not resolve their issue.
Unhappy with Barclays decision, Ms S and Mr S have referred their complaint to the service. 
One of our investigators reviewed the complaint but didnt think that Barclays had done 
anything wrong and did not uphold the complaint.
Unhappy with the investigators view, Ms S and Mr S have asked for an ombudsman to look 
at their complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to disappoint Ms S and Mr S but I agree with the outcome reached by the 
investigator for much the same reasons and wont be upholding the complaint. I know that 
this will come as a disappointment to them so I will explain why I have reached this decision.
Ms S and Mr S took out several bonds and for ease of reading I have listed them below:
Bond Number Date Opened Date closed Amount 
13416097 28 May 2015 31 May 2017 £11,907.93
80590568 2 June 2018 4 June 2019 £12,081.25
73616495 2 August 2018 4 August 2020 £12,764.24
43625079 8 July 2010 July 2013 £25,972.75
13579018 9 July 2013 13 July 2020 £27,738.52 
In his submission to the service, Mr S said that two bonds were received and cashed 
(£12,500 and £27,738.52). Mr S only referred to four bonds that were taken out and it was 
one of the other two remaining bonds that were mis-appropriated but was unsure what bond 
was missing.
In their submission to the service, Barclays have provided documentation to the service on 
the detail behind the bonds that were taken out by Ms S and Mr S. I will deal with each one 
in turn.
Bond Number 13416097
This bond matured and was paid into Ms Ss bank account on 31 May 2017
Bond Number 80590568
This bond matured and was paid into Ms Ss bank account on 4 June 2019
Bond Number 73616495
This bond matured and was paid into Ms Ss bank account on 4 August 2020. The 
documentation shows that Ms S withdrew the same amount on 24 August with an intention 
to open another bond but changed her mind and cancelled the bond.
Bond Number 43625079
This bond matured and Ms S requested a cheque which was then cancelled. Instead, the 
funds were used to open a further bond (13579018).
Bond Number 13579018
This bond matured and was paid into Ms Ss bank account on 13 July 2020.
Having reviewed the documentation available to me it seems that the bond that matured in 
2013 (43625079) is the bond that Ms S and Mr S say was misplaced. In their initial 
submission to the service, they said that they had four bonds but from the documentation it 
appears that they had five bonds as the proceeds of the 2013 were rolled into a new bond 
and not paid into Ms Ss bank account as had happened previously.
In Mr Ss submission to the service following the investigators view, he said that the 
investigator had not mentioned two bonds  43625079 and 208915  43288110. I have 
looked at this and bond 43625079 has been covered off by the investigator and within this 
decision.
I have looked at the letter that Mr S has sent about bond 208915  43288110. This reference 
takes a different format than the other bonds and the investigator has replied to Mr S. The 
investigator said that this was a bond that matured and changed to an Everyday Saver. 
This bond was the subject of discussion when Ms S and Mr S visited the branch. Barclays 
added two months interest payments as it was in the Everyday Saver and not within the 
bond. Barclays issued a final response letter on 4 September 2018 and offered the £50 
compensation previously mentioned in this decision.I sympathise with Ms S and Mr S that they didnt get answers from Barclays when they 
visited the branch on 4 September 2018 but as I havent seen any evidence that any of the 
bonds were misplaced, I cant say that Barclays have acted unfairly
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 June 2021.
