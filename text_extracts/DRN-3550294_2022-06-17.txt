The complaint
Miss J complains that Advantage Insurance Company Limited mishandled a claim on her
motor insurance policy.
Where I refer to Advantage, I include the insurance intermediary and others insofar as I hold
Advantage responsible for their acts or omissions.
What happened
For the year from late November 2016, Miss J took out a car policy through an intermediary.
Advantage was the insurance company that was responsible for setting premiums and
dealing with any claim. The premium for the year was going to be about £800.00.
In April 2017, Miss Js car and a third partys vehicle were involved in an incident.
Miss J made a claim on her policy. At first, Advantage thought her car was repairable. Later
Advantage said the car was a total loss. It paid Miss J its pre-accident value of £6,320.00,
less the policy excess of £345.00.
On 10 May 2017, Advantage noted a change of address. The premium for the year was
going to be increased by about £310.00 to about £1,130.00.
On about 28 May 2017, Miss J got a replacement car and put it on the policy. The premium
for the year was going to be increased by about £450.00 to about £1,580.00.
The third party (through his insurer) made a claim against Miss J.
Miss J took out a new policy with Advantage for the year from late November 2017. The cost
for the year was going to be about £2,900.00. That included about £400.00 interest. Miss J
agreed to pay by 11 instalments of about £264.00 starting from late December 2017.
Advantage investigated the third partys claim. It decided that it had enough evidence to tell
the third partys lawyers that it wouldnt pay his claim.
On 20 July 2018 Advantage noted another change of address for Miss J.
Miss J moved overseas. She cancelled her policy with effect from 13 August 2018. I think
that, by that time, she wouldve paid 8 instalments of about £264.00 on each of the 8
payment dates from late December 2017 to late July 2018. Thats a total of about £2,112.00.
Advantage refunded £174.14.
In early July 2020, Advantage closed Miss Js claim as a fault claim against her - but didnt
tell Miss J.
In mid-March 2021, Miss J's mother called Advantage for an update on the claim, Advantage
told her it had closed the claim as a fault claim against Miss J. But Advantage decided it
would change the status of the claim to non-fault.
Advantage retrospectively reduced Miss J's premium and refunded £560.68 for the period
from November 2017.
In July 2021, Miss J complained to Advantage that it hadnt done enough to keep her
informed. She also complained that Advantage had wrongly labelled her at fault, so for 8
months she had been paying an at fault premium, costing her an extra £1,469.00.
By a final response dated August 2021, Advantage upheld Miss Js complaint in part.
Advantage refunded £218.68 for the year from November 2016. Advantage said it was also
sending a cheque for £150.00 as an apology.
Unhappy with that, Miss J brought her complaint to us without delay.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. He thought that
Advantage couldnt prove the premiums were accurate or fair. He said he couldnt assess
which increases have been affected by the claim and which are independent from it. He
recommended that Advantage should pay Miss J:
1. for the year 2016/17 a refund of any premiums she had paid above her original 2016 
policy premium of £821.17; and
2. for the year 2017/18 a proportional refund of any premiums calculated from £821.17, 
minus any cancellation fees and the refund of £174.14 already given; and
3. 8% simple interest per year on the refunds from the date she paid the premiums until 
the settlement is paid.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Miss J   
and to Advantage on 28 April 2022. I summarise my findings:
Advantage paid Miss J about £6,000.00 in settlement of her claim. Advantage 
recovered only the salvage value of her damaged car. Advantage didnt recover its 
outlay in full. So I wouldnt have found that Advantage had treated Miss J unfairly if it 
had continued to record her claim as a fault claim.
Advantage shouldve communicated with Miss J better throughout the claim and on 
its closure in 2020.
However, Advantage had taken the following steps in Miss Js favour:
It changed the record of the claim from fault to non-fault, allowing it for her no-
claims bonus.
It sent her a cheque for £560.68 for the period from November 2017.
It sent her a cheque for £218.68 for the year from November 2016.
It sent her a cheque for £150.00.As Advantage confirmed those steps in a final response letter, I found it fair and 
reasonable to hold Advantage to them. But I considered that those steps went 
beyond what Advantage was obliged to do. So I was minded that they were 
compensatory.
The shortcomings in Advantages communication caused Miss J worry about what 
was happening. I didnt under-estimate that impact. But I was minded that the steps 
Advantage had taken were enough compensation.
I didnt think Miss J had paid in the cheques
Subject to any further information from Miss J or from Advantage, my provisional decision 
was that I intended to direct Advantage Insurance Company Limited to pay Miss J (insofar 
as it hasnt already paid her) the following amounts:
1. £560.68 in partial refund for the period from November 2017; and
2. £216.68 in partial refund for the year from November 2016; and
3. £150.00 for distress and inconvenience.
Miss J agreed with the provisional decision.
Advantage hasnt responded to the provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Financial Ombudsman Service is bound by the Financial Conduct Authoritys dispute
resolution rules. The effect of one of those rules is that a consumer must first make a
complaint to the financial firm and wait for up to 8 weeks for a final response before we can
investigate that complaint.
An insurance company may make an outlay either on a claim from its policyholder or to
settle a claim from a third party. Its common practice that where an insurance company has
made an outlay, it will record the claim as a faut claim against its policyholder unless and
until it recovers its outlay in full, typically from a third partys insurer.
There may be a number of reasons why an insurance company cannot recover its outlay. It
follows that an insurance company may record a fault claim against its policyholder even if
she wasnt at faut in causing the accident.
Any claim  and especially a fault claim - is likely to increase future premiums.
Miss J hasnt complained about the premium increases in May 2017. And in any event, I find
it unlikely that Advantage made those increases because of the open claim before the date
when the policy would expire (or need renewal) in November 2017.
Advantage paid Miss J about £6,000.00 in settlement of her claim. Advantage recovered
only the salvage value of her damaged car. Advantage didnt recover its outlay in full. So I wouldnt have found that Advantage had treated Miss J unfairly if it had continued to 
record her claim as a fault claim  and charged premiums accordingly.
Advantage shouldve communicated with Miss J better throughout the claim and on its
closure in 2020.
However, Advantage has taken the following steps in Miss Js favour:
It changed the record of the claim from fault to non-fault, allowing it for her no-
claims bonus.
It sent her a cheque for £560.68 for the period from November 2017.
It sent her a cheque for £218.68 for the year from November 2016.
It sent her a cheque for £150.00.
As Advantage confirmed those steps in a final response letter, I find it fair and reasonable to
hold Advantage to them. 
But I consider that those steps go beyond what Advantage was obliged to do. I dont 
consider that Advantage was obliged to change the claim to non-fault. So it wouldnt have 
been obliged to make any refund of premium on making such a change. In any event, Ive 
found it unlikely that the premium increases before November 2017 were because of the 
open claim.
So I consider that the steps Advantage took were compensation for Miss J. 
Putting things right
The shortcomings in Advantages communication caused Miss J worry about what was
happening. I dont under-estimate that impact. But I conclude that the steps Advantage has 
taken are enough compensation.
Miss J has shown us that she still has the original three cheques dated summer 2021. And I 
dont think she will be able to pay them into her account about a year later. So I will direct 
Advantage to pay her their amounts insofar as it hasnt already done so. I dont find it fair 
and reasonable to direct Advantage to do any more in response to this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I direct Advantage Insurance 
Company Limited to pay Miss J (insofar as it hasnt already paid her) the following amounts:
1. £560.68 in partial refund for the period from November 2017; and
2. £218.68 in partial refund for the year from November 2016; and
3. £150.00 for distress and inconvenience. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2022.
