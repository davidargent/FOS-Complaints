K820x#14complaint
Its been agreed in this case  that Financial Insurance Company Limited (FICL),  as the 
insurer, should accept  responsibility for the complaint. To keep things simple, Ill refer to 
FICL as the seller  in my decision.
Mrs D says FICL mis-sold  her a payment protection insurance (PPI)  policy.
background
This complaint is about a PPI policy  taken  out alongside a store  card in 2002.
Our Adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Mrs D disagreed with the adjudicators opinion 
so the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Ds case.
Ive decided the policy wasnt mis-sold and Ill explain why.
FICL had to make Mrs D aware the PPI was optional and gain her consent before adding  the 
policy to her card. I cant be certain  what was said at the time Mrs D applied for her card and 
PPI but FICL has provided a copy of the available paperwork. The application form Mrs D 
completed when  she applied for her card had a separate section  for PPI which Mrs D has 
signed separately to agreeing with the card itself. With this in mind I think FICL made it clear 
that Mrs D didnt have  to take out the PPI and that she chose to take it out  although I can 
understand why she may not remember this.
FICL didnt  recommend the PPI to Mrs D so it didnt have to check if it was right for her. But 
it did have to make sure Mrs D got the information she needed to decide  if it was right for 
her. 
Its possible the information FICL gave Mrs D about the PPI wasnt as clear as it shouldve 
been. But she chose  to take out the PPI knowing the other means  she had of making her 
repayments which included sick pay. But the PPI would have paid out in addition  to Mrs Ds 
sick pay, and for longer than she would  have received full pay.
Based on what Ive seen  of Mrs Ds circumstances  at the time it doesnt look like she was 
affected by any of the exclusions  to or limits  on the PPI cover  - so it would have been useful 
for her if something went wrong. It also looks like the PPI was affordable.  So I dont think 
better information about the PPI would  have put her off taking  out the cover.  
Which means FICL doesnt have to pay back the cost of the PPI to Mrs D.
Ive thought about everything Mrs D has said - including  that FICL had previously upheld her 
complaint. FICL has explained that this was an error, and as I dont think the policy was mis-
sold these points dont  change my decision.
