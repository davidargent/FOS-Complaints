Mr T says Elevate  Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny) didnt carry out sufficient 
checked before giving him these loans.  Had it done so, it wouldve seen that he couldnt 
afford to repay them.

In our adjudicators latest findings  he thought Sunny had treated Mr T fairly when it gave him 
loans 1  4. However, he didnt think that any of the remaining loans shouldve been  
provided.  
By loan 5, the adjudicator  thought Sunnys checks needed to go further.  And had further 
checks been carried out it wouldve likely  shown Sunny that Mr T wasnt  in a position to take 
on this loan because  he was in receipt of benefits and his outgoings exceeded his income. 
The adjudicator also thought a pattern of lending had been  established  by loan 5 as well, 
and as there was no change  in Mr Ts circumstances, so he didnt think he could afford  to 
take on any of the remaining loans. 
Mr T appears to have accepted the adjudicators findings.  
Ref: DRN12154142However, Sunny didnt  accept the adjudicators findings. It made a number of points 
including that it carried out affordability  checks and just because  Mr T was on benefits that 
wouldnt automatically lead it to decline an application for a loan. But it did accept that the 
way Mr T used  these may have  been an indication of a problem,  so it made an offer to 
uphold loans  20  23. 
Mr T rejected Sunnys offer and as no agreement could be reached,  the case has been 
passed to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Both Mr T and Sunny appear  to have accepted the adjudicators findings about loans 1  4. 
Because there doesnt appear  to be an outstanding dispute about  these loans  I wont  be 
making a finding  on these  loans in this decision.  
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to figure out whether 
Mr T could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So Sunny was required to establish  whether  Mr T could sustainably  repay his loans   not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  Mr T could 
sustainably make his repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
Ref: DRN12154143Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, proportionate checks for loans 5 would most likely have shown 
that:
Mr Ts actual income was significantly less then what Sunny believed  it to be, and 
with his monthly expenditure (which includes living  costs as well as repayments to a 
number of credit card providers)  he didnt have enough to be able to afford the 
repayments he was committed  to make. So, in these circumstances, there was a 
significant risk that Mr T wouldnt  have  been  able to repay  this loan or any further 
loan without undue difficulty  or without the need to borrow  again. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 and Sunny should put things right as detailed  
below.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T and I also think  
that Sunny should reasonably have seen that he was unlikely to have been  able to make his 
loan repayments  in a sustainable  manner by the time it provided loan six. I say this because:
by this stage, Mr T was into his third month  of owing  Sunny money.  In my view, 
Mr Ts loan history  up until this point was in itself a clear  demonstration of his inability 
to settle his loans over the life of the credit  agreement.
Mr T continued  to be provided  with new loans shortly after having repaid previous 
ones. And the amounts he was borrowing werent decreasing. So Sunny ought  to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr T was having to borrow further to cover  
the hole the repayment of his previous loans left in his finances  and that Mr Ts 
indebtedness wasnt decreasing and so the loans  were  unsustainable. 
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads into what he owed Sunny and his indebtedness  
was being prolonged  for an extended period of time. Loan 23 was provided more 
than a year after Mr Ts first loan and it his combined outstanding balance at the time 
was almost the same amount as Mr Ts first loan. This meant  that Mr T paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect;  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Mr T lost out because Sunny provided  loans 7 - 23 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time; 
and
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ts ability  to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im partly upholding Mr Ts complaint and Sunny should put things right as set out below.
Ref: DRN12154144putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  5 to 23;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Mr Ts credit file
remove all entries about  loans 6 - 23 from Mr Ts credit file. The period of time Mr T 
owed Sunny money means that any information still recorded about these loans is 
adverse.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ts complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr T as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 November  2019.
