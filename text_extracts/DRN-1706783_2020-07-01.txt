The complaint
Mr J complains that a hire purchase agreement under which a car was supplied to him was 
mis-sold to him by PSA Finance UK Limited, trading as Peugeot Financial Services, and 
about the charges that it has made when he returned the car at the end of the agreement. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mr J in November 2015 under a hire purchase agreement 
with Peugeot Financial Services in which he agreed to make 36 monthly payments of 
£137.80 and a final payment of £5,097 for the car;
hes provided no evidence to show that hed agreed to pay for the car in another way 
and the evidence clearly shows that there were discussions about the terms of the 
hire purchase agreement over a period of more than two weeks before he collected 
the car;
he says that he input his signature on a screen but I consider that its reasonable to 
expect someone to check what theyre being asked to sign before signing it and that 
it was Mr Js responsibility to check that the agreement reflected his understanding of 
what had been agreed before signing it;
I consider that he knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that the car was being 
supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement and that, if he hadnt received a 
copy of the agreement, it would be reasonable in these circumstances to expect him 
to have asked for one;
Mr J was able to use the car for more than three years and in that time he drove 
15,728 miles in it but Ive seen no evidence to show that he complained to Peugeot 
Financial Services that the agreement had been mis-sold to him until after hed 
returned the car;
the terms and conditions of the agreement said: In the event that you do not wish to 
exercise your right to purchase the Vehicle, you will be required to immediately return 
the vehicle. In the event that you do not return the Vehicle to us in good condition 
 you will be liable for the cost of any repairs or maintenance required to be carried 
out  and good condition was defined in those terms and conditions;
I consider that to be a reasonable requirement and Im not persuaded that it was 
reasonable for Mr J to believe that he could return the car in a damaged or 
unsatisfactory condition without being liable for it;
the car was collected from him and inspected in January 2019 by a third party on 
behalf of Peugeot Financial Services and charges totalling £555 were recommended 
for an incomplete service history, an aborted collection fee, a missing compressor, 
two scuffed wheels and a dented quarter panel;
Mr J was charged for that by Peugeot Financial Services but he complained to it 
about a number of issues, including that the agreement had been mis-sold to him 
and the amount that hed been charged after the car had been collected from him  it 
agreed to waive the £135 that it had charged him for the aborted collection fee which 
reduced the charges to £420; 
Ive reviewed the photos of the damage shown in the inspection report and I consider 
that its more than would reasonably be considered to be fair wear and tear and that 
the car wasnt returned in a good condition  and Ive seen no evidence to show 
that the car had been serviced as required - so Im not persuaded that  the charges 
totalling £420 have been made incorrectly;
I have considered Mr Js detailed response to the investigators recommendations 
but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the agreement was 
mis-sold to him or that Peugeot Financial Services has acted incorrectly in any 
significant way in its dealings with him; and
although I sympathise with Mr J for the difficulties that hes described, I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Peugeot 
Financial Services to further reduce or waive the amount that its charged Mr J, to 
pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint. 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Js complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2020.
