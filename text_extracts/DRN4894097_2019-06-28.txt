K821x#15complaint
Mr S says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 50 payday  loans  QuickQuid provided to Mr S between  
November 2009  and November 2012. Some information about the loans is attached as an 
appendix at the end of this decision.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr S complaint and thought that none  of the 50 loans should have 
been given. QuickQuid disagreed and offered to redress  some  of the loans. Mr S didnt  
accept the offer and so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN48940972Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading (OFT) guidance defined sustainable as 
being without  undue  difficulties  in particular without incurring or increasing problem 
indebtedness, over the life of the credit agreement , out of income and/or savings and 
without having  to realise security or assets.  And it follows  that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if they cant do so without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr S complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, Mr S was in an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) at the 
time of the first loan. QuickQuid has said it searched Mr S credit file  although it hasnt 
provided this service with the results of its search.  QuickQuid has told this service that its 
credit searches check delinquent records of customers  before  it lends.  It therefore  seems 
likely that it would have  found that Mr S was in an active IVA at the time of loan 1 and that 
Mr S was likely to be struggling financially. In the circumstances, it was unlikely that Mr S 
would be able to sustainably repay  the loan and any subsequent loans. So QuickQuid 
shouldnt have been lending to him.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr S to see if there 
was a point at which QuickQuid should  reasonably  have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr S case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
By loan 7, Mr S had been  borrowing regularly from QuickQuid for around  7 months. In those 
seven months he was either borrowing or repaying  a loan. There  were  no significant  breaks  
in lending  there was a gap of less than two months between  loans  5 and 6, but I dont think 
that gap was sufficient enough for QuickQuid  to reasonably believe that Mr S wasnt reliant 
on the loans. Also, from loan 1, the loan amounts were generally increasing. From loan 7 
onwards Mr S was provided with a new loan within a short  time of settling a previous one 
and in some  instances  he was lent a new loan on the day he repaid a previous loan. So 
QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more likely than not Mr S was having to borrow  
further to cover the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and that 
Mr S indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Also, Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid. Loan 50 was 
taken out 36 months  after Mr S first, it was for a larger  amount and Mr S had been 
consistently borrowing  for around  three  years. Mr S had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in 
effect, service a debt to QuickQuid over an extended period.
High-cost short term loans are unsuitable  for extended use and even QuickQuid  
acknowledges that its loans arent  meant as a long term solution to cash  flow problems. I 
think Mr S pattern of borrowing made it clear that he was using the loans as a supplement  
for his income over a long period of time. As a responsible lender, QuickQuid shouldnt have 
been lending  to him in the circumstances.
Ref: DRN48940973QuickQuid continued  to provide borrowing to Mr S from loan 7 onwards and he has lost out  
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr S indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr S 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 7 to 50 and QuickQuid should put things 
right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 1 to 50;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 1 to 6 from Mr S credit file;
the number  of loans taken from 7 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loan 7 to 50 should be removed from Mr S 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr S complaint. CashEuroNet  Uk LLC should 
pay Mr S compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 July 2019.
