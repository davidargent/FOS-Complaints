K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains that Active Securities  Limited,  trading  as 247 Moneybox, (ASL), 
irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 50 payday  loans  ASL provided to Mr H between  May 2011 and 
August 2018.  All of the loans have been  repaid. A summary of Mr Hs lending  history is set 
out in the Appendix below.
our adjudicators view
Mr Hs complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think ASL had 
been wrong to give Loans  1 to 6 and Loans  22 to 26 to Mr H. But he recommended that 
Mr Hs complaint about Loans 7 to 21 and 27 to 50 should be upheld. 
ASL disagreed  and responded to say that there  was a gap of approximately  five months 
between Loans  20 and 21. It said that this amount of time was sufficient for ASL to review 
Loan 21 without  considering Mr Hs prior lending history as it was possible that his financial 
circumstances had changed in that time.  
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr H 
and to ASL on 11 September 2019.  I summarise my findings:
Id said that it wasnt  clear to me from ASLs response to the adjudicators  view whether ASL 
had accepted that Loans 7 to 21 and Loan 27 onwards should be upheld.  So Id asked the 
adjudicator to check this with ASL. As ASL hadnt responded, I said that I would review  all 
the loans in my decision.
Id noted that when  ASL first lent to Mr H the regulator was the Office  of Fair Trading and 
relevant guidance included  its guidance on irresponsible lending (ILG). From 1 April 2014 
onwards the regulator was the Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA) and relevant regulations 
and guidance  included its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC). The ILG and CONC 
contained similar guidance  for lenders about responsible lending. 
ASL needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  
this meant  that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I thought  less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that ASL should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors included:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN53943992the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer had been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated  
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Id said that there might  even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending 
itself clearly demonstrated that the lending was unsustainable.
I thought that it was important to say that ASL was required to establish whether Mr H could  
sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But I said that it didnt automatically 
follow this was the case. This was because  the Consumer Credit  Sourcebook  
(CONC) defines sustainable  as being without undue difficulties and in particular the 
consumer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. And it follows  
that a lender should realise, or it ought  fairly  and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont  
be able to make their repayments  sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their 
repayments without  borrowing  further. 
Id carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all meant for Mr Hs complaint.
Id noted that ASL had made a number of checks before it lent to Mr H. From Loan 23 it 
asked him for details  of his income  and expenditure. ASLs  file showed  Mr Hs initial 
declared monthly income as £2,652 for Loans 23 to 25 which increased to £3,184  for 
Loan 50. And Mr H had declared his expenditure as around between  £1,100  and £1,640 for 
Loans 23 onwards.  ASL hadnt provided this service with any income  and expenditure 
information for Loans 1 to 22.
ASL had also said it had checked Mr Hs credit file before agreeing to the loans. But ASL 
had only provided  us with the results of its credit  checks for some of the loans from Loan 6. 
We had also received a copy  of Mr Hs credit  report which Id referred to in my provisional  
decision. But Id noted that it didnt cover the earlier loans.
Loans 1 to 4
ASL hadnt provided us with any of the information it had used to assess the applications for 
Loans 1 to 4, so I couldnt say that it had made proportionate checks before providing  these 
loans to Mr H. In order to assess what proportionate  checks  would have likely shown, and in 
the absence of any information  ASL had used in its assessment, Id said that I would 
normally look at the borrowers bank statements. Unfortunately Id not seen  Mr Hs bank 
statements for the months before Loans 1 to 4. So I couldnt say that if ASL had completed 
sufficient checks, it would have found  that Mr H couldnt afford to repay Loans 1 to 4 
sustainably. So I couldnt say that ASL was wrong to give Loans 1 to 4 to Mr H.
Loan 5
Ref: DRN53943993Mr H took out Loan 5 ten days after hed repaid Loan 4. The loan amount had increased as 
had the amount of each of each  of his previous loans. Loan 5 was Mr Hs fifth loan in less 
than three  months,  with each loan being  taken within ten days  of the previous  loan being  
repaid. I thought ASL should  have been concerned that Mr H may have been reliant on its 
lending. And I didnt think it was reasonable for ASL to base its assessment before Loan 5 
on the information provided by Mr H without taking steps to independently  check what hed 
declared. So I thought it might  have been proportionate at this time for ASL to have 
independently reviewed the true state  of Mr Hs finances. I couldnt see that ASL did this as 
wed not received  any of the information it used to assess the application for Loan 5. 
In order to assess what proportionate checks would have likely shown, Id said I would 
normally look at the borrowers bank statements. Unfortunately Id not seen  Mr Hs bank 
statements for the month before  Loan 5. So I couldnt say that if ASL had completed 
sufficient checks, it would have found  that Mr H couldnt afford to repay Loan 5 sustainably. 
So I couldnt  say that ASL was wrong  to give Loan 5 to Mr H.
Loan 6
Loan 6 was taken out on the date Loan 5 was repaid and the loan amount had increased  to 
£425. I thought  the repeated increases  in loan amounts and that Mr H took a new loan so 
soon after repaying  Loan 5 should  have caused  some concerns to ASL. Loan 6 was also 
Mr Hs third loan that month  and his sixth loan in just over three months.  Mr H wasnt 
showing any signs of getting  to grips with his borrowing. There was an emerging pattern 
between Loans  1 and 5 of Mr H taking  new loans shortly after repaying  previous ones. I 
thought that by Loan 6, ASL ought  fairly and reasonably to have regarded  that pattern as 
established. I thought this indicated that Mr H was becoming dependent  on this type of 
borrowing.
Whilst Id not seen Mr Hs income  and expenditure information, ASL had provided its credit  
check before  Loan 6. The check  showed  that Mr H had nine active  accounts and had 
opened 17 accounts in the previous  six months.  Moreover the credit check  appeared to 
show that Mr H had three open  short  term loans  with other  short term lenders and on one of 
the loans, Mr H had borrowed £1,000.  I thought the high lending frequency  as well as ASLs 
credit checks suggested that Mr H was facing  problems managing his money. So I didnt 
think it was reasonable  for ASL to conclude that Loan 6 was sustainable for Mr H. 
Loans 7 to 21
Id also looked  at the overall pattern of ASLs lending history  with Mr H, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point  at which  ASL should reasonably  have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so ASL should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I thought  that this point was reached by 
Loan 7. I said this because:
By Loan  7, Mr H had been borrowing from ASL for over seven months.  
Most  of the loans  had been  taken  within ten days of the previous loan being repaid.
There were  some  small gaps between loans being repaid and a new loan being  
granted. But, I didnt  think  it would have  been  reasonable  for ASL to have concluded  
Ref: DRN53943994these gaps were any indication that Mr Hs finances  had moved  on from whatever 
situation had required his previous loans.
I could see that as ASL didnt stop lending at this point, Mr H went on to regularly take out 
high cost loans  for a further 26 months.  
Id noted that there was a gap of around  four and a half months  between  the repayment  of 
Loan 20 and Loan 21 being  taken out. But I didnt think it would have been reasonable for 
ASL to have seen this gap as an indication that Mr Hs finances had moved on from 
whatever situation  had required  his previous  loans. There had been an established period of 
borrowing before  Loan 21 which I thought ASL ought to have been  concerned  about 
irrespective of the length of pause between Loan  20 and 21. So Id treated Loan 21 as part 
of the same  chain of lending as Mr Hs previous loans.
I thought that Mr H had lost out because ASL continued to provide borrowing from Loans  7 
to 21 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Hs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
The fact that all the loans were repaid didnt  mean that they were repaid sustainably,  
or without causing Mr H undue difficulty. 
I could see that there were gaps of around  14 months between Loan  21 being repaid and 
Loan 22, and around  10 months  between  Loan 22 being repaid and Loan 23. I thought  it 
was reasonable  for ASL to have considered these gaps in lending  as indications that Mr H 
wasnt reliant on its loans,  and for it to have effectively treated Mr H as a new customer on 
each of these  loans.  
Loan 22
I couldnt see that this service had received any of the information ASL had used to assess 
the application for Loan 22 other than a summary  of its credit checks. But Id not seen 
anything in the results  of those credit checks that I thought should  have  caused  ASL 
additional concerns about Mr Hs financial situation. Nevertheless I couldnt  say that it had 
made proportionate  checks  before providing  Loan 22 to Mr H. In order  to assess  what 
proportionate checks would have likely shown, and in the absence of any income information 
ASL used in its assessment, I said that I would  normally  look at the borrowers bank 
statements. I could see from Mr Hs bank statements in the month before Loan 22 that hed 
received an income  of around £2,570. I thought it was likely  that he would have declared this 
amount to ASL if asked. Id noted  that the loan amount was £150.  I couldnt see that wed 
received information  about the contractual loan repayment amount but I didnt think  the 
repayment amount  would have been  so large  that it was obvious it wouldve caused Mr H 
financial difficulty.
Ref: DRN53943995So given Mr Hs likely repayment amount and what was apparent about his circumstances  at 
the time,  I didnt think it wouldve been  proportionate for ASL to have asked him for the 
amount of information  that would have  been  needed  to show the lending was unsustainable.  
And Id said that there wasnt anything in the information Mr H provided or the information 
ASL shouldve  been aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying  
what he was saying.  So I didnt think ASL was wrong to give Loan 22 to Mr H.
Loan 23
Id noted that the loan amount was £200.  Mr H had declared a disposable income  of £1,552.  
I couldnt see that wed received information  about  the contractual  loan repayment amount 
but I didnt think  the repayment would have been so large that it was obvious  it wouldve 
caused Mr H financial difficulty.
Id noted that ASL had provided a summary of its credit check before Loan 23. But Id not 
seen anything in the results  of those credit checks that I thought  should have caused  ASL 
additional concerns about Mr Hs financial situation. 
So given Mr Hs likely repayment amount and what was apparent about his circumstances  at 
the time,  I didnt think it wouldve been  proportionate for ASL to have asked him for the 
amount of information  that would have  been  needed  to show the lending was unsustainable.  
And Id said there wasnt anything in the information  Mr H provided or the information  ASL 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying. So I didnt  think  ASL was wrong  to give Loan  23 to Mr H.
 
Loans 24 and 25
Mr H took out Loan 24 around a fortnight after hed repaid Loan 23, but the amount hed 
borrowed had tripled to £600.  I couldnt  see that wed received information  about the 
contractual loan repayment amount. Id not seen  the results  of ASLs  credit check before  
Loan 24. Mr H had declared his disposable income  to be £1,402.  But as the likely loan 
repayment was a significant  proportion  of Mr Hs income, I thought it might have been 
proportionate at that time for ASL to have gathered some  further  information  from Mr H 
about his other short  term borrowing. I thought it would also have been proportionate for ASL 
to have made the same checks before Loan 25 for the same  reasons. Had it done so, I said 
that it was likely that ASL wouldve learnt that Mr H had two outstanding short term loans 
with total monthly  repayments of around  £320. On balance, I didnt think  these suggested 
that Mr H was having significant  difficulties  managing his money. So I couldnt  safely say that 
ASL shouldnt  have given Loans 24 and 25 to Mr H. 
Loan 26
The loan amount for Loan 26 had increased  again to £647. But as the loan amount was a 
significant proportion  of Mr Hs declared income  and the loan was Mr Hs fourth loan in under 
three months, I thought ASL should have been concerned that Mr H might have been  reliant  
on its lending. And I didnt think it was reasonable for ASL to base its assessment before 
Loan 26 on the information  provided  by Mr H without taking steps to independently check 
what hed declared.  So I thought it might  have been  proportionate  at that time for ASL to 
Ref: DRN53943996have independently reviewed the true state  of Mr Hs finances.  This was to make sure Mr H 
was in a position to make the repayments sustainably. As far as I could see ASL didnt do 
this. So I needed  to think about what ASL wouldve seen if it had carried  out proportionate 
checks. Mr H had provided some information about  his financial circumstances which  
included his credit  report and bank statements. But having looked  at these, I couldnt safely  
say that ASL wouldve seen that Mr H couldnt  sustainably make the repayment for Loan  26. 
So I didnt uphold his complaint about  this loan. 
Loans 27 and 28
The loan amounts for Loans 27 and 28 were  again  a significant proportion  of Mr Hs 
declared income and the loans were both taken out within three weeks of the previous loan 
being repaid. Again  I thought ASL should have been concerned that Mr H might have been  
reliant on its lending.  And I didnt  think it was reasonable for ASL to base its assessment 
before Loans  27 and 28 on the information provided by Mr H without taking steps to 
independently check what hed declared. So I thought it again might  have  been  
proportionate at that time for ASL to have independently reviewed the true state of Mr Hs 
finances. Had it done so, I said it was likely that ASL wouldve learnt that Mr H had around 
three outstanding other short term loans with other lenders with repayments due at the same 
time as Loans 27 and 28. I could see these  on Mr Hs own credit report. So I thought ASL 
ought to have realised it was likely  that Mr H was having problems managing  his money  and 
it was unlikely Mr H wouldve been able to sustainably repay Loans 27 and 28. So I thought  
ASL was wrong  to give Loans 27 and 28 to Mr H.
Loans 29 to 50
Id also looked  at the overall pattern of ASLs lending history  since Loan 22 with 
Mr H, with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which  ASL should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so ASL should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I thought  that this point was reached by 
Loan 29. I said this because:
By Loan  29, Mr H had borrowed seven loans from ASL in just over five months,  with 
a loan being taken out every month. 
All of the loans  had been  taken  within  three  weeks of the previous loan being repaid.
There were  some  small gaps between loans being repaid and a new loan being  
granted. But, I didnt  think  it would have  been  reasonable  for ASL to have concluded  
these gaps were any indication that Mr Hs finances  had moved  on from whatever 
situation had required his previous loans.
I could see that as ASL didnt stop lending at this point, Mr H went on to take out high cost 
loans for a further 26 months. 
I thought that Mr H had lost out because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN53943997the length of time that Mr H had been taking out short term loans was likely  to have 
had negative implications on Mr Hs ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
The fact that all the loans were repaid didnt  mean that they were repaid sustainably,  
or without causing Mr H undue difficulty. 
I also said that when  a consumer borrowed numerous loans over a long period of time, it 
was most likely that the loans werent being used for their intended purpose of temporary 
cash flow problems. Id said that ASL would know that the FCA had made it clear in a recent  
letter to CEOs of high cost lending firms  that a high volume of relending..may  be 
symptomatic of unsustainable lending patterns. And Id thought  that was the case  here.
So I concluded that subject to any further  information or evidence I might  receive  from the 
parties, I intended to uphold this complaint in part. I intended to order Active Securities 
Limited, trading  as 247 Moneybox, to:
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on Loans 6 to 21 and Loans  27 to 50;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse entries about Loans  6, 27 and 28 from Mr Hs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 7 to 21 and Loan 29 to 50 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about these loans should 
be removed from Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires ASL to take off tax from this interest. ASL must  give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Mr H responded to my provisional decision to say that he accepted my provisional  decision. 
ASL responded to my provisional decision to say that it had nothing further to add.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Given that Mr H has accepted my provisional decision and ASL has given me nothing  further  
to consider, I see no reason to depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional 
decision. It follows that I uphold part of the complaint and require  ASL to pay Mr H some 
compensation as set out below.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement of this 
complaint, I order Active  Securities Limited,  trading  as 247 Moneybox,  to:
Ref: DRN539439981.Refund all interest  and charges Mr H paid on Loans 6 to 21 and Loans 27 to 50;
2.Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
3.Remove any adverse  entries about  Loans  6, 27 and 28 from Mr Hs credit  file; 
and
4.The number of loans  taken from Loan 7 to 21 and Loan 29 to 50 means  any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about these loans 
should be removed  from Mr Hs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires ASL to take off tax from this interest. ASL must  give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 November  2019.
