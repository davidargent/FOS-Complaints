Sunny has agreed  to uphold Mr Ls complaint about loan 1 and it has offered to refund all the 
interest and charges he paid on this loan. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ls complaint and thought loan 6 and 10 also shouldnt 
have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr L could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN50137392the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments  on 
time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to 
meet the repayments. And it follows  that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint.
There was a significant break in Mr Ls borrowing from Sunny. There was a gap of around 18 
months between loans 6 and 7. I think it would be reasonable  for Sunny to view this gap as 
an indication  that Mr Ls finances had stabilised after whatever the circumstances that had 
caused him to take out his previous  loans.  So, I will look at Mr Ls borrowing in two separate 
lending chains. 
The first chain was made up of loans 1 to 6, and the second chain was loans 7 to 10. Sunny 
has agreed to uphold loan 1 so I wont consider that any further but will take this loan into 
account when  considering  Mr Ls complaints about the other loans.  
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 2 to 5 and 
loans 7 to 9. Mr L hasnt  provided any further  evidence or arguments for me to consider. So, 
I wont be making any further findings  on these  loans.   
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 6 and 10 would most likely 
have shown that Mr L had other outstanding short-term  loans at the same time as loan 6. 
This loan was taken  out only two days after loan 5 and just over a week after loan 4. Loans 4 
and 5 were still outstanding  at the time Mr L took out loan 6 and he also had a short-term 
loan with another company at this time as well. Mr L had been indebted to Sunny for several  
months at this point,  so I think Sunny ought  to have realised  that Mr L was having problems 
managing his money. 
For loan 10, Mr L took out this loan less than three  weeks after he had taken out loan 9. And 
he already had three loans with Sunny which were running concurrently. This pattern ought 
to have indicated  to Sunny that Mr L was having  to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  
Ref: DRN50137393his previous loans  was leaving in his finances and that his financial obligation to Sunny was 
increasing unsustainably. This was later shown  as Mr L fell into arrears  on the last three 
loans.
Overall, I think Sunny  ought to have realised that it was unlikely that Mr L wouldve been 
able to sustainably  repay this loan.  
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 and 10 and Sunny  should put things  
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
It isnt clear from the information  Sunny  has given  us as to whether the outstanding balances  
due on loans 7 to 10 have been  transferred  to a third party.  If they have, then Sunny should 
buy the loans  back if it can. If Sunny cant buy them back, then it needs to work with the third 
party to make sure the following is achieved: 
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 1, 6 and 10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
rework loan 10 applying all payments made  by Mr L as if they went towards the 
principal amount borrowed. But importantly,  Sunny needs  to make  sure that it 
collects no more than the principal sum lent. 
If the amount  Mr L has paid exceeds  the amount  he was lent, any further amounts 
paid should be treated  as overpayments. Any overpayments that may have been 
made should be refunded to Mr L with 8% simple  interest from the date the 
overpayment was made to the date of settlement ;
If after reworking loan 10 Mr L still has an outstanding principal sum, then Sunny can 
use the refund from loans 1 and 6 to offset this balance. If there  is any refund left 
over then this should be paid directly  to Mr L. 
                                                                                                                                     
remove any adverse information  about  loans 1, 6 and 10 from Mr Ls credit file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr L a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
If after doing the above Mr L still has an outstanding balance due on loan 10 then it should 
try and work  together  to come to a mutually  agreeable  repayment  plan in order to repay what  
is owed. But Id remind Sunny of its obligation  to treat Mr L fairly.  
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 February  2020.
