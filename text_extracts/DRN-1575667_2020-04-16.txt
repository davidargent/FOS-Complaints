The complaint
Ms B says Canada Square Operations Limited, trading as Egg, mis-sold her a payment 
protection insurance (PPI) policy.
What happened
Ms B applied for a credit card with Egg in 2001. At the same time, PPI was added to the 
credit card, providing her with cover in the event of disability and unemployment. It also 
included cover for death and serious illness.
Our adjudicator didnt think the complaint should be upheld. Ms B disagreed, so the 
complaint was passed to me to review afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about the sale of PPI on our website. And Ive taken this into account in deciding 
Ms Bs case.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. Ill explain why.
Before adding the PPI, Egg had to make it clear to Ms B that it was optional and get her 
agreement for it to do so. She says it didnt do that and that, in fact, she didnt know it had 
been added. 
Im satisfied Ms B applied for the credit card online. So, Ive looked at the screens I believe 
shed have seen and completed during the application process. These included a section on 
PPI. The section included a section to click on if she wanted PPI, and an equally prominent 
one to click on, just below it, if she didnt. Eggs internal records of the application details she 
provided indicate she chose to have PPI. 
So, I think Egg made it clear that it was selling optional PPI and that Ms B agreed to have it, 
knowing she had a choice. But, given the sale was back in 2001, its understandable if she 
doesnt remember that now.
I dont think Egg recommended the PPI to Ms B. This means Egg didnt have to look into 
whether it was right for her. But it should have provided enough information about the PPI for 
Ms B to make up her own mind as to whether it was right for her.
From what Ive seen, I dont think Egg made all the information Ms B needed clear to her. 
But, having gone on to consider what difference that might have made to Ms B, I dont think 
better information would have stopped her from buying the PPI. Thats because:Based on what I know of Ms Bs circumstances at the time, she was eligible for the 
PPI. And while the PPI had certain exclusions to, or limits on, the cover I cant see 
that she was significantly affected by them. 
Ms B doesnt recall if she was entitled to enhanced sick pay from her employer. But 
she says she could have relied on help from friends and family. The PPI benefits 
would have paid out for up to 12 months per claim. They covered her for 
unemployment too. And the benefits were guaranteed, unlike help from others who 
might not have been able to do so when it was needed. Overall, I think Ms B would 
have valued the security the PPI provided.
Theres nothing to suggest shed have considered the monthly premium to be 
unaffordable. And the PPI was flexible in that Ms B could have cancelled it at any 
time, and at no extra cost, if she no longer wanted it.
 
Taking everything into account, I dont believe Ms Bs lost out because of how Egg sold her 
the PPI. 
My final decision
For the reasons given, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 May 2020.
