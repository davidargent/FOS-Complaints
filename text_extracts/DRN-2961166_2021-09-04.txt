The complaint
Mr H complained that NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles lent him money that he couldnt afford 
to repay. He wanted NewDay to refund all his payments, with 8% interest, and clear his 
credit file.
What happened
Mr H complained to NewDay that the lending it made to him was unaffordable. He said it 
would have realised this if it had checked properly before giving him a card. Mr H said 
NewDay shouldve seen from his credit record that he had recently missed payments, he 
had defaults, and was in a debt management programme or IVA. Mr H said NewDay didnt 
ask him for proof of his income or expenses and it didnt ask about his expenses in detail.
Mr H said he couldnt pay the money back, and his debts had affected his mental health. 
When NewDay didnt uphold his complaint, he asked us to look into this for him.
NewDay told us it had opened a credit card for Mr H on 6 January 2017. It said that when he 
applied, he told it he was employed, earning £58,400 a year, and had additional household 
income of £500. He had unsecured debts totalling £16,400, and was living with his partner. 
NewDay said its external checks showed that Mr H had no defaults, no county court 
judgments, no payday loans and no accounts in arrears. It said he had a settled payment 
arrangement, but he wasnt involved in any debt management programs at that time. 
NewDay lent him £300, which it said wasnt a mistake. NewDay said Mr H had asked a 
couple of times for this limit to be increased in 2020, but it had refused. 
NewDay said it set up a reduced payment plan on Mr Hs account when he told it about his 
financial difficulties. And it had then asked a third-party debt collection agency to collect this 
money on its behalf. 
NewDay wouldnt refund Mr Hs money, or amend his credit file. 
Our investigator didnt uphold this complaint. She set out for Mr H what our service expected 
NewDay to do, when it lent him money. And she said that she thought that NewDay had 
carried out proportionate checks in this case. She said the checks NewDay had done, didnt 
show anything of concern, and NewDay reasonably considered this lending was affordable 
for Mr H. So our investigator didnt think NewDay had to do any more now.
Mr H didnt agree. He wanted his case to be considered by an ombudsman, so it was 
passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall view on this complaint as our investigator.
I can see from the data that NewDay has shared with us, that Mr Hs overall indebtedness 
has significantly increased in the years since this lending was made. Hes told us that hes 
found this very difficult, and its affected his mental health. Im sorry to hear that, and I hope 
hes now starting to feel better. 
I understand that the credit card lending which NewDay made to Mr H will have played a part 
in the difficulties he has experienced. But what I need to think about is the lending decision 
that NewDay originally made, in January 2017, and whether Mr Hs subsequent difficulties 
were foreseeable then.
When Mr H first complained to NewDay, he said that he was in a very poor financial position 
when he made this application. But I think its important to note that what the credit reference 
agencies told NewDay when Mr H took out this card doesnt seem to me to match what he 
said to NewDay when he complained. 
I havent been able to see any evidence that Mr H had defaults, arrears, an active debt 
management program or an IVA when he made this application in 2017. Although he did 
already have debts, he appeared to be managing those well, because the credit reference 
agency that NewDay checked with, said he hadnt missed any payments. And he had 
declared a relatively high household income. I dont think that NewDay had any reason to 
believe that Mr H hadnt told the truth about that. 
I note that NewDay only lent Mr H £300 initially, and this amount was never increased. So I 
dont agree that NewDay needed, in this case, to seek further information from Mr H about 
his income and expenditure before it opened this account for him. I dont think it was 
irresponsible when it lent him this money, in early 2017.
I know that Mr H will be disappointed, but I dont think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 October 2021.
