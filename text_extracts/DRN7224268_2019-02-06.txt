K820x#14complaint
Mr Bs complaint is that Crownhouse IFAS  Ltd (Crownhouse) gave him unsuitable advice to 
invest in three unregulated patent investment/tax mitigation  schemes. This decision is about  
his investments, on a leveraged basis, in the Lorem Technologies (Lorem) patent scheme 
(Lorem) in March 2012 and in the Umbra  Products  (Umbra) patent scheme in June  2012.  
The complaint about the first (of the three) patent scheme investments he made, in January  
2012, is being addressed  separately.  Mr B is represented in his complaint.
background
In the main,  Mr B and his representative  say:
Crownhouse advised  him to invest in both the Lorem  and Umbra  schemes.  It assured 
him that the application  for the relevant patents  would  be successful and the patents 
would be valuable  thereafter but, in the alternative, if the scheme was unsuccessful  
the resulting loss could be written off against  his tax liability.  He has lost the capital 
he invested and HMRC will not allow the loss to be written  off against his tax liability.
Before the three patent scheme  investments his experience was limited to buy-to-let 
properties, an Individual Savings  Account (ISA), pensions and investment in a 
government backed Business Property  Renovation Allowance (BPRA)  Scheme. He 
did not have experience  of unregulated investments  and his BPRA  related 
experience involved  an industry sector that he was/is professionally familiar with. He 
says the patent  scheme investments were unsuitable because  such  investments 
were beyond  his appetite  for risk and beyond his experience and expertise. He also 
says Crownhouses advice was given  without an assessment  of his personal  
circumstances at the time.
In support of the complaint, his representative also alleges that Crownhouse 
breached the Conduct of Business Sourcebook (COBS) rules in the regulators 
Handbook, in terms of COBS 9.2.1(R),  COBS 9.2.2(R)  and COBS  9.4.1(R)   the first 
two rules relate to its alleged failure to assess suitability of the investments for Mr B 
and the third relates to its alleged failure to provide a suitability report.
Crownhouse says:
It did not promote  itself or the investments to Mr B. He approached Crownhouse in 
2011 for assistance in investing  an employment related lump  sum into a tax 
mitigation scheme. It first met with him in December 2011. Thereafter, and on his 
behalf, it looked into the market  for a scheme(s) that matched his circumstances. It 
advised/recommended some  regulated  options to Mr B. It also identified unregulated 
options but, in this respect, it told Mr B that it could neither  give advice on their 
prospects for success nor could it give tax advice in relation to them  and that it could 
only discharge the role of an introducer, to the relevant scheme operator, in this 
respect. Mr B preferred the unregulated options  and it introduced  him to the operator  
of the first patent scheme he invested  in  who was the same operator  of the Lorem  
and Umbra schemes. It believes the scheme operator advised  Mr B.
The tax mitigation objective  was important to Mr B. The patent in the first scheme 
was granted. That meant no loss arose from it, so he initiated the investment in 
Lorem in the hope that an unsuccessful patent application within  it would produce a 
loss which, in a leveraged  context, could be written off against his tax liability. 
Crownhouse identified Lorem for him. The patent  application in Lorem was also 
successful so Mr B initiated  the investment in Umbra  for the same reason. The patent 
Ref: DRN72242682application in Umbra  was unsuccessful so, as far as Crownhouse was aware at the 
time, Mr B proceeded to claim  the relevant tax relief. In 2013 it learnt that he had a 
problem in this respect  but he did not make  contact thereafter until his 
representatives complaint(s) in 2016.
It suggests that the complaint was not made in time.
One of our investigators  looked into the complaints  about Mr Bs investments in all three 
schemes. She did not consider  that they should  be upheld and the reasons she gave for all 
three investments are broadly similar. In the main,  she said that the complaints were  in time 
 within  six years of the dates of investments  but she was not persuaded that Crownhouse 
recommended the investments to Mr B. Mr B and his representative  rejected  this outcome, 
re-presented and elaborated upon  their points and asked for an ombudsmans decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  As I said above,  this decision is about the 
Lorem and Umbra investments. 
Time Limit
The regulators rules say that we cannot  consider  a complaint referred more than six years  
after the event  or (if later) more than three years after the complainant knew or ought  
reasonably to have  known  there was cause  to complain  unless the complainant has a 
written (or some other) record  that shows a complaint  was made  in time. A late complaint 
can be considered  where  exceptional circumstances have caused the delay. Both 
investments (events) took place  in 2012. The complaint  to Crownhouse  was made in 2016 
and was referred to us in the same  year  both within six years  of 2012.
Advice
Crownhouse appears to accept that it gave  Mr B advice on regulated tax mitigation 
schemes. It says he declined to invest in them.  It disputes that it recommended  his 
investments in the three unregulated patent  schemes  including Lorem  and Umbra.  There  
is sufficient evidence to conclude that, at the very least, Crownhouse  was engaged in the 
regulated activity of arranging  deals  in investment for Mr Bs investments in Lorem  and 
Umbra. Arranging deals in investments is defined as  making  arrangements for another 
person (whether as principal or agent) to buy, sell, subscribe for or underwrite a particular 
investment  This conclusion arises from the extent to which  Crownhouse was involved,  as 
it concedes, in searching the market for the schemes, in identifying  the schemes, in reporting 
back to Mr B and in introducing Mr B to the operator  of the schemes. It is (or should  be) 
arguably beyond  dispute that it arranged the investments for Mr B.
In order for Mr Bs complaint, as it has been presented, to succeed he needs to show more 
than Crownhouses role in arranging the investments.  The complaint needs persuasive  
evidence that an express  recommendation  of the Lorem and Umbra investments was given 
to him by Crownhouse. The regulatory  rules  (about  suitability)  cited by his representative 
apply if there  was advice  from Crownhouse. Investment advice  (advising on investments) is 
defined as:
[advice] given to the person in his capacity as an investor or potential  investor   on the 
merits of his doing any of the following (whether as principal or agent)  
Ref: DRN72242683buying selling,  subscribing for or underwriting  a particular investment  which  is a security  or a 
[relevant investment], or
exercising any right conferred by such an investment  to buy, sell, subscribe for or underwrite 
such an investment.
I am satisfied that Crownhouse was engaged in advising Mr B on the investment of his lump  
sum for a tax mitigation  purpose.  It accepts that it recommended  regulated  investments in 
this respect and there is evidence in the form of its letter of February 2012  albeit after the 
first investment in January  2011   referring  to such investments. However,  this does not 
automatically mean that it recommended  the unregulated patent investments  or the 
investments in Lorem and Umbra.  The core issues are whether (or not) it went  as far as to 
recommend unregulated investments, as Mr B alleges, or as far as to recommend Lorem  
and Umbra specifically, as is also alleged in the complaint.
The letter of February 2012 appears  to be the main  available piece of evidence  from around 
the time of the investments. It includes reference  to the unregulated  patent scheme 
investment option  for the tax mitigation purpose. There does not appear  to be evidence,  from 
the relevant time, showing that Mr B objected to the letter or to its contents. The letter 
expressly says that Crownhouse was unable  to give advice on the prospects of a patent 
scheme as an investment  or in the context of tax planning, and that the scheme  operator  
was responsible for such advice. There appears  to be no evidence that Mr B disputed this at 
the time.  Given that the first investment  had already taken  place in the previous month,  it is 
reasonable to expect  that he would have commented on this statement if it misrepresented  
the source of any advice  he received  for that investment. After the letter,  Mr B returned to 
Crownhouse to make the Lorem and Umbra investments and he does not appear to have 
questioned its disclaimer with regards to advice.  The overall  implication, on balance, is that 
Crownhouse did not give advice on the investments  as the letter says.
Mr Bs representative recently  provided  this service  with an email from the scheme operator, 
which was also drafted recently, in which it says it was not responsible  for advice on the 
patent scheme investment(s).  This suggests that reference in Crownhouses letter to the 
scheme operators responsibility for such advice might have been inaccurate. If this is so, it 
is arguably also possible that Crownhouse did not know that the scheme operator might  not 
give such advice, when  it made the statement  in the letter. Primarily, I consider that the point  
noted above applies. If Mr B had not received  advice from the scheme operator leading to 
the first patent scheme investment in January, it is reasonable to expect that he would have 
raised this and corrected  the February  letter in this respect before or in the course  of the 
investments in March  and June 2012. I have  not seen evidence  that he did.
Overall and on balance,  there is not enough  evidence to conclude  that Crownhouse advised 
Mr B to make the Lorem and Umbra  investments. Available evidence  is that it expressly 
disclaimed responsibility  for such advice  and that Mr B does not appear to have disputed  
that disclaimer at the time  which suggests  that the disclaimer  was/is accurate.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I do not uphold Mr Bs complaint. Under the rules of the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or reject  my decision 
before 6 March  2019.
