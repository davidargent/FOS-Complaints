K822xcomplaint
Mrs S complains that Aviva  Insurance Limited is responsible for poor service  in connection 
with a home emergency insurance policy.
background 
Mrs S had a policy in the name of a home  assistance company. Aviva  was responsible  for 
dealing with claims. Where I refer to Aviva I include the home assistance company, 
engineers and others for whose  actions  I hold Aviva responsible.
In October  2018 Mrs S called for help from the insurer.  At first she had a problem with a 
thermostat. Later her boiler  leaked water. She took a day off work on 19 October 2018 for an 
appointment  which the insurer didnt keep. Later that day the insurer turned the boiler off. 
Mrs S was left without central heating and hot water until about 30 October. It took until 
about 10 November  to replace the thermostat.
Mrs S complained about delay and mishandling. In a final response  letter,  the insurer  offered 
Mrs S £76.08 compensation for lost wages and £200.00  for the trouble  and upset caused.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld. He didnt  think  the offer 
went far enough to reflect  the problems Mrs S experienced. The adjudicator recommended  
that Aviva  should - in addition to reimbursing  £76.08  for lost wages due to the cancelled  
appointment - pay Mrs S a total of £300.00  for the trouble and upset that was caused. 
Aviva agreed with the adjudicators opinion.
Mrs S disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. She asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. She says,  in summary,  that £500.00 would be fair for her distress  and 
inconvenience.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The policy terms said that  if the insurer was unable to attend within the same day as the 
call for help or the following  working day  it would  provide temporary  electrical heaters.
On 9 October 2018 Mrs S called for help with the thermostat. On 10 October 2018 the 
insurer visited Mrs S. it said it would order  a new thermostat  and  when it arrived  make 
another appointment to fit it. 
Mrs S called for an update on 17 October  2018. The insurer said it had booked  an 
appointment for 19 October 2018.  So Mrs S asked at short notice for a day off work so she 
could be at home for the engineer.
On 18 October 2018 Mrs S reported a boiler leak. The insurer  said it would fit the new 
thermostat and repair the leak the following day. 
Mrs S missed work  on 19 October 2018.  Aviva  accepts  that she lost £76.08 in wages. But 
the insurer cancelled  the appointment late in the afternoon of 19 October 2018. Mrs S called 
Ref: DRN80099982the insurer again that evening about the boiler  leak. She was clearly in distress. The insurer   
stopped the leak by isolating  the boiler. But that left Mrs S and her family  without  central 
heating and hot water.
On Saturday 20 October  2018 the insurer drained  down the boiler and ordered a new heat 
exchanger.
The insurer  and Mrs S made an appointment for Saturday 27 October 2018 between 8am 
and 1pm but it didnt  attend until around 3:30pm. And it didnt  have the right parts to repair 
the boiler. Mrs S expressed concern for the two young children in her house. The insurer  
made another appointment for 29 October  but re-arranged  it for 30 October 2018.
Mrs S asked for heaters. The insurer provided two heaters on 29 October  2018.  I think  it 
shouldve provided  them much sooner.
On 30 October 2018 the insurer repaired the heat exchanger.  After  twelve days, she again  
had heating and hot water. But the insurer didnt  fix the thermostat.
The insurer  made an appointment  and visited on Saturday 10 November 2018. The insurer  
at first said it couldnt replace the thermostat   but then did replace it the same day.
Overall, I find that were too many appointments and delays, mostly caused by incorrect  
spare parts. There was also poor communication and a delay in providing  heaters.
The insurer  has offered  to compensate Mrs S £76.08 for her loss of income on 19 October 
2018. And Mrs S hasnt  disagreed with that figure. But I dont  think the insurer  has paid it. 
Mrs S has been out of pocket for about a year. So I find it fair to direct  it to pay interest  at our 
usual rate.
The insurer  also caused Mrs S distress and inconvenience including  concern for the children  
especially during  the October  break  when  they were  off school  and the house had no 
heating.
I dont think the offer of £200.00 was enough to compensate fairly for this distress and 
inconvenience. Like the adjudicator, I find £300.00  fair and reasonable.
Ref: DRN80099983my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I direct Aviva  
Insurance Limited to pay Mrs S (insofar as it hasnt already paid her):
1.£76.08 for her loss of income on 19 October  2018; and
2.simple interest on £76.08 at a yearly rate of 8% from 19 October 2018 to the date of 
payment. If Aviva  considers that its required by HM Revenue  & Customs to withhold 
income tax from that interest, it must tell Mrs S how much its taken off. It should also 
give her a tax deduction certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim  the tax 
from HM Revenue  & Customs  if appropriate;  and
3.£300.00 for distress  and inconvenience.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 November 2019.
