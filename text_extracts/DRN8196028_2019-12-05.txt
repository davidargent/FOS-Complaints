K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs S complain  that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt offer them  the interest rate 
it had advertised when they switched mortgage products. 
background
Mr and Mrs S had a mortgage with NatWest. Their mortgage product was due to expire in 
October 2018. Mrs S contacted NatWest  about taking out a new mortgage  product. She 
wanted a product shed seen on a comparison site. NatWest said this product wasnt  
available to Mr and Mrs S. It said the product was only available  for mortgages over 
£500,000. Mr and Mrs S took out a different mortgage product, with a higher  interest  rate. 
In November 2018 Mrs S contacted NatWest again.  She says she was told during this call 
that there  was a note saying they were eligible to borrow more under their mortgage. Mrs S 
says NatWest should have told her this before. Shed have borrowed another £12-15,000 to 
take their mortgage  over £500,000 and qualify for the better  interest rate product.
Our investigator didnt  recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She said NatWest  
hadnt treated  Mr and Mrs S unfairly.  They didnt meet  the criteria for the mortgage product 
they wanted. When Mrs S contacted NatWest about  taking out a new mortgage product she 
hadnt said she wanted to borrow more. The investigator said she wouldnt expect NatWest to 
suggest Mr and Mrs S take out extra borrowing. And the note on Mr and Mrs Ss account was 
only an internal  note that they might be eligible for more borrowing. It wasnt  an offer to lend, 
which would only be considered after receiving information about their financial position.
Mr and Mrs S didnt  agree. Mrs S said NatWest didnt give them the opportunity  to cancel the 
mortgage product  and apply for the better product  after taking out additional borrowing. She said 
as a premier customer she should  have received better service. Mrs S said the rates published 
online dont  say they are only for mortgage  over £500,000. And shed been  asking NatWest for an 
overdraft facility and it could have told her then that she could have borrowed under her mortgage. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or 
contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities   in other words, what  I consider 
is most  likely  to have happened in light of the available evidence  and the wider  circumstances. 
I understand that Mr and Mrs S were disappointed  that the mortgage product they wanted 
wasnt available to them. But I dont think NatWest  treated them unfairly.  They didnt meet  the 
criteria for the product.  I dont know if the product  summary Mrs S saw on a comparison site set 
out all the required  criteria, either  on the summary page or by opening an option  for more 
information. But NatWest  told her as soon as she contacted it that the product wasnt available. 
I dont think its reasonable to say that NatWest  should have suggested Mr and Mrs S apply 
for additional borrowing so that they would qualify  for a different mortgage  product. Theres 
nothing to suggest that Mr and Mrs S applied for additional borrowing  or told NatWest  they 
intended to do so before taking out a new mortgage product. 
NatWest told Mrs S that the mortgage  product she wanted was only available for mortgages 
over £500,000. If Mrs S had wanted  to borrow another £15,000, which  would have taken her 
mortgage over £500,000,  she could have raised this at the time. 
Ref: DRN81960282NatWest says theres no note on Mr and Mrs Ss account that theyre  eligible for additional  
borrowing: it says there  might have been  a pop up message during one of the phone  calls. 
So this prompt might not have appeared before Mr and Mrs S took out the new mortgage  
product. But, in any case, I dont think it changes the outcome here. Mr and Mrs S didnt tell 
NatWest they wanted to apply for additional  borrowing before they took out a new product. 
And I dont  think it was for NatWest to suggest  they do so.
I also dont think it makes  a difference that Mr and Mrs S discussed their overdraft limit with 
NatWest. Different regulations apply to mortgage lending,  and the process is different when a 
customer applies for mortgage lending, as compared to an overdraft. The available evidence 
suggests the discussion was about  whether  Mr and Mrs Ss overdraft limit should be increased 
to £5,000. I dont  think  its reasonable  to say that this should have prompted  NatWest to 
suggest Mr and Mrs S take out £15,000 additional  borrowing under their mortgage. 
I dont think its fair and reasonable, in the circumstances,  to require NatWest to allow Mr and 
Mrs S to cancel the product they took out (without paying any early repayment charge) or 
require it to offer a different  product  to Mr and Mrs S to replace the product they agreed to. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision  before  5 January  2020.
