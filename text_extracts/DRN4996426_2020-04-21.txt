K821x#15Complaint
Mr B complains Elevate  Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him 
irresponsibly.
Background
Mr B took one running credit facility (RCF) and then 28 instalment loans. Ive included  some 
of the information weve  received from Sunny about  these loans in the appendix at the end 
of this decision.
The RCF is different to the instalment loans. The RCF allowed Mr B to either request funds 
up to his agreed credit limit in one go or take multiple drawdowns up to that limit. I 
understand Mr B initially had a credit limit of £200  and that this increased  to £400 whilst the 
facility was being used. Each drawdown could  be repaid via five monthly instalments. 
Our adjudicator assessed Mr Bs complaint and thought  it was wrong for Sunny to have 
granted loans  6 to 29. 
It appears Mr B has accepted what our adjudicator said. Sunny disagreed. But, Sunny has 
already accepted that something  may have gone wrong when it provided loans 12 to 29, so 
it agreed to refund interest on these  loans together with 8% simple interest. It also agreed  to 
amend Mr Bs credit file by removing any relevant entries to reflect  its offer. Mr B hasnt 
accepted the offer.  
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed  to me for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr B doesnt  appear to disagree with our adjudicators findings that Sunny hadnt  made  an 
error when  it provided the RCF and loans  2 to 5. It seems therefore that these loans arent in 
dispute and so I no longer think that I need  to make a finding about them. However,  I have 
kept these loans in mind  when thinking  about  the overall lending  relationship  between  Mr B 
and Sunny. 
Ive also not considered whether Sunny should  have lent loans 12 to 29 as it has already 
agreed it shouldnt.  But for clarity Ive set out how Sunny should update Mr Bs credit  file for 
these loans.    
So instead,  this decision will focus on whether Sunny  did anything wrong when it granted 
loans 6 to 11. But I have kept the other lending in mind when thinking about the overall 
lending relationship between Sunny and Mr B. 
Ref: DRN49964262For the lending  that remains in dispute, Sunny had to assess  it to check if Mr B could  afford 
to pay back the amounts  hed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way 
which was proportionate to the circumstances. Sunnys checks could have  taken into 
account a number of different things, such as how much  was being lent, the size of the 
repayments and Mr Bs income  and expenditure. With this in mind,  I think in the early  stages  
of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have  been  proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr B. These  factors include:
Mr B having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet  a higher repayment from a particular  level of income);  
Mr B having a large  number  of loans and/or having these loans over a long 
period of time (reflecting  the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr B coming back for loans shortly  after previous borrowing had been repaid  
(also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr B.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr B could sustainably repay his instalment loans  
not just whether he technically had enough  money to make  his repayments. Having enough 
money to make the repayments could of course  be an indicator that Mr B was able to repay  
his loans sustainably.  But it doesnt  automatically  follow that this is the case. The Financial 
Conduct Authority  (the industry regulatory) says in the Consumer Credit Sourcebook 
(CONC) states payments are sustainable if they are made without undue difficulties and in 
particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable  commitments and without having 
to borrow to make them.  If a lender realises,  or ought reasonably  to have realised, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it follows  
that it should conclude those repayments  are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Bs complaint.
Having looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr B, I agree with our 
adjudicator that Sunny  should  reasonably  have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  
or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided  loan 6. 
I say this because:
By loan 6 it was eleven months into the lending relationship. And whilst there had 
been a break of around two months between the ending  of the RCF and loan 2, a 
further four loans  followed in quite quick succession  over a period of a few weeks.  In 
my view,  Mr Bs loan history  up until this point was a clear  indication that his 
underlying financial  situation didnt seem  to be improving; 
Ref: DRN49964263Mr B took loan 4 shortly after repayment of loans  2 and 3, with loans 5 and 6 
following within a period of two weeks.  
So Sunny ought to have  realised that Mr B may have  been borrowing further to cover 
a hole the repayment of previous loans had left in his finances and that this was 
indicative of his indebtedness not being sustainable;
Mr Bs indebtedness under the RCF was around  the credit limit of £200 initially  
before increasing  to £400 after three months - and then remained  at this level 
following two further drawdowns. A broadly similar  pattern  followed with two 
instalment loans of £200, followed by three further loans  totalling  £350 taken out 
within two weeks of each  other. I think its most likely this consistent pattern of 
borrowing over the period showed  that Mr B didnt just have a short-term cash-flow 
problem but was probably supporting  regular living expenses  or other financial 
commitments; 
Mr Bs lending  history was prolonged with loans  being taken out throughout most of 
2015 followed by periods of successive lending in 2016 and 2017. Many  of the loans 
overlapped and were  often taken out and repaid in batches. The amount of time that 
Mr B spent  indebted  to Sunny meant that he was servicing a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr B lost out when Sunny provided  loans  6 to 29:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period and;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Bs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Bs complaint about  his borrowing from loan 6 to loan 29. And Ive set 
out what Sunny should do to put things right as detailed below.
Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 6 to 29;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;  
Ref: DRN49964264remove loans 6 to 29 from Mr Bs credit file entirely, this is because  the period of time 
Mr B owed  Sunny money means that any information still recorded about these loans 
is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny  must give Mr B a certificate showing  how 
much tax it has taken  off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Bs complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr B as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 May 2020.
