The complaint
The estate of Mr H (The Estate) complains that OakNorth Bank plc wont release the
proceeds of an account belonging to the late Mr H to an executor account nominated by The
Estate.
What happened
The history of this complaint is well known and understood by both The Estate and
OakNorth, and so I will not restate it in detail here.
In short, Mr N is unhappy that OakNorth arent willing to release monies belonging to The
Estate to an executor account which OakNorth havent been able to successfully verify by
the methods outlined in its relevant operational process. Mr N feels that OakNorth should
take steps to verify the account by means outside its operational process, which OakNorth
are unwilling to do. Conversely, OakNorth have provided alternative solutions to Mr N which
he is unwilling to accept.
This matter was first raised as a complaint by The Estate with OakNorth, who didnt uphold
the complaint. The Estate then referred its complaint to this service where it was considered
by one of our investigators. After a lengthy consultation and investigation process, our
investigator felt that one of the OakNorths proposed solutions  that the monies be
transferred to a personal account of Mr N, whereby it could be transferred on to the
nominated executor account by Mr N himself  was reasonable.
The Estate didnt accept the proposal put forwards by OakNorth, and OakNorth continued to
require the executor account to be verified in line with its process before being willing to
transfer the proceeds of the account directly to it. So, the matter was escalated to an
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 18 August 2022 as follows:
It seems clear to me that both The Estate and OakNorth have taken very similar 
positions here  in that both parties are insisting that a certain process must be
followed that is unacceptable to the other party.
I say this because Mr N is insisting that the money belonging to The Estate be 
transferred by OakNorth to the nominated executor account directly, and that 
OakNorth should take steps outside of its operational process to enable that account 
to be successfully verified. While on the other hand, OakNorth is insisting that the 
nominated executor account must be verified by methods acceptable to its process  
which it has so far been unable to do  although it is willing to transfer the money to 
an account in Mr Ns own name, which OakNorth has been able to successfully 
verify, in order to resolve the situation.
Given the seemingly intractable positions taken by both The Estate and OakNorth, I 
find it very difficult to conclude that either party should be considered as being less or 
more accountable than the other party for the current impasse here.
Ultimately though, it isnt within the remit of this service to instruct a business to 
change its operational policies. This is because this service isnt a regulatory body. 
What this service can consider is whether an unfair outcome has occurred because 
of the application of an operational policy, given the full circumstances of a complaint.
But I dont think an unfair outcome has arisen here, and this is because Im satisfied 
that OakNorth have demonstrated a willingness to work with The Estate to find a 
resolution to the current impasse.
For instance, OakNorth have suggested that The Estate asks the executor account 
provider to resubmit a verification payment with amended payee account information 
that would then enable OakNorth to successfully verify that account. Alternatively, 
OakNorth have also suggested that The Estate open another executor account with 
an alternative provider and then make a verification payment from that new account.
After liaising with OakNorth about these suggestions theyve confirmed that The 
Estates current executor account provider has submitted amended payee 
information in a similar situation previously, and that OakNorth would be able to 
provide The Estate, upon request, details of which executor account providers 
theyve historically successfully verified.
These suggestions seem reasonable to me. And while I appreciate that The Estate 
may not want to undertake the actions required by the suggestions, I feel that its 
incumbent on The Estate to work within the parameters set by OakNorth here, rather 
than the other way round. 
Finally, as explained above, another potential solution is that OakNorth would pay the 
money into a personal bank account in Mr Ns name, and that Mr N could then 
transfer the money to the existing executor account.
This also seems like a reasonable solution to me, although as with any transactions 
into a personal bank account, there may be a tax consequence for Mr N. I would 
therefore encourage Mr N to seek relevant financial advice (which it isnt within the 
remit of this service to provide) before potentially accepting that proposal.
All of which means that I find it difficult to conclude that OakNorth have acted unfairly 
or unreasonably towards The Estate here, and it follows from this that my provisional 
decision is that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing OakNorth to take 
any further action here, beyond that to which theyve already agreed.
In response to my provisional decision, Mr N provided a detailed response outlining why he 
disagreed with my provisional decision. Id like to that Mr N for submitting this response, 
which Ive read and considered in full. However, I wont be responding in similar detail here. 
Instead, Ill focus on what I feel are the key points of Mr Ns counter argument, in line with 
this services role as an informal dispute resolution service. 
As such, if Mr N notes I havent responded to a specific point he made in his response to my 
provisional decision, it shouldnt be taken that I havent read and considered that point. Instead, it should be taken that I have read and considered that point, but that I dont feel it 
necessary to address that point directly in this letter to arrive at a fair outcome here.
Mr N feels that my provisional decision states that he should allow OakNorth to send the 
funds belonging to The Estate to his personal account. However, I would refer Mr N to my 
provisional decision above, which outlines that my position is somewhat broader than Mr N 
explains and is that I feel that OakNorth have suggested a number of reasonable solutions to 
the current impasse. These include Mr N asking the executor account provider to resubmit a 
verification payment with amended payee account information that would then enable 
OakNorth to successfully verify that account, and that The Estate opens another executor 
account with an alternative provider and make a verification payment from that new account.
So, while I do also state that I feel that the option for Mr N to receive the funds into his 
personal account and forward it the executor account is a reasonable one, I dont deem it to 
be the only potential way forward. Furthermore, I also specifically state in my provisional 
decision that taking this route may involve personal tax implications for Mr N and that Mr N 
may want to seek relevant financial advice before potentially accepting that proposal.
Mr N also states that my position that I feel its incumbent on him in this situation to work 
within the parameters set by OakNorth rather than the other way round, is tantamount to me 
saying that financial institutions always have the right of this particular argument, regardless 
of whether their parameters are reasonable or not. 
However, I would refer Mr N to my provisional decision letter again, which I feel makes clear 
that Ive considered OakNorths requirements, as well as their suggestions on how the 
matter can be resolved, and that having done so I feel that OakNorths position is fair and 
reasonable. And that as such, I feel its incumbent on Mr N to work within these fair and 
reasonable parameters set by OakNorth to achieve his objective here. In short, I considered 
the fairness of OakNorths position before stating that I felt it was incumbent on Mr N to work 
with OakNorth, and it wasnt the case that I sided with OakNorth on this matter by default.
Mr N then provides an analysis of OakNorths account verification processes with Mr N then 
ultimately suggesting that OakNorth do have the facility to verify the executor account via the 
means that Mr N has already attempted but for some reason are declining to do so. I dont 
feel this is the case, and I feel that if OakNorth were able to successfully verify the executor 
account in line with their own requirements, and therefore put this matter to an end, that they 
would have done so. In short, I feel that OakNorths position that they cant verify the 
executor account to their own satisfaction at present isnt misleading.
Finally, Mr N makes a multi-faceted argument as to why my not upholding this complaint in 
his favour would necessarily involve my finding various points which Mr N feels are logically 
counterintuitive as being established facts. However, I reject the logic implied by Mr N here, 
and refer him once again to my provisional decision letter which I remain satisfied does 
provide a clear explanation of my position, and is a fair and reasonable resolution to whats 
happened here.
For instance, Mr Ns argument includes that my not upholding this complaint in his favour 
implies an acceptance of the point that an executor shouldnt be entitled to expect a financial 
institution to have processes and systems in place to meet the needs of an executor. 
But this clearly isnt the case, because OakNorth do have such processes in place. 
Unfortunately, in this specific instance, these systems and processes havent led to 
OakNorth being able to successfully verify the executor account, such that further action 
from Mr N is required. Accordingly, I feel that Mr Ns point here doesnt have merit, and I 
hold a similar position in regard to the further points of Mr Ns argument also.Ultimately, in consideration of all the information and evidence available to me here, it 
remains my position that OakNorth have presented Mr N with reasonable solutions as to 
how this matter may be progressed and that it is fairly incumbent on Mr N, if he wants the 
funds belonging to The Estate to be transferred directly to an executor account, to work with 
OakNorth to enable the verification of an executor account by OakNorth to their satisfaction. 
   
All of which means I see no reason not to issue a final decision here on the same basis as 
outlined in my provisional decision above, and I can confirm that I do issue a final decision 
on that basis accordingly.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr H 
to accept or reject my decision before 21 October 2022.
