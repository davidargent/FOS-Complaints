K821x#15complaint
Mr H has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
MYJAR Limited. Mr H says he was lent to irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial 
problems.
background
We now know that Mr H took out 8 loans from MYJAR between  October  2015  and 
September 2017. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Hs borrowing with MYJAR,  based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan 5 onwards. Neither MYJAR, nor Mr H, agrees with this. MYJAR says 
that it didnt do anything wrong  and Mr H says he feels all the loans were irresponsible. The 
complaint has therefore come to me for an ombudsmans final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Hs 
complaint.
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr H could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought  to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
MYJAR should have  fairly and reasonably done  more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, MYJAR was required to establish 
Ref: DRN93925802whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr H could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
MYJAR told us it carried out certain affordability  and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr H. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending history to 
him with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  Ive considered  whether, at 
some point, MYJAR should  have realised that it shouldnt  have  provided  any further loans. 
Our adjudicator said that he thought the complaint about loans 1, 2, 3 and 4 ought  not to be 
upheld as they appeared affordable. Ive looked  carefully at these and taken  note of Mr Hs 
job and of the income declared by him at around  the time.  Ive also looked  at what  he said 
about his monthly  expenditure.  
With this information,  and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks which MYJAR  most  likely carried  out appear to have 
been proportionate for loans 1  4. And I think these  levels  of checks,  together  with the 
income and expenditure details provided  by Mr H, would  have  made those particular loans 
appear affordable  for him. 
However, I think the emerging and repeated lending pattern from the point of loan 5 onwards 
in this case would have looked  different and therefore required a more thorough and 
responsible approach. The overall  pattern of MYJARs lending  to Mr H should have caused it 
to see, in my view,  that it shouldnt have  provided any further loans from this point onwards. 
This is because this was his fifth short-term loan application with MYJAR in the previous 13 
months. And in common with his borrowing pattern thus far, he was again asking to borrow  
from MYJAR  relatively quickly after paying off his previous loan. So MYJAR  ought to have 
realised that Mr H was probably borrowing to meet  regular shortfalls  in his income and to 
meet an ongoing  need. He was having to consistently take out high interest, short-term 
lending and his indebtedness was becoming  unsustainable. MYJAR should have seen this 
and ought to have realised Mr H was at risk of not managing to repay his loans  sustainably.  
So Im upholding  this complaint in respect of loans 5, 6, 7 and 8. MYJAR  repeatedly  lent to 
Mr H in an unsustainable manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
Ref: DRN93925803the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 5, 6, 7 and 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5, 6, 7 and 8 should be completely 
removed from Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR  must  give Mr H a certificate  
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Hs complaint. MYJAR Limited should put things 
right for Mr H as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 February  2020.
