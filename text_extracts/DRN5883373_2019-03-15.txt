K820x#14complaint
Miss J says The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) mis-sold her a payment protection  
insurance (PPI)  policy.  
background
Miss J bought the policy in 2004  at the same time as taking out a credit  card.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Miss J disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Miss Js case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Miss Js complaint because:
 I think RBS made Miss J aware that she had a choice about  buying the PPI, and that 
she chose to take it by ticking a box on the credit card application form. 
 RBS didnt recommend the PPI to Miss J so it didnt have to check if it was right for her. 
 Its possible the information RBS gave Miss J about the PPI wasnt  as clear  as it 
shouldve been. But Miss J doesnt  appear  to have been affected by any of the main  
things the policy  didnt cover  and based on what I know about  her circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been  useful to her. She had some sick pay but the PPI 
wouldve paid out on top of this, so her sick pay could be used for other things. The 
PPI also provided  unemployment cover, and she wouldve had no other way to make 
repayments in those circumstances. So I dont think better  information wouldve 
stopped her buying it. 
Ive taken into account Miss Js comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Miss Js complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 April 2019.
