K820x#14complaint
Mr J complains about the amount that he owes to FirstRand Bank Limited, trading as 
MotoNovo Finance, after the car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase  agreement 
was repossessed and sold at auction.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus  on giving the reasons for 
my decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr J under  a hire purchase agreement  with MotoNovo 
Finance that he signed in September 2016   the car was about  seven  years  old, had 
been driven for 70,000 miles and had a price  of £4,350;
the car was seized  by the police  in November 2016 and was then collected from the 
police by a third party on behalf  of MotoNovo Finance  a notice  of default was sent 
to Mr J but he didnt  respond  to it so the hire purchase agreement  was terminated 
and the car was sold at auction  in February  2017  for £2,000;
the proceeds of sale were applied to Mr Js account which  reduced  the outstanding 
balance of his account to £2,524.08 and MotoNovo Finance has transferred  his debt 
to a debt collection  agency;
Mr J has complained about that amount  and the price that the car was sold for at 
auction and hes described the health and financial difficulties that hes experiencing;
he also says that it was irresponsible for MotoNovo Finance to have provided credit 
to him as it wasnt affordable for him  but that didnt form part of his original 
complaint to MotoNovo Finance or this service so Im unable to consider  those  issues  
as part of this complaint  if Mr J wants to complain  about  those issues he should 
complain to MotoNovo  Finance  and then,  if hes not satisfied  with its response,  he 
may be able to make a complaint  to this service;
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that MotoNovo Finance has 
acted incorrectly in the circumstances about  Mr J has complained   it took 
possession of the car after it had been  seized by the police, it sent a notice of default 
to Mr J but he didnt  respond  to it and it then terminated the agreement, arranged  for 
the car to be sold at auction and applied the sale proceeds to Mr Js account  I dont 
consider that it has acted unfairly or unreasonably;
MotoNovo Finance  has provided a receipt from the auctioneer  showing that the car 
sold for £2,000  and Im not persuaded  that theres any evidence to support  Mr Js 
claim that the car was undersold, mis-sold or that it had been damaged after it 
was seized by the police;  and
I sympathise with Mr J for the health and financial difficulties that hes experiencing 
but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require  MotoNovo  Finance to 
waive or reduce  the outstanding balance of his account  but its required to respond 
Ref: DRN24516722to the financial  difficulties that hes experiencing positively and sympathetically so I 
suggest that he contacts it to discuss those difficulties.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold Mr Js complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 January 2021.
