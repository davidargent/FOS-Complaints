*At times,  Mr S had more than one loan outstanding, this is the total amount due in anyone  month 
combined.
This complaint was looked at by an adjudicator   Sunny disagreed. A different adjudicator 
then looked at the complaint again  and reached  a different outcome.
Our second adjudicator partially upheld  Mr Ss complaint and thought the loans from loan 
four onwards  shouldnt have been given. Sunny hasnt responded to this and the complaint 
was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN67315032But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan four wouldve shown that Mr S 
was likely having problems managing  his money   and that Sunny should  not have 
continued the lending relationship at this point  as Mr S already had loans outstanding with 
other lenders.
Sunny disagreed. It said that it had completed checks with Mr S to establish his existing 
debts before providing him with any of the loans it granted. It supplied a record  of the 
information that Mr S provided.
But by loan four, it wasnt enough to be asking for this information. Sunny shouldve  also 
sought to verify the information it was provided  with. And had Sunny done  so, I think  that it 
wouldve seen that Mr S was borrowing from other lenders at the time and reached the 
conclusion that it should not have been  continuing with the lending  relationship  at this time. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN67315033Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
twelve. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr S was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken out twelve loans within twelve  months. So Sunny ought  
to have realised it was more likely than not Mr S was having to borrow  further to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ss 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ss first loan was for £600,  and loan twelve was for £300  while  this was for a 
lower amount, Mr Ss combined monthly repayments were  the highest  they had ever 
been. At this point  Sunny ought to have known  that Mr S was not likely borrowing to 
meet a temporary  shortfall in his income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan fifteen was 
taken out over a year after Mr Ss first. Mr S had paid large amounts of interest  to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr S lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan twelve  
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ss ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him/her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loan four to eleven and loans twelve to fifteen 
and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
You shouldnt have given Mr S loans four to fifteen.
If you have sold the outstanding debts,  you should  buy these back if you are able to do so 
and then take the following steps. If you are not able to buy the debts back, then you should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
A) You should add together  the total of the repayments made by Mr S towards interest,  fees 
and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance,  not including anything you 
have already refunded.
B) You should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual  payments  made  by Mr S which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr S originally made  the payments, 
to the date the complaint  is settled.
C) You should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr S as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr S having made 
overpayments then you should refund these overpayments  with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
Ref: DRN67315034date the complaint is settled. You should  then refund the amounts calculated  in A and B 
and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans [and any principal youve 
already written-off].  If this results in a surplus, then the surplus  should  be paid to Mr S. 
However, if there is still an outstanding balance then you should try to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with Mr S. You shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal 
you have already written-off. 
E) You should remove any adverse information  recorded on Mr Ss credit file in relation to 
loans four to seven.  The overall pattern of Mr Ss borrowing for loans twelve  to fifteen means 
any information recorded about  them is adverse, so you should remove these  loans entirely 
from Mr Ss credit  file. You do not have to remove outstanding loans from Mr Ss credit file 
until these have been repaid, but you should still remove  any adverse information  recorded 
about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  you to deduct tax from this interest.  You should  give Mr S a 
certificate showing  how much tax youve deducted, if they ask for one. 
decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ss complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 May 2020
