The most recent correspondence from STF shows there is an outstanding balance on loans 
22 and 23. 
One of our adjudicators looked at Miss Gs complaint. She didnt think STF were wrong to 
approve Miss Gs first five loans. But by loan six, the adjudicator thought STF ought to have 
realised that Miss Gs pattern of lending was showing signs that these loans had become 
unsustainable for her. So, the adjudicator upheld Miss Gs complaint about loans 6- 23. 
It appears that Miss G agreed with our adjudicators opinion.
STF didnt agree with our adjudicator but offered to write off Miss Gs outstanding balance. In 
addition it provided the following for this service to consider;
 
STF says it adhered to all the guidelines, regulations and its policies and procedures 
which fell within good industry practices at the time. So, it didnt make an error when 
it approved these loans. 
STF has told us it didnt have the technology at the time to accept and keep copies of 
bank statements, wages and utility bills. But Since November 2018, it says it now 
has the technology and software for both its agents and customers using our online 
applications to provide and attach evidence to be able to proceed.
STFs offer was put to Miss G but she declined it. 
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice 
at the time these loans were provided. 
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss G could 
repay these loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number 
of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and the 
consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that STF 
should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable 
for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all means for Miss Gs complaint. 
Loans 1-5The adjudicator didnt think it was wrong of STF to have provided Miss Gs first five loans. 
Both STF and Miss G appear to have accepted our adjudicators findings about these loans.
So, I wont comment further on these loans, or the level of individual checks STF did before 
approving these loans, as I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement. But as these 
loans form part of the borrowing relationship Miss G had with STF, they are something I 
have taken into account when considering the later loans.
Loans 6-23
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 6-23 because I
didnt consider it necessary to do so. Indeed, I think that from loan 6, STFs checks really 
needed to go further than just relying on the information Miss G told it. 
At this point in the lending relationship, I think STF ought to have been trying to verify Miss 
Gs income and overall expenditure in order to have an accurate understanding of her actual 
financial position.
And in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to
Miss G, STF also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Miss G. I do think STF was wrong to have provided 
loans 6-23 because Miss G wasnt in a position to sustainably repay them for the following 
reasons:
By loan 6, STF ought to have realised Miss G was not managing to repay her
loans sustainably. Miss G had been indebted to STF for less than 10 months and had 
taken six loans within this period. The fact that Miss G had taken a number of loans 
within a relatively short period of time, coupled with the fact that the loan amounts 
(and therefore the weekly commitments) were increasing her overall indebtedness, 
supports my view that Miss Gs indebtedness had become unsustainable.
Miss G was requesting a new loan before she repaid her current one. She did this on 
six occasions prior to loan 6s approval. So STF ought to have realised it was more 
likely than not Miss G was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her 
previous borrowing was leaving in her finances and that Miss Gs indebtedness was 
unsustainable.
When Miss G applied for loan 6, she was still repaying loan 4. This meant her weekly 
repayments had increased from £20 (at the time of loan 1) to £85 a week. This to me 
shows that Miss G wasnt reducing her indebtedness to STF. She may have been 
repaying her loans in line with the credit agreements, but she wasnt actually making 
any headway into reducing her overall capital balance. So Miss G had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to STF over an extended period.
I think that Miss G lost out because STF continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Gs indebtedness by allowing
her to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the length of time coupled with the number of loans which Miss G borrowed was 
likely to have had negative implications on Miss Gs ability to access mainstream 
credit and so kept her in the market for these loans.
So overall, I think STF were wrong to approve loans 6-23. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what
might have happened had it stopped lending to Miss G from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought
to have. Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that
question.
For example, having been declined this lending Miss G may have simply left matters there,
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed
between her and this particular lender which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt
a viable option, she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative 
assuming that was even possible.
Or, Miss G may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Miss G in a compliant way at this time. 
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Miss G would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what
Im satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
I think STF were wrong to approve loans 6-23.
If the debt has been sold to a third party, STF should if it wishes, buy the debt
back and then carry out the redress below. If it isnt able to, or doesnt wish to buy the debt
back, then it needs to work with the third party to achieve the same results.
STF should refund all interest, fees and charges that Miss G paid for loans 6-21.
Add 8%, simple a year interest from the date of payment to the date of settlement*;
Remove all unpaid interest, fees and charges from the outstanding loan balance on 
loans 22 and 23
STF should then rework these two loan accounts so that Miss G only has to repay 
the principal borrowed for loans 22 and 23. It should treat any repayments made by 
Miss G (and the third party if applicable) as if it went towards the principal balance.
If and when Miss G has repaid enough to repay the principal due for loans 22 and 23, 
then any overpayment should be refunded to her. To this overpayment, 8% simple a 
year interest should be added from the date of the overpayment came due to the 
date of settlement*;
However, if after doing the above, an outstanding principal balance remains, STF (if 
they own the debt) can use the refund from loans 6  21 to offset this sum. But if a 
balance still remains after doing that STF should try and come to an affordable 
arrangement with Miss G to repay the balance. But Id remind STF of its obligation to 
treat her fairly.STF should remove loans 6-23 entirely from Miss Gs credit file. STF does not have 
to remove loans 22 and 23 from Miss Gs credit file until these have been repaid, but 
it should still remove any adverse information recorded about these loans in the 
meantime.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. STF should give 
Miss G a certificate showing how much tax is deducted, if she asks for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Miss Gs complaint in part.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right for Miss G as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 June 2021.
