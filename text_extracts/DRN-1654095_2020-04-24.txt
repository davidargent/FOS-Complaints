The complaint
Mr K complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA hasnt refunded him the cost of an item 
he didnt receive.
What happened
On 20 October 2019 Mr K bought two items from a seller and used his PayPal account to 
pay for them. Mr K contacted the seller saying that, while a delivery was received, only one 
of the items he bought was included. As the seller didnt respond he raised a buyer claim 
with PayPal, asking for a partial refund. 
PayPal contacted the seller to see if they would agree to a partial refund but they didnt 
respond. So, PayPal considered the claim under their Buyer Protection policy. They 
explained to Mr K they couldnt issue a partial refund but that he was eligible for a full refund. 
To receive this, he had to return the item that was delivered back to the seller and provide 
delivery tracking information to evidence this. 
Mr K was unable to do this as hed already given the item to a friend, so he couldnt return it. 
And so, as PayPal didnt receive tracking details to show the item had been returned in line 
with their request, they declined Mr Ks claim.
As Mr K remained dissatisfied, a complaint was raised and referred to our service. One of 
our investigators looked in to the matter but he didnt think PayPal had acted unfairly, or 
outside their Buyer Protection policy, by declining the claim. He explained that, under the 
terms of the policy, in instances of one of the items ordered not being received, PayPal may 
require the buyer to return the item(s) that were delivered back to the seller. And upon proof 
of delivery being provided, it may allow PayPal to award the claim in favour of the buyer. 
Our investigator acknowledged the reason why Mr K couldnt return the item that was 
received  due it being given to a friend  but he didnt think this meant PayPal had acted 
unfairly. So, he didnt think they had to do anything further.
Mr K disagreed and so the matter has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, Ive come to same 
outcome as our investigator and for largely the same reasons. I know this will be 
disappointing for Mr K but let me explain why.
In instances of an item not being received, or if the item received isnt what was ordered, 
PayPal can reimburse the buyer through their Buyer Protection policy. This protection 
however doesnt cover every eventuality. And so, Ive considered whether PayPal has 
applied their policy fairly when declining Mr Ks claim.  Section eight of the policy, What is Significantly Not as Described (SNAD)?, says:
a.Your purchase is Significantly Not as Described if it is materially different from the 
last description of it that you received from the payment recipient before you paid for 
it (which, for exclusively online purchases, shall be taken to be the payment 
recipients description of the purchase in the relevant online listing) (Purchase 
Description). Here are some non-exhaustive examples:

e. You purchased 3 items from a payment recipient but received only 2. 
As Mr K says he only received one of two items, Im satisfied his purchase was significantly 
not as described. And section six of the policy, Cooperating with PayPal to resolve the 
problem, says:
Whether you are the buyer or the payment recipient, for the purpose of resolving the 
problem, PayPal may request and require you to (and you shall in a timely manner): 
(i) provide documentary evidence (at your own expense, unless PayPal agrees 
otherwise) to support your position (including, without limitation, proof of delivery, 
receipts, third party evaluations and police reports); and (ii) take any other action that 
PayPal specifies. If you refuse to comply with PayPals requests, PayPal may make a 
final decision in favour of the other party.
As a non-exhaustive guide, PayPal may request and require:
a.the buyer to post back to the payment recipient, to PayPal or to a third party (as 
PayPal may direct) an item that the buyer claims is SNAD and to provide Proof of 
Delivery. 
Ive carefully considered the above and, while Im understanding as to the reason why Mr K 
is unable to return the item he received, the policy clearly states in circumstances of an 
item(s) being significantly not as described that PayPal may require the buyer to return such 
item(s) and provide proof of delivery. 
Im therefore satisfied PayPal acted in line with their policy by requesting Mr K return the 
item to the seller to receive a full refund. I have however thought about whether it was fair for 
them to do this as Mr K wasnt able to return the item and he only wanted a partial refund 
(for the item he didnt receive).
PayPal say they cant facilitate partial refunds  without the sellers approval  as it doesnt 
involve a return of the item(s) or acceptance from the seller. And this could bring instances 
of the seller disagreeing with the claim and thereby loosing a partial amount of the payment. 
So, given PayPal must act fairly to both the buyer and the seller when considering disputes 
over purchased items, I think its understandable that they have processes in place to avoid 
disputes arising from the seller in situations like this. I therefore dont consider it 
unreasonable for PayPal to request items that are significantly not as described to be 
returned to the seller to receive a refund. It follows that, as Mr K didnt do this, I dont think 
PayPal unfairly declined his claim.
I think its also worth noting that section two of the policy, Is PayPal Buyer Protection right 
for me?, says:
The outcome of any decision made by PayPal under PayPal Buyer Protection might 
not always be suitable for your particular needs and you should carefully read these 
terms and consider your options before using PayPal to resolve a problem. If PayPal 
is contacted to resolve a problem, PayPal may require you to take an irreversible action to resolve the problem, which might make it no longer practicable in the 
circumstances for you to resolve the problem in another way. For example, PayPal 
may require you to return the item to the payment recipient under section 6.
So, I think PayPal makes it clear that Buyer Protection may not be suitable for every buyers 
needs when trying to resolve a dispute with a seller. And that they may require a buyer to 
return the item(s) to resolve the matter. Because of this, I think PayPal gave appropriate 
warning to Mr K that this may not be the best way of resolving the dispute and that he should 
consider the other options available to him.
I realise this isnt the outcome Mr K was hoping for and that he feels PayPal should protect 
buyers in instances like this by offering partial refunds. I also appreciate that he considers 
the seller or the delivery provider is most likely responsible for the item going missing. But as 
Ive explained, PayPals Buyer Protection policy doesnt cover every eventuality and, in this 
case, I dont think theyve acted unfairly by declining the claim.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 May 2020.
