The complaint
Mr R complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has failed to provide a refund for a 
purchase that was made fraudulently on his PayPal account.  
What happened
On 10 March 2021 two transactions were made from Mr Rs PayPal account. Mr R contacted 
PayPal the same day about these transactions. The transaction of $220.01 was refunded to 
Mr R. PayPal says this refund was made as it had limited information from the seller. 
The second transaction of $742.01 (Â£560.06) was not refunded by PayPal. It explained that 
it had investigated the transaction and it found no evidence of unauthorised activity on Mr 
Rs account. It also explained that the purchase was for cryptocurrency, which isnt covered 
by the terms of its user agreement.
Mr R wasnt happy with the response from PayPal and so the complaint was referred to this 
service. Our investigator looked into things and initially found in Mr Rs favour, explaining 
there was no evidence that Mr R had purchased cryptocurrency. PayPal responded to this 
opinion with further information. The investigator changed their opinion in light of this new 
evidence. In particular she noted that she had now seen evidence that cryptocurrency had 
been purchased, and this meant the transaction wasnt covered by PayPals buyer 
protection.
Mr R did not agree with the investigators review, so the case has been passed to me  an 
ombudsman  for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on Mr Rs complaint as I reached the same outcome as the 
investigator but for different reasons. The decision is set out below. 
What I said in my provisional decision
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, my review of the evidence has led me to the same overall conclusions as
the investigator previously set out, but for different reasons which I will now go on to explain.
PayPal refunded one transaction on the basis that there was no evidence from the seller that
the purchase was for cryptocurrency. The remaining transaction has been not been refunded
as the seller confirmed cryptocurrency has been purchased. PayPals user agreement
protection does not cover cryptocurrency, and this is one of the main reasons why PayPal
and the investigator didnt think the transaction should be refunded. I agree that the
transaction seems to be for cryptocurrency, but the main focus when considering Mr Rs
case is whether he authorised the transaction.
The relevant law here is the Payment Services Regulations 2017, and broadly speaking
Mr R is responsible for any payments that he has authorised (either by making them himself
or allowing someone else to) and he isnt responsible for unauthorised payments. The terms
of Mr Rs user agreement also explain that PayPal will not refund disputed payments if it can
show that the account holder has authorised that payment. So, the key question here is
whether PayPal has acted fairly in concluding that Mr R did authorise the disputed payment.
Mr R maintains he did not authorise the payment. Hes explained it occurred in the middle of
the night and he reported the payment as soon as he noticed it. Mr R says the purchase is
not in keeping with his normal spending on the account too. PayPal has also provided
evidence to support its review of Mr Rs complaint. This includes account access history and
account usage. Looking at all the evidence I think PayPal has fairly declined Mr Rs claim for
the following reasons:
PayPal has provided log in details for Mr Rs account. This shows that his account
was accessed using Mr Rs correct username and password. Theres no indication in
the information Ive seen that incorrect details were entered or that there was any
attempt to change Mr Rs log in details.
Looking at PayPals technical records, they show Mr R accessed his account over 50
times between September 2019 and June 2021 using the same Visitor ID. The Visitor
ID is a term PayPal uses to define where the same device and browser have been
used for a login. In particular, the records show the same Visitor ID was used to
access Mr Rs account when the disputed transaction was made. So because of this,
and as there isnt any plausible explanation how an unauthorised individual would
have access to Mr Rs frequently used device and browser, I think it was most likely
the account was being accessed by Mr R, rather than a third party.
Mr R says the transactions werent made by him but hasnt provided any details or
information about how his account may have been accessed by a third party.
Taking everything into account, I find, on balance, that Mr R authorised the disputed
transaction. It follows that PayPal is entitled to hold him liable for it.

Responses to provisional decision 
PayPal did not have a substantive response to the provisional decision. Mr R responded and 
requested copies of the technical records PayPal had provided. This request was put to 
PayPal, and it did not consent to this information being shared with Mr R. PayPal explained 
that the screen shots contained proprietary and security information that needed to be kept 
confidential. PayPal did consent to the sharing of general information, and Mr R was 
provided with an overview of what the evidence included. 
Mr R remained dissatisfied with this response and explained it was unfair to make a decision 
against him when he was unable to review the information. Mr R requested the issuing of a 
final decision be delayed until he had completed a subject access request with PayPal and 
received the necessary information. I considered Mr Rs request, but I did not think it necessary to delay the issuing of the final 
decision. Although I understand Mr R wishes to review the information PayPal holds about 
his account, he has already been provided with some key details about what the information 
contains. Including the information I have relied upon when reaching my decision. In 
particular my provisional decision explained that the visitor ID details do not suggest that the 
transactions were carried out by a third party.
Overall, based on the available evidence I find it most likely Mr R authorised the 
transactions, so I wont be asking PayPal to refund Mr R.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is not to uphold Mr Rs complaint against 
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 November 2022.
