DRN-1050629
The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) lent to him irresponsibly. Mr 
D is being represented by a third party but to avoid any confusion, I will refer just to Mr D in 
this decision.
What happened
In early 2017, Mr D applied  and was accepted  for a loan of £9,500 with NatWest. At the 
time, he told NatWest that the main purpose of the loan was to consolidate existing debts 
and to upgrade and maintain his accommodation. 
Mr D says NatWest shouldnt have provided him the loan. He says that he suffers from 
mental health issues and was living in 24-hour high support service accommodation, where 
he required daily support to complete essential tasks. And as a result of some threatening 
incidents with other residents, Mr D says he was particularly vulnerable at the time he took 
out the loans as he wanted to use the funds to secure his accommodation. Mr D also says 
that his only income was from benefits. He would like the remainder of the loan to be written 
off.
NatWest doesnt believe its decision to lend to Mr D was irresponsible. It says it followed the 
correct process when assessing the application and that it must treat all its customers 
equally. NatWest says it completed the usual checks to make sure Mr D could afford the 
loan and there was nothing in Mr Ds application that caused it to believe it shouldnt lend to 
Mr D.
Our investigator didnt think NatWest had done anything wrong. She said that NatWest had 
carried out all the necessary checks she would have expected it to and didnt think it 
reasonably should have had any concerns. She didnt believe Mr D said anything to suggest 
he didnt understand the product he was applying for and that he made repayments for 18 
months  showing that the loan was affordable at the time it was applied for.
Mr D didnt agree so the complaint has been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive come to the same conclusion as our investigator. I realise this will come 
as a disappointment to Mr D but I have explained my reasons for this below. 
I dont doubt what Mr D has told us  that he was in a particularly vulnerable position at the 
time he took out this loan. But I have to consider what NatWest knew at the time of the 
application and whether its decision to lend was irresponsible.
During the call where Mr D applied for the loan, NatWest asked him several questions to 
establish Mr Ds circumstances and ability to repay the loan. Mr D told NatWest his income 
was £970 a month after tax. He also appears to have had minimal outgoings  primarily a service charge of £30 every fortnight. During his call with NatWest where he applied for the 
loan, he also mentioned that the service charge may be decreasing and explained that he 
had no housing costs. In this call, I can hear that the advisor gave Mr D examples of his 
monthly payment if he took the loan over different terms so he could consider which one was 
suitable for him. Mr D asked for the loan term to be over four years, making the monthly 
repayments £282.48  giving him a monthly disposable income of around £600 for his 
general living expenses, which NatWest considered acceptable for Mr D to be able to live 
on. Most of the information Mr D gave NatWest can be evidenced through his current 
account  which was also held with NatWest. So, based on all the information NatWest had 
available to it at the time, I think it took reasonable precautions to ensure the loan was 
affordable to Mr D.
Mr D has also told us that his income was from a combination of benefits and that it would 
have to be reapplied for after three years. Benefits are a form of income and I can hear on 
the application call that Mr D told NatWest that his benefits were guaranteed for the next four 
years. Given that the term of the loan was also four years, I dont think it was unreasonable 
for NatWest to have relied on the information given by Mr D and approved a loan based on 
that income.
Mr D told NatWest that he wanted to use the loan funds to repay his existing debts and to 
upgrade his home. He also referred to using some of the money to buy furniture and take 
driving lessons. The advisor was aware that Mr D was in supported accommodation, but Mr 
D referred to buying a new door and furnishings, which arent unusual items for any type of 
home. So, I dont think there was anything Mr D told NatWest during the application that 
would have caused it to think it shouldnt lend to Mr D.
Mr D has referred to ongoing mental health issues in his correspondence with this service. 
But I wouldnt expect NatWest to automatically decline a loan application on that basis  
instead it must consider the circumstances of each loan application before making a lending 
decision. In this case, NatWest has made it clear it wasnt aware of these issues until 
recently  and from listening to his application call, it wasnt something Mr D made clear to 
NatWest. So, I dont think it would be reasonable for me to have expected them to take 
account of something they werent aware of.
Mr D has said that this outstanding debt is continuing to affect his mental health. The 
account is now with NatWests recoveries team and now that NatWest is aware of Mr Ds 
circumstances, it has said it wont be instructing debt collectors. It is now up to Mr D and 
NatWest to work together to discuss the future repayment of the outstanding debt. And now 
that NatWest is aware of Mr Ds circumstances, I would expect it to continue to take these 
into account when dealing with Mr D.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 March 2020.
