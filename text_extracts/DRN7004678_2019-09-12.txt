K820x#14complaint
Mr G has complained that the cancellation fees charged by Fresh  Insurance  Services  Group  
Limited were  too high when he cancelled his motor policy. He also complained  that Fresh 
didnt deal with his complaint properly and falsified dates of letters.
background
Mr G took a policy through  Fresh an intermediary on 22 April 2018. He decided  to cancel his 
policy on 3 September  2018 some four months  later.
He paid a total of £1,554.56 for his premium, which included a charge of £183.50  for the 
telematics box, £62.00 for breakdown  cover  and £10 broker  fee. All of these were non-
refundable if the policy was cancelled after the first 14 days.  Plus Fresh gave him a discount 
of £133.22.
On cancellation  of the policy, Mr G received a refund of £711.65. Mr G didnt think this was 
enough. Fresh  said the refund was in line with its terms and conditions. Mr G remained 
dissatisfied and brought  his complaint to us.
The adjudicator didnt think Fresh has done  anything wrong as its refund was in line with the 
terms. Mr G maintained it was still unfair,  so his complaint has been passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not upholding this 
complaint. Ill now explain  why.
Fresh has shown us Mr G bought his policy through  a website, where that webpage said By 
clicking NEXT you are confirming you have read and agree  to Terms and Conditions, 
Privacy Policy, Telematics Terms and Conditions. These were available  to read and 
detailed what happened if the policy was cancelled after the first 14 days. It included the 
cancellation fee and that Fresh retains 10% of the premium refunded by the insurer on any 
such cancellation. 
Therefore Im satisfied  Mr G had to the opportunity to consider this before he bought his 
policy. And indeed  consider  them  within the first 14 days of his policy.  Therefore, if he had 
found them  unsavoury at that time,  Mr G could found cover elsewhere.
This service doesnt tell intermediaries like Fresh, what  it must  charge its customers for its 
services, as thats a matter for the regulator  the Financial Conduct Authority. However, we 
look to see if the charges  were brought to the consumers notice and were applied  fairly.  
Fresh is an intermediary and I consider its entitled to detail its terms and conditions  in the 
manner it has. Those terms  and conditions say that if a policy is cancelled after the first 14 
days and before the expiry date, Fresh will charge a £60 cancellation. It will also retain 10% 
of the refunded premium from the insurer. This is in addition to the £10 broker  fee when the 
policy was set up. I consider this is reasonable. 
I appreciate Mr G believes all Fresh does  is click a button to cancel a policy  but thats not 
the case. It must communicate with Mr G, his insurer  and the providers of the telematics box 
Ref: DRN70046782and the breakdown provider, all of which it doesnt  have to do if the policy  expires. And its 
entitled to be recompensed for those activities. Additionally Fresh also gave Mr G a discount 
of £133.22, which was to his advantage.
Mr G paid a total of £1,554.56. Of this £1,432.38 went to his insurer, which meant £122.28  
was kept by Fresh.  
This was for £183.50 for the telematics box, £62.00 for the breakdown cover and £10 broker 
fee  all of which arent  refundable as detailed in the terms and conditions. That actually  
totals £225.50. But Fresh discounted it by £133.22  bringing it back  to £122.28.
So when Mr G cancelled his policy, the insurer returned £857.38 to Fresh. This was for his 
time on risk. As per the terms  and conditions, Fresh retained 10% of this, which was £85.73. 
Fresh also charged its £60 cancellation fee as detailed in the terms and conditions.  This 
meant Mr G received £711.65. 
Therefore I consider  Fresh has done  nothing  wrong.
As regards  issues with the dates of the letter Fresh sent to Mr G following his complaint, the 
adjudicator has adequately  explained this so I wont repeat  it here.
my final decision
So for these reasons its my final decision that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 October  2019.
