The complaint
Mr G complains Amtrust Europe Limited have unfairly declined his claim for accidental 
damage to his Sofa.
All references to Amtrust also include their agents.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The policy says it excludes damage that has occurred gradually
Amtrusts engineer inspected the sofa. They said the material had worn away as the 
Velcro strip inside the sofa had been making contact with the edges of the sweat 
cover-  and worn it away over a period of time
Looking at the engineers comments, and pictures of the damage, I cant see their 
conclusion is obviously wrong, so Im persuaded the damage did happen gradually
However, given the location of the damage, this wouldve been occurring out of sight, 
so there was no way Mr G could have reasonably been aware of this damage 
occurring  so he wasnt able to mitigate or prevent it
Because of this he would have only become aware at the point the rip occurred an 
accidental event
Considering the information available to me, though I can appreciate Amtrusts 
position, I think for the reasons Ive explained above, on a fair and reasonable basis, 
they should deal with Mr Gs claim
So for these reasons I uphold Mr Gs complaint.
My final decision
My final decision Is that I uphold Mr Gs claim.
To put things right, Amtrust Europe Limited should now deal with Mr Gs claim under the 
terms and conditions of the policy.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 July 2021.
