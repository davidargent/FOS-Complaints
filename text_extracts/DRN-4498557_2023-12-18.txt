The complaint
Mr W complains that TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED trading as TransUnion 
treated him unfairly when dealing with his credit file.
What happened
Mr W raised the following complaint points with TransUnion:
- They invited him to apply for a credit card when it shouldnt have because he had a 
poor credit rating
- He was unhappy with the credit score TransUnion were providing
- He wanted a financial association with his mother removed from his credit file.
Mr W wanted TransUnion to pay him £500 to compensate him for these things.
TransUnion didnt uphold Mr Ws complaint, they said they dont perform any marketing on 
behalf of lenders or issue invitations to apply for credit. They also explained that the credit 
score is dependant on the information they receive from lenders and other. And it is a 
snapshot of how they perceive a customers credit rating at that point in time. TransUnion 
didnt mention the financial association with Mr Ws mother in their final response.
Mr W remained unhappy and so brought his complaint to this service. 
Our Investigator issued his initial findings on Mr Ws case not upholding it. He didnt think 
TransUnion had invited Mr W to apply for credit. He explained that although Mr W was 
unhappy with his credit score this was only an indication for his purposes, and not something 
TransUnion shared with lenders. 
Mr W disagreed with the Investigator as he hadnt issued any findings on the association 
TransUnion was reporting between Mr W and his mother. TransUnion initially said they 
needed to consider this separately as it hadnt been part of the original complaint. But after 
some intervention TransUnion agreed to look into this. They said the association had now 
been removed, and through the Investigator offered Mr W £100 for not having dealt with it 
sooner. Mr W rejected the offer and so the matter has now been passed to me to decide.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise that Ive summarised this complaint in less detail than the parties and Ive done so
using my own words. Ive concentrated on what I consider to be the key issues. The rules 
that govern this service allow me to do so. But this doesnt mean that Ive not considered
everything that both parties have given to me. I will address each point in turn.
Invitation to apply for credit
Mr W says TransUnion invited him to apply for a credit card. TransUnion has confirmed to 
this service they dont perform any marketing or send invitations to apply for credit. Having 
looked at TransUnions website I cant see anything that contradicts what they have told us, 
and I have seen no other evidence that supports TransUnion did this. Based on this I cant 
fairly say they have done anything wrong here.
Credit score
I understand that Mr W may not like or agree with the credit score that TransUnion has 
provided to him. But as its been explained to him, the score is only visible to him, it is not 
shared with potential lenders. Mr W hasnt told us or TransUnion that the information about 
his accounts is incorrect on his credit file. So, I dont think its obvious to me that they have 
given him a wrong score. There are many factors TransUnion use when calculating the 
score through an automated process  they have given examples of these. So, I expect 
certain things are impacting the score differently to how Mr W thinks they might or should.
It might help Mr W to look at the score as TransUnions view rather than something which is 
set in stone. As ultimately any lenders decision will not be based on it but will be based on 
their own internal checks. 
Financial association
Mr W asked for the financial association between him and his mother to be removed from his 
credit file as he says this shouldnt have been there. Although TransUnion didnt act on this 
at the time Mr W raised it, they have now removed the association and have offered Mr W 
£100 for this. I think this is a fair offer in the circumstances, so I wont be asking them to do 
more.
Putting things right
On acceptance of this decision TransUnion should pay Mr W £100 for the distress and 
inconvenience caused to him by them not dealing with the financial association between him 
and his mother sooner.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I currently uphold this complaint and I require TRANSUNION 
INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED trading as TransUnion to carry out the actions as set out 
under the Putting things right section of this decision
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 January 2024.
