K820x#14complaint
Mr O complained that Firstplus Financial  Group  PLC mis-sold him secured loans.
background
On 3 February 2006, Mr O took out a 20 year secured loan with Firstplus.  It was for £65,500, 
plus £12,655.55 for PPI.
About a year later, on 26 February 2007,  Mr O took a new secured loan over a 25 year term. 
This loan was for £77,100, plus £15,366.03 for PPI. The loan repaid  the 2006  loan, and 
Firstplus sent Mr O a cheque for £7,100  because  Mr O wanted  to pay off some of his other 
unsecured credit elsewhere. 
In January 2019, Mr O complained to Firstplus  that it had mis-sold his loans. Helped by a 
representative, he said that he had mental  health issues and believed  the loan shouldnt  
have been granted. In its final response  letter, Firstplus  said that Mr O had complained too 
late for it to be able to consider his complaint.
Mr O, helped by a representative, contacted this service. He believed  the loans had been 
mis-sold.
An investigator considered Mr Os complaint. She said that we couldnt  look at the 2006  loan 
which had been  repaid  in 2007. She explained that there are rules about what this service 
can and cant look at. Were unable to look at complaints referred  to us more  than six years  
after the event  complained about, or more than three years from the date on which  the 
customer should have  known they had cause to complain. 
Mr Os 2006 loan had been taken out, and closed, more than six years ago. When  the loan 
was paid off in 2007, Mr O would have  been aware  of the terms of the loan and could have 
complained at that point. So the investigator said we couldnt consider the 2006 loan.
But the investigator did consider the 2007 loan. She looked at the documents and thought 
Firstplus had done enough  to make sure the loan was affordable and terms clear. And Mr O 
had been making  repayments on time between  2007  and 2019.  The investigator thought that 
as Mr O hadnt told Firstplus about  his problems  with mental health and alcoholism, it wasnt  
unfair that Firstplus had made the loan.
Mr O didnt agree. He said he hadnt  been  paid as much as the figure on the income and 
expenditure form completed at the time of the 2007 loan. And his representative sent a letter  
dated October 2019 from Mr Os doctor,  which said he had mental health problems, and 
alcohol and drug misuse. The letter said that Mr O hadnt been formally  diagnosed until 
2012, but it was highly  probable that these conditions were present during the period of 
1994 to 2012. The investigator  didnt change her view, and Mr O asked for an ombudsman 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The 2006  loan
Ref: DRN35346422This service is bound by rules, set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), about what  we 
can and cant consider. Among other factors, those rules say we cant  look at a complaint if it 
was made  more than:   
-six years  after the event complained of; or if later
-three years from when the customer was aware, or ought  reasonably  to have been 
aware, of cause for complaint.
Both of Mr Os loans were granted more  than six years before he complained.  But the 2006  
loan was also closed  more than six years ago, in 2007. At that point, I consider Mr O ought  
reasonably to have  been  aware that he had cause for complaint. So I find that this service  
doesnt have jurisdiction to consider the 2006  complaint, because Mr O brought  it too late.
Although the 2007 loan was also taken out more than six years  ago, Firstplus  has agreed  to 
this service considering  that loan.
Whether Mr Os 2007 loan was mis-sold
Mr O and his representative have raised  two points to argue that the 2007  loan was mis-
sold, saying that: 
-he didnt have the income stated on the income  and expenditure form, so it wasnt  
affordable, and 
-his mental health impacted on his ability to manage his money..
Ive considered these  two points.
Whether the 2007  loan was affordable
Ive seen the documents which were completed  when Mr O applied for the 2007  loan. These  
include the assessment  of Mr Os income  and expenditure,  as well as information  about his 
property, which hed bought in 2004  and on which a full valuation  was carried  out prior to the 
2007 loan. The section about income  shows that the lender saw a year  to date pay figure 
of £24,943 after 43 weeks of the 52 week year. This was calculated as a gross monthly 
income of £2,513. 
After this length of time, I wouldnt expect Firstplus to have kept copies of the payslip on 
which it based this. I note that Mr Os representative obtained a letter in 2019 from his former 
employer, which also said that it no longer  had records of what  Mr O earned during 2007. 
This 2019 letter said that a standard hourly rate in 2007 would have been £9.74 an hour.  
When evidence is unclear or conflicts, I make my decision on what  I think it more likely to 
have happened. Here, the application  information  was completed at the time of the 
application. And its very precise, so I consider  its more likely than not that the person  
handling the application had indeed seen evidence to back up the year-to-date pay figure of 
£24,943 after 43 weeks of the 52 week year.  
In contrast, the ex-employers 2019 letter, some nine years after Mr O had left his 
employment and 12 years after the loan application, isnt precise. It specifically says it no 
longer had Mr Os pay records for 2007. And I consider that its likely that Mr O, whod been 
working there some 22 years since 1985,  would have earned more  than a standard  hourly 
rate  and there might have been bonuses and overtime too. So I find that its likely that the 
figures on Firstpluss forms,  completed  at the time,  are accurate.  
Ref: DRN35346423Based on what Firstplus was told about  Mr Os income and expenditure, the loan seemed  
affordable. Ive also taken  into account the fact that Mr O did pay his 2007 loan without going 
into arrears. Taking all these factors into account, Im not persuaded that the loan was 
unaffordable when  Firstplus approved it.
Whether Firstplus knew about Mr Os mental health
Mr Os January 2019 complaint to Firstplus, submitted by his representative,  said that 
Firstplus mis-sold the 2007 loan because his mental health impacted on his ability to 
manage his money.  The representative attached  a mental health  evidence form, completed 
by Mr Os GP in October 2018, which set out a diagnosis from October 2016 and dates not 
known for other diagnoses.
In the later submissions to this service, Mr Os representative has also sent an October 2019 
letter from Mr Os GP. These set out Mr Os medical  history.  As Ive set out above, the 
October 2019 letter said that Mr O hadnt  been formally diagnosed until 2012, but it was 
highly  probable that these conditions were present during the period of 1994  to 2012. It 
also said that it was unlikely that these  difficulties would not have been evident  at the time 
this loan was sold to him.
I have considered this medical evidence carefully.  But whats missing is any evidence that 
medical evidence  was supplied to Firstplus  before  the loan was approved.  The first time 
theres any record of Firstplus being told of Mr Os medical difficulties was January 2019,  
some 12 years after the 2007  loan was approved. I note that Mr Os GP has stated that it 
was unlikely that his difficulties wouldnt have  been  evident at the time the loan was 
advanced. But I note that there was no formal diagnosis until 2012. 
Mr Os application was made by phone, and Firstplus wasnt obliged  to interview Mr O in 
person. Nor did it have  to ask him whether or not he had any health  problems. Theres  
nothing to show Firstplus  was aware of any medical  difficulties until Mr Os representative 
wrote in January  2019. As Firstplus wasnt aware of Mr Os health problems at the time, it 
couldnt have  known that this might be a reason not to lend to him. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or reject  my decision before 
10 March 2020
