The complaint
Mrs W complains about the way PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA handled her refund 
request following a purchase for an item that was not as described. 
What happened
Mrs W purchased an item for which she paid £150. Mrs W sent payment for the item via 
PayPal on 31 July 2021. 
Mrs W says when she received the item she realised it was not as described and so 
contacted the seller immediately. Mrs W asked the seller for their shipping address so she 
could return the item. Mrs W says the seller sent her the return address and told her once 
the item was received she would receive a full refund. Mrs W says at the same time she filed 
a dispute with PayPal owing to the item being significantly not as described.
Mrs W says she returned the item to the address she was told by the seller. She says she 
sent the item via courier so it could be tracked and it was delivered on 11 August 2021. The 
courier provided Mrs W with a photograph confirming delivery and said the courier GPS 
shows they were on the correct street at the time of delivery. 
PayPal contacted Mrs W on 19 August 2021 to tell her the seller offered a full refund if the 
item was returned. PayPal told Mrs W she would need to return the item and upload the 
tracking information in the Resolution Centre before 29 August. PayPal also provided the 
shipping address for the item to be returned to. 
When Mrs W uploaded the tracking information to evidence delivery of the return she says 
PayPal rejected her claim. Mrs W wasnt happy and so raised a complaint with PayPal.
PayPal said following Mrs Ws dispute regarding the item she purchased it contacted her to 
let her know the process for returning the item. It said it told Mrs W to initiate the return 
shipment and upload the tracking information in the Resolution Centre before 29 August 
2021. PayPal advised her to retain a copy of the shipping label to verify the address. 
PayPal provided Mrs W with the shipping address and told her once the seller had received 
the item the refund would be issued and the case closed. PayPal said it declined the claim 
because when Mrs W provided the tracking details it showed the item was returned to a 
different incorrect address. PayPal said it followed correct procedures and acted in 
accordance with the User Agreement and policies. 
Unhappy with the response from PayPal Mrs W referred her complaint to this service. Our 
investigator looked into things for her. Our investigator upheld the complaint. She said Mrs 
W had sent the item to the sellers address and provided the relevant tracking information as 
required by PayPal. The investigator said Mrs W had done all she could to mitigate her loss 
and she cant be held responsible for the seller giving her the wrong address. The 
investigator upheld Mrs Ws complaint and told PayPal to refund her £150. PayPal didnt 
agree. It maintained that Mrs W didnt adhere to its Buyer protection guidelines and shipped 
the item back to a different address rather than the address specified by PayPal. And so the 
complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where information is unclear or incomplete as is the case here I reach my conclusions on 
the balance of probabilities, that is my decision is based on what I think is more likely to have 
happened than not. 
PayPal has provided detailed submissions in response to the investigators view which Ive 
read and considered. But on balance I cannot agree fully with its conclusion. 
In this case I think Mrs W registered the dispute within the timescale set out by the user 
agreement. She also, as requested by PayPal, sent the item back by courier and retained 
evidence of shipping. The seller provided Mrs W with the postal address to send the item 
back to. I have seen the email from the seller and it is the same email address as the PayPal 
account for the seller so I can see why Mrs W sent the item back to that address. Mrs W did 
all of this within the timescales set out by the user agreement.
PayPals user agreement says to be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection the buyer must 
attempt to contact the seller to resolve the issue directly before filing a claim. Mrs W 
contacted the seller directly in the first instance to try and resolve the matter. The seller 
agreed to refund Mrs W if she sent the item back and provided her with the address to ship 
to. Mrs W says she was concerned because the item was significantly not as described and 
so she filed a dispute with PayPal despite hearing from the seller. 
I have reviewed the relevant sections of the user agreement and under our online dispute 
resolution process it says the buyer must comply with PayPals shipping requests in a 
timely manner, if youre filing a Significantly Not as Described claim PayPal may require you, 
at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller.and to provide proof of delivery. And 
this is what Mrs W did. The agreement doesnt specify the item needs to be sent to an 
address provided by PayPal and so I cant say Mrs W did not adhere to the Buyer protection 
guidelines.  
Mrs W says PayPal provided her with the wrong return address. She says the address is 
incorrect since the post code doesnt match the street address. I checked this myself and 
she is correct. So even if Mrs W had posted the item to the address provided by PayPal the 
item wouldnt have been received in any event. 
I think Mrs W acted in line with the terms of the user agreement and acted reasonably in 
trying to resolve the issue with the item. 
Taking everything into account I think the issues that have arisen arent caused by Mrs W. 
She has done her best to act in line with the user agreement terms. 
Overall in the individual circumstances of this matter I think its fair and reasonable for 
PayPal to provide a refund of the money Mrs W paid for this item. And so I think the 
investigators proposed resolution of the complaint is fair and reasonable. 
My final decision
My final decision is I uphold this complaint. To put things right PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should refund £150 to Mrs W. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 May 2022.
