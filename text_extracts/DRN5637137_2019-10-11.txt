K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains about Aviva Insurance Limited.  
background
Mr S took out insurance with Aviva  on 23 July 2018. On 30 July 2018 a piece of artwork was 
damaged and Mr S made a claim. Aviva declined the claim as they considered the 
replacement cost to be below the policy excess.  Mr S complained about this, and also 
considered his policy may have been mis-sold. 
One of our investigators  considered the matter but did not find in Mr S favour. So the case 
has been referred to me for a final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I wont be upholding the complaint either, for roughly  the same  reasons as the investigator. 
Looking at the alleged mis-sale first, Mr S sourced  and purchased  the policy without  any 
advice from Aviva. On that basis I cant find them liable  if it isnt the cover Mr S required. I do 
note though that the policy did cover some  of Mr S needs, so equally  I cant  say that no 
cover was being provided. Neither of these  means Aviva should refund  any premiums or 
meet any claim. 
Turning to the damage whilst I appreciate Mr S views on what  he could have sold the work  
for, it seems clear  that it could have been  replaced for much less, and the ability to replace it 
was available  to Mr S. On that basis only the replacement cost is covered by the policy,  and 
as that is less than the policy excess Aviva arent obliged  to pay Mr S anything. I realise 
Mr S will be disappointed by that, but under  his policy that is the cover provided. 
my final decision
I make  no award against Aviva Insurance Limited.  Under the rules of the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or reject  my decision 
before 11 November 2019.
