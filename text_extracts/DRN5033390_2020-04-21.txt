K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs B complain  about delays and lack of communication by National Westminster 
Bank Plc when they switched their joint account.  Mr B also complains that NatWest  added a 
duplicate credit search to his credit file.
background
In October  2018 Mr and Mrs B had a joint account  with another  bank, which they wanted to 
switch to NatWest. They  say there were delays in carrying this out, and when they didnt 
hear from NatWest Mr B had to phone the bank to find out what  was happening, and this 
took time.  NatWest carried out a credit  check, which was recorded on their credit files. But in 
November a second check was carried out, and this was also recorded on Mr Bs credit  file. 
Mr B complained to NatWest about  all of these matters, and NatWest apologised and paid 
him £100 for his trouble and about £36 for his phone calls. It agreed  to remove  the second  
credit search. But after several months,  this had not been done. So Mr B brought  this 
complaint to our Service, on behalf of himself and his wife.
NatWest provided evidence that it had asked the credit  reference agency (CRA) to remove 
the second check, and that the CRA  had replied to say that this had been done. So NatWest 
argued that if the check still appeared, then it must be the CRAs fault.
Our adjudicator did not uphold this complaint. He said NatWest had done what  it could to 
remove the second check,  and if it still showed  up on Mr Bs credit  file then this was not 
NatWests fault. He thought the compensation NatWest had paid for the other issues  was 
fair.
Mr B asked for an ombudsmans decision. He suggested that the CRA couldnt find the 
relevant entry because NatWest had recorded  his occupation incorrectly when it carried  out 
the credit  check.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have seen an email from the CRA to NatWest, dated  1 February 2019, which  says:
I've now removed this search from our system and the customer  will see this 
change as soon as they purchase  a new report.
If the customer has any queries they can contact our Global Consumer Solutions 
team on 0333 321 4043  and 0800 014 2955 from 8am-8pm seven days  a week.
So I infer that NatWest must have provided  enough information for the CRA to identify the 
entry that was to be removed. I havent  seen any evidence to suggest that it is NatWests 
fault that the problem is still persisting.
I asked NatWest if it was possible that it might  still be including the entry in its monthly 
updates to the CRA. But NatWest said that these updates do not include searches.
I therefore agree with the reason our adjudicator gave for not upholding this complaint, but 
there is also another reason which  hasnt  been  mentioned before. On 5 November 2018, 
Ref: DRN50333902NatWest wrote to Mr and Mrs B to say that their application had not been signed, and a 
signed application form was required.  It went on to say this:
Please note,  your application will expire  28 days after the application date of 15 
October 2018. If we dont  receive the required information within this time,  youll 
need to reapply, which  will result in a second credit search  being  carried out.
28 days after 15 October is 12 November,  which is the day on which the signed application 
was delivered. Since the original application  expired  the same day, I dont  agree  that 
NatWest was wrong to conduct a second  search,  and to report it to the CRA.
Finally, I think  the compensation NatWest has paid for the other issues is fair, and is in line 
with what our Service would typically award.
my final decision
So my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision  before  21 May 2020.
