The complaint
Ms W complains about National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest).
She says that NatWest didnt do enough to protect her when she became the victim of a 
scam and would like NatWest to refund her the money she has lost as a result. 
What happened
In May 2022, Ms W was contacted via LinkedIn by an individual with whom she began a 
relationship with. In July 2022, this individual began to talk to her about investment in 
cryptocurrency. Ms W was persuaded to invest and was helped by the individual on how to 
do so. 
Ms W realised it was a scam when she was asked to pay additional fees and taxes to 
access her supposed profits and initial investment. 
By this time, she had paid £110,121.39 to the scammer, as set out below.

Ms W complained to NatWest, but it didnt uphold her complaint.
Unhappy, she complained to this Service. Our Investigator considered the complaint but 
didnt think that it should be upheld. They said that while NatWest could have held a better 
intervention with Ms W, that there was nothing that a further intervention would likely have 
uncovered, and so it wouldnt have made a difference.
Ms W asked for an Ombudsman to consider her complaint, so it has been passed to me to 
make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint, for broadly the same reasons as 
our Investigator. I know this will be disappointing for Ms W, so Ill explain why.
In deciding whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of a complaint, Im required to 
take into account relevant: law and regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards;
codes of practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider having been good industry 
practice at the time.
In broad terms, the starting position at law is that a bank is expected to process payments 
and withdrawals that a customer authorises it to make, in accordance with the Payment 
Services Regulations (PSRs) and the terms and conditions of the customers account. And I 
have taken that into account when deciding whats fair and reasonable in this case.
So, although Ms W didnt intend for the money she paid to go to a scammer, under the 
Payment Services Regulations 2017 and the terms and conditions of her account, she is 
presumed liable for her loss in the first instance. 
However, taking into account the law, regulators rules and guidance, relevant codes of 
practice and what I consider having been good industry practice at the time, I consider 
NatWest should fairly and reasonably:
Have been monitoring accounts and any payments made or received to counter various 
risks, including anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, and 
preventing fraud and scams.
Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that might 
indicate that its customers were at risk of fraud (among other things). This is particularly 
so given the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years, which banks are 
generally more familiar with than the average customer.  
In some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, have taken additional 
steps, or make additional checks, before processing a payment, or in some cases 
declined to make a payment altogether, to help protect customers from the possibility of 
financial harm from fraud. 
In this case, I need to decide whether NatWest acted fairly and reasonably in its dealings 
with Ms W when she authorised payments from her account or whether it could and should 
have done more before processing them. 
Did NatWest act fairly and reasonably in Ms Ws case?Having considered the payments that Ms W made, I think that NatWest should have 
intervened on the fifth payment that Ms W made, as by this time the payments seemed 
unusual for the way Ms W generally ran her account. The intention being to check that 
everything was as it should be.
However, I am aware that NatWest intervened prior to this, and spoke with Ms W about the 
payment she made on 16 July. NatWest has provided me with a copy of this call.
In this, Ms W was asked if she was making this investment herself  or if anyone else had 
made contact with her or asked her to make any payments. She said both  and when 
asked to clarify she said that she was making an investment with her partner. NatWest said 
that it needed to make sure that she wanted to make the payments  and that she wasnt 
being told to make the payments. Ms W confirmed that she wanted to make the payments. 
I do think that NatWest could have asked more questions here than it did  and I dont think 
this intervention went as far as it should of at this time. But I am also not persuaded that 
further questioning from NatWest would have been able to uncover the scam. Ill explain 
why.
By the time that Ms W began making the payments, she considered herself in a relationship 
with the scammer  they had been speaking for several months and Ms W regarded the 
scammer as a partner she was going to have a future with. So even if NatWest had 
questioned her further about the payments, I think that she would have maintained that she 
was entering into an investment with her partner. 
I also consider that Ms W was so taken in by the scammer and that they would have been 
able to alleviate any concerns that she raised with them. And even if she was to have 
researched Bitcore Exchange (where she sent the payments on from her own crypto wallet) I 
dont think that she would have uncovered anything that would have led her to think that she 
was being scammed.
I am also aware that Ms W took out a loan with another bank in order to finance part of the 
payments she made to the scam. This bank has confirmed that the loan was for home 
improvements  but this wasnt the case. So, I think this also shows that Ms W was so under 
the spell of the scammer she would mis-lead a financial institution about what she was 
doing. 
I know that Ms W is upset that NatWest allowed her to increase her daily payment limit on 
her account  but it was her that asked to do this and said that she didnt want any 
interruptions to payments that she was making. 
Ms W has also provided a list of transactions from her crypto account where she sent some 
of the money on to the scammer  I can see that on several occasions there was a delay in 
the money being moved on  so the point of loss for these payments was Ms Ws crypto 
account, and not NatWest.
I have also considered if NatWest could have done anything to recover the funds that Ms W 
has lost  but I dont think that it this would ever have been possible. The funds had already 
been paid to the scammer, and had already been lost, so there was nothing that could be 
done to recover the funds. 
I am very sorry to hear of the experience Ms W has been through  she has been the victim 
of a cruel and sophisticated scam  and I understand that she will be feeling vulnerable and 
upset about what has happened. I in no way blame her for being taken in by a calculating 
scammer. But the loss she has experienced has been caused by the scammers themselves, not 
NatWest. And Im not able to uphold her complaint when I am not persuaded that further 
intervention could have stopped the scam. 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 January 2024.
