K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that the sum he was required  to pay Santander Consumer (UK) Plc 
(Santander), when  he settled his conditional  sale (CS)  agreement with it early,  was more  
than it should  have been. The rate of interest  was quoted  as being 5.31% (flat) and 
9.9% (APR). The flat rate is applied to the original sum borrowed and doesnt take into 
account repayments whereas the APR does.
background
Mr B took out a CS agreement with Santander  in July 2016 for £49,998,  repayable at 
£816.59 a month for 84 months.
Between August 2016 and May 2018 Mr B made a number of payments to his CS 
agreement totalling  £34,236.53.
In June 2018 Mr B settled  his CS agreement  with Santander early  by paying the sum 
requested of £23,022.48.
Mr B complained to Santander to say that he believed that the sum requested  of him of 
£23,022.48, and which he had paid,  was more than it should have been.
Santander responded to Mr B to say that the sum it had requested of £23,022.48 was 
correct. 
Mr B didnt agree with Santanders calculations saying that he believed  he was due a refund.
Mr Bs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded  that Santander 
had done nothing wrong. 
Mr B didnt agree with the investigators conclusion. He believed he was due a refund.  In 
support of his view,  Mr B provided a number of calculations.
The investigator wasnt persuaded  to change his mind so Mr Bs complaint was passed  to 
me for review and decision.
I issued two provisional decisions on this case, one in August 2019  and one in 
September 2019. In my second provisional  decision dated September 2019 I said, in 
summary:
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The amount  of a CS agreement payment is composed of a combination of interest 
and principal. Over the life of the CS agreement, the proportion of interest to principal  
will change.  Initially a consumers payment  will be primarily  interest,  with a small 
amount of principal included. As the CS agreement  progresses, the principal portion 
of the payment will increase and the interest  portion of the payment will decrease.  
This is because interest is based  on the current outstanding  balance  of the CS 
agreement, at the relevant point  in time,  which  decreases as more  principal is paid.
Ref: DRN18156792Had Mr Bs CS agreement run its full term, with him making all of the payments 
required of him (at the required time) he would have made 84 payments totalling 
£68,593.56  made  up of the £49,998 original advance plus £18,595.56 in interest.  
It can be seen from [a statement provided]  that between  August 2016 and June 2018 
Mr B paid Santander £57,259.01 made up of the £49,998 original advance and 
£7,261.01 in interest.
Ive reconstructed Mr Bs CS agreement (based on the actual payments he made) on 
the same  mathematical  basis as he applied in the calculations provided in response  
to the investigators  view.
[This reconstruction]  shows  that by making the payments he did Mr B paid Santander  
£422.37 (say £430) more than was due and owing under  his CS agreement (based 
on no additional interest for early settlement being  applied and calculating interest on 
a monthly basis based on the previous months balance).
However on early settlement Santander  was entitled to charge Mr B a further  58 days  
interest. This right derives from the Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations 
2004.
Based on interest  accruing and charged  to Mr Bs CS agreement of £183.42  for 
May 2018this equates  to approximately £350.  If this sum of £350 is deducted from 
the overpayment  of £430 this leaves a net overpayment  of £80. Even  allowing  for the 
fact that [my reconstruction] includes a small degree of interest overcharging 
(because payments  made are treated as being made at the end of each month, 
rather than the actual day they were  paid)  Im of the view that Santanders calculation 
that Mr B is due no refund to be accurate in all material respects.
Ive considered very carefully the calculations provided by Mr B.
In [one calculation]  Mr B assumes that what Santander should have charged  him by 
way of interest was 5.31%  on £49,998 reducing  over time. 
In [another  calculation]  Mr B assumes  that what Santander charged him by way of 
interest was 5.31% on £68,593.56 (£49,998  capital  plus £18,595.56 interest) 
reducing over time - so involving a degree  of interest  on interest.
But both calculations are incorrect.  As I understand it what  Santander charged Mr B 
on his CS agreement, and correctly so, was 9.9%  on £49,998 reducing over time with 
no interest on interest being  charged.
So by way of example  what  Mr B was charged  in August 2016 was approximately  
£395 @ 9.9% on £49,998 and not £221.24  @ 5.31% on £49,998  or £303.53  
@ 5.31%  on £68,593.56.  What Mr B was charged  in August 2017 was approximately  
£310 @ 9.9% on an approximate balance of £39,800 and not £167.47 on £37,846.86 
or £254.23 on £57,453.46.
Ref: DRN18156793Mr B is wrong in his assumption that what Santander  should have charged him by 
way of interest was 5.31%  on £49,998 reducing  over time. The correct  rate to apply 
here isnt 5.31% but the APR rate of 9.9%. Using an incorrect interest rate of 5.31% 
overestimates how quickly  the loan reduces over time, whether overpayments  are 
made or not.
Mr B calculates that between August  2016  and May 2018 he should  have been 
charged £3,657  in interest. This might be correct at an interest rate of 5.31%, but 
applying the correct rate of 9.9% (over the same period) equates to a sum closer to 
£6,700.
The flat rate of 5.31%  is to be applied,  when calculating  interest  payable,  not on a 
reducing balance  basis, but on the original sum advanced. So in this case 5.31% x 
£49,998 x 7 years = £18,584.26,  the same (allowing for rounding)  as 9.9% APR on a 
reducing balance  totalling £18,595.56.
Given what I say above Im satisfied that Santander has done  nothing wrong in the 
case and it need  not pay Mr B anything by way of compensation.
Santander responded to say it had nothing further  to add.
Mr B responded to say that he still believed  he was due a refund from Santander, but 
provided nothing  materially new for my consideration.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that Santander says it has nothing further to add and given that Mr B has 
provided nothing  materially new for my consideration  I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional findings and I now confirm them as final. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 November  2019.
