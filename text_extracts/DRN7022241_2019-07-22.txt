K820x#14complaint
Ms D complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid)  was irresponsible  to lend 
to her.

Payment Plan
* Largest scheduled monthly repayment over the term of the loan
Ms D says she was stuck in a lending cycle and was using one loan to repay another.  She 
says the loans increased in value and she wasnt asked for proof of her income. As a result, 
Ms D says she was incurring bank charges as well as paying interest on the loans and 
ended up having  to borrow from friends and family.
QuickQuid says Ms Ds pattern of borrowing did not indicate she was dependent on the 
loans and it wasnt notified of any financial difficulties until a few months  after taking out 
loan 4. It says Ms D confirmed the loans were affordable when applying and that it also 
checked her credit record. QuickQuid says it also arranged  a repayment plan for loan 4 to 
enable Ms D to repay the balance. It also offered to refund  the interest and charges on loan 
4 (plus 8% statutory interest) as a goodwill  gesture.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She found the repayment on 
the loan 2 top-up was a significant proportion of Ms Ds income  and thought it unlikely shed 
be able to sustainably  meet  this repayment   or those of any subsequent loans. She 
recommended QuickQuid should refund interest  and charges  on the loan 2 top-up to loan 4 
(plus 8% statutory interest) and that it should remove any associated negative  information 
from her credit file.
QuickQuid responded  to say, in summary, that it didnt agree the lending was unsustainable  
as no evidence regarding  the individual circumstances of each loan had been presented.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN70222412QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms D 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Ms D could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ds complaint.
Ive looked at the circumstances  of all four loans and I dont consider QuickQuids checks 
went far enough for any of them. I say that because Ms D had declared her income to be 
£965 per month and, in all the loan applications, the scheduled repayment was a large  
proportion of this. In addition, Ms D had various  repayment issues  with each loan. As a 
minimum, I think QuickQuid should  have asked Ms D about her monthly expenditure and, 
from the loan 2 top-up I think it should have  carried out a full financial review before 
approving further  lending.
Ref: DRN70222413As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for the loan 2 top-up onwards would 
most likely have shown  that Ms D:
Could  not sustainably make the scheduled repayments:
oThe repayments for the loans represented  a significant proportion of Ms Ds 
income;
oBy the top-up for loan 2, Ms D had already shown signs  that she was 
struggling to repay the previous loans;
Was borrowing again to repay  previous loans:
oLoans 3 and 4 were  taken out the same day Ms D had repaid loans 2 and 3 
respectively;
Had difficulty managing her money.
So, I dont think QuickQuid should have approved the loan 2 top-up, or subsequent loans.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) 
should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Ms D paid on the loan 2 top-up, loan 3 and loan 
4;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about the loan 2 top-up, loan 3 and loan 4 from 
Ms Ds credit  file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Ms D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 August 2019.
