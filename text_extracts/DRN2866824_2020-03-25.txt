* The highest  repayment figure is sometimes made  up of multiple  payments when the 
loans overlapped.
There was a gap in lending between the time Mr B paid back  loan 2 and when he took out 
loan 3 of around  seven  months. I have therefore  looked at this as two separate chains of 
lending.
Mr B told us that he had multiple payday loans  with other lenders and had resorted to using 
these loans to make payments towards his pre-existing  credit commitments, demonstrating  
his long-term reliance on this short-term  lending. He also said there were no reasonable 
circumstances in which Sunny could have  considered the loans as affordable and often had 
to fall back on an overdraft facility. If Sunny had referred to Mr Bs credit  report it would have 
been aware of his reliance on borrowing.
In its final response Sunny told Mr B it did not uphold his complaint. It said for all loans it 
undertook eligibility,  creditworthiness  and affordability checks before making a decision  
whether to lend.  Its records showed that it had carried out the assessments correctly and the 
amounts advanced  were  assessed as being affordable over the term of each loan.
Ref: DRN28668242Our adjudicator said he hadnt seen enough to uphold  loans  1-7 but he said loans  8-16 
shouldnt have been provided. At this time Mr Bs overall pattern of borrowing  suggested  he 
had become persistently reliant on short-  term loans.  He said Mr B had taken out six loans in 
around four months and the amounts he was borrowing was generally  increasing over this 
time. Sunny disagreed  with this view but said as a gesture of goodwill it would write off Mr 
Bs outstanding balance  of £313.53 for loans 15 and 16. Mr B didnt accept this offer.
Another adjudicator  looked again  at the complaint and this time he said he didnt  think  Sunny 
should have given Mr B loan 5 onwards. He said the information Sunny gathered wouldve 
shown that Mr B was having problems managing money. At the point Sunny gave Mr B loan 
5 hed declared his income to be £1,321.67 and his expenditure to be £1,062  per month.  He 
didnt think the amount  Mr B was left with after paying his outstanding repayments  was a 
reasonable amount.
 As the parties are not in agreement the complaint  was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN28668243Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. I agree with our second  adjudicators  
view that this complaint  should be upheld from loan 5 onwards. I will explain why.
There was a gap in lending when Mr B paid off loan 2 and took out loan 3, and I have 
considered this as two separate chains of borrowing,  so, I dont think  I can fairly say Sunny 
did anything wrong  when it gave Mr B his first four loans. This was early  on in the lending  
relationship with Sunny and I think the checks Sunny did were  proportionate and probably 
wouldnt have indicated  that the loans  were unaffordable.
But by the time Mr B took out loan 5 Mr B had declared his income  as £1,321.67 and his 
expenditure as £1,062.00. Considering the repayments Mr B had to make which included the 
repayments for loan 4, which  was still outstanding,  together  with the repayment  for loan 5, as 
well as having to make these repayments  over an extended period, Mr B would have been 
left with very little with which  to repay  any unforeseen or unexpected expenses. I think  at this 
time Sunny should have realised that it was unlikely Mr B could have sustainably been  able 
to repay  this loan and any subsequent  loan.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr B, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
8. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr B was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Taking  into account the gap in lending  this was the sixth loan within 
around four months and Mr B had been  indebted to Sunny for all that time. Mr B had 
only just repaid loan 7 which  was for £600   the highest amount he had borrowed so 
far and within  3 days he took out loan 8. I think by this time Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mr B was having to borrow further  to cover the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Bs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Bs first loan was for £200.00 and loan 8 was also for £200.00 but as I said above  
there had only been  three days before taking out loan 8 and repaying  loan 7 which  
was for £600.00. At this point Sunny  ought to have  known that Mr B was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 8 onwards  Mr B was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of settling a 
previous one. I also note that loan 11 was repaid on the same  day as he took out 
loans 12 and 13. Both these  loans were repaid on the same  day he took them out.
Ref: DRN28668244Mr B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 16 was 
taken out ten months after Mr Bs first loan in this chain of borrowing and around 17 
months since he started a lending  relationship  with Sunny. And it although it was for 
a smaller amount of £150.00,  he still had to repay loan 15 at that time and both loans 
are still outstanding. Mr B had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr B lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 8 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr B borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Bs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5-7 and loans 8 onwards and Sunny should  
put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr B loans 5-16.
I understand that Mr B still has loans 15 and 16 outstanding. If Sunny has sold the 
outstanding debts to a third party, it should buy these back if it is able to do so and then take 
the following  steps.
If Sunny is not able to buy the debt back, then it should liaise with the new debt owner to 
achieve the results  outlined  below.
A)Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Mr B towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything  you have already  refunded.
B)Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual payments made by Mr B 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr B originally made 
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C)Sunny  should  remove all interest,  fees and charges  from the balance  on any upheld 
outstanding loans and treat any repayments  made by Mr B as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr B having 
made overpayments  then it should  refund these  overpayments  with 8% simple  
interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments  would 
have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Sunny  should  then refund  the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step E.
D)If there  is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts  calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans and any 
principal Sunny has already written-off.  If this results in a surplus,  then the surplus 
should be paid to Mr B. However,  if there is still an outstanding balance then Sunny 
Ref: DRN28668245should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr B. Sunny shouldnt pursue  
outstanding balances made  up of principal Sunny has already written-off.  
E)Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  recorded on Mr Bs credit  file in 
relation to loans  5-7. The overall pattern of Mr Bs borrowing for loans 8 onwards 
means any information recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove  
these loans entirely from Mr Bs credit  file. Sunny does not have to remove  loans 15 
and 16 from Mr Bs credit file until these have  been repaid, but you should still 
remove any adverse information  recorded  about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mr B a certificate  showing  how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Bs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2020.
