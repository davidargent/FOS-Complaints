K821x#15complaint
Miss N complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid lent to her irresponsibly 
in 2015. 
background
I attach my provisional decision dated 20 August  2019, which forms part of this final decision 
and should be read with it. In it I explained why I intended to uphold  Miss Ns complaint in 
part. Both parties were  given time to provide  any further comments they may have by 
3 September 2019 before  I reached  a further  decision.
Miss N was sent the provisional decision and has not replied. QuickQuid has made  some  
points and disagrees with the provisional  decision.  
The reply  date for sending  me further  points  has passed and so its fair that I finalise my 
decision. 
my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
I have considered QuickQuids points. But, in my view, QuickQuid put forward nothing  new.  
So I do not alter the findings in my provisional  decision. 
I uphold Miss Ns complaint for Loan 3. 
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
QuickQuid has said that Miss N didnt fully repay  loan 3. Miss Ns 2018 personal credit file 
shows that QuickQuid  still owns the debt. So it should remove all interest  and charges from 
loan 3 and treat any payments made as if they were payments  towards the principal. There  
may still be a sum outstanding. If there is then repayment of the balance  of the principal 
amount will need  to be arranged bearing  in mind QuickQuids obligation to treat Miss Ns 
debt in a positive and sympathetic way. 
Once the debt has been  repaid,  QuickQuid will need to remove  any negative repayment 
information for Loan 3 from Miss Ns credit  file. 
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Miss N a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Ns complaint in part and direct  that CashEuroNet UK 
LLC, trading as QuickQuid, does  as I have outlined above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss N to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 October  2019.

Loan 1 was due on 26 May and repaid on 28 April 2015.
Loan 2s first repayment  was due 26 May and the second on 26 June 2015.
Loan 3s first repayment  was due 25 June and second on 24 July 2015.
Miss N informed QuickQuid  by telephone that she was in financial difficulty on 24 June 2015. She 
explained that she would  be using a third party to administer a debt management programme (DMP). 
QuickQuid charged her a late fee on 30 June 2015 and Miss N queried it at the time.  
In its final response letter emailed to Miss N in March  2018, QuickQuid mentioned that Miss N had 
told it she was in financial  difficulty  on 24 June  2015.  QuickQuid did make an offer in relation to 
Loan 3. This was to waive a late fees charge  of £15 on 29 June 2015.  After interest  and less tax it 
came to £17.42. Miss N seems to have rejected this and brought her complaint here to this service. 
One of our adjudicators  looked  at this complaint and thought  that QuickQuid had done nothing wrong.  
Miss N did not agree  and said that she had too much unsecured loan debt at the time for the loans to 
have been lent responsibly. She has asked  for an ombudsman to review the complaint.
QuickQuid sent submissions, details  of the loans  and a copy of its thirteen page lending document  
which outlines  its 2015 affordability review and its procedures in place from 1 March 2015. 
The complaint remained unresolved and was passed to me. 
my provisional  findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide  what  I consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general  approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry  
practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Miss N could repay  the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
Ref: DRN61561874But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish whether  
Miss N could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being  without undue  
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting  
other reasonable  commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower 
wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their 
repayments without borrowing further.  QuickQuid has made extensive submissions about its 
affordability review and the procedures it undertook from 1 March 2015. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Miss Ns complaint.
Miss N sent to us her personal credit  file dated August 2018 and so it covers the years going back to 
August 2012.  And she has sent us bank statements  for the period 22 November  2014 to November 
2015. 
The proportionate checks I would  have  expected QuickQuid  to have had at the time Miss N applied 
for Loan 1 would have been her income but not necessarily details of any short  term loans she may 
have had at that time. I say this because Miss N would  have been a new customer and was asking for 
a £150 loan.  
I do not think  that QuickQuid  had a record of her income in April 2015 but it has shown me a record of 
25 April 2015 that Miss N told QuickQuid her outgoings were £1,125. 
QuickQuid has explained  that its credit search reports would have gauged the accuracy of Miss Ns 
income. I can see from her statements that this was about £1,800 a month.  So I think  that for Loan 1 
QuickQuid likely would have assessed it as being affordable.  
I say the same for Loan 2 as her second loan was for £150 with declared expenditure  of £1,125 plus 
the income QuickQuid  likely  would have verified  as being around £1,800 then I do not think  that 
QuickQuid is likely to have  considered it unaffordable. Miss N had repaid  the first loan quickly 
incurring just £3.60 interest  and so from QuickQuids perspective  I do not think  its likely  to have had a 
concern.
So I am not planning to uphold Loans 1 and 2. 
Ref: DRN61561875By 3 June 2015 when Miss N returned for Loan 3, I think that the position had changed. Miss N had 
declared a higher salary of £3,057 and it had her declared expenditure  of £1,125. Miss N was asking 
for her third loan in just over 5 weeks and it was for a figure almost four times her previous  loan. So 
I think  that QuickQuid  ought to have done some additional checks  to see if she was managing  her 
money properly in early June 2015. I know that it carried out some credit checks  but I have not 
received those results.  
As this is a provisional decision, if QuickQuid wishes to demonstrate  further information  it may have 
had at the time of Miss Ns lending then it has the opportunity  to send to me the complete set of the 
credit search  results. 
So using the information I have  from Miss Ns personal  credit file and her bank statements I am able 
to see that by this time Miss N had taken a short term loan with another provider for £500 on 
6 May 2015. This was the latest in a series of loans from that particular lender and I can see she 
repaid this early on 15 May 2015. So it was not outstanding as at 3 June  2015 when Miss N applied 
for Loan 3, but it is another example I have seen of Miss N borrowing  to repay  other  borrowing which 
is a clear sign of unsustainable lending.
By early June 2015 Miss N had at least these outstanding and longer term loans (maybe more): one 
long term high-cost loan with monthly repayments of about £216; another high-cost long term loan 
with monthly repayments of about £115, and another with repayments each month of about  £288.  
Miss N also had taken two instalment loans for £900 and £1,000 which  meant monthly  repayments of 
£294 and £158. And on 15 May 2015 Miss N had taken another loan with further monthly repayments 
of £212. All these came  to £1,283 a month. 
In the circumstances,  I think that a responsible lender  would  have been able to know from her huge 
increase in short  term lending and the associated ongoing monthly repayments that Miss N was not 
managing her money and as such I think that the large  loan application for Loan 3 was not lent 
responsibly. 
I am planning  to uphold Miss Ns complaint  for Loan 3.
