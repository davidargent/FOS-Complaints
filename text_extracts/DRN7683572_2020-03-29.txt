Ms F says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny, irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about eight loans Sunny provided  to Ms F between September 2017  and 
October 2017. Ms Fs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Repayment
1 08/09/2017 22/09/2017 6 £100.00 £30.00
2 09/09/2017 03/10/2017 6 £100.00 £59.72
3 12/09/2017 07/10/2017 6 £100.00 £88.82
4 19/09/2017 03/10/2017 6 £100.00 £122.15
5 29/09/2017 01/10/2017 6 £300.00 £188.20
6 01/10/2017 23/03/2018 6 £500.00 £250.08
7 03/10/2017 23/03/2018 6 £250.00 £264.36
8 07/10/2017 23/01/2018 6 £100.00 £265.56
Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Fs complaint about loans 4 onwards  and thought these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms F could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN76835722There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms F could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Fs complaint.  Our adjudicators  both felt that loans 1, 
2 and 3 should not be upheld, Ms F appears  to have agreed with this. So as these  loans are 
no longer in dispute, I havent considered these further in my decision. But I have looked at 
all of Ms Fs loans when considering her overall  lending history with Sunny. 
Sunny agreed  to uphold Ms Fs complaint  about loans 7 and 8. So, I havent considered 
these loans either - but I have included these  in the section below outlining  what Sunny 
should do to put things  right. 
Sunny said it carried out income and expenditure checks and inquired about Ms Fs other 
short-term credit obligations before lending her any of these loans. However, at the time 
Ms F was applying for loan 4, she still had loans 1  3 outstanding with Sunny and had also 
taken out these three loans within the space  of a few days. So, she was already £300 in debt 
to Sunny in one month and was requesting  another  £100. Ive also seen that although Ms F 
declared a monthly  income of £1,400 for all of her loans, her declared monthly expenditure 
for loans  1,2, and 3 were all different  and the loans  had all been taken out within a few 
days of each other. So overall,  I think these factors warranted more thorough checks  of 
Ms Fs circumstances.   
The fact that the forth loan was taken 11 days after loan 1, ought to have  alerted Sunny  to 
the possibility  that Ms F might have  been  having  problems  managing  her money.  And the 
application for Loan 4 was made against the earlier lending  background. A proportionate 
check for Loans 4 and 5 at this stage  of the lending  relationship would have been a review of 
the whole  of Ms Fs financial position, including verification  of income, outgoings,  regular 
commitments and other short-term lending  decisions. Had this have been completed 
correctly it wouldve most  likely  have  shown that Ms F had a number of short-term  loans with 
other providers at this time and was also consistently overdrawn on her bank account.  In 
these circumstances,  I think  it was unlikely Ms F wouldve been able to sustainably repay 
this and any subsequent loans. So, I dont  think Sunny shouldve lent Ms F loans 4 and 5 on 
this basis.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Ms F, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
Ref: DRN76835723was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Fs case, and in agreement with the first 
adjudicator who considered  this case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say this 
because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Ms F was not managing  to repay  her loans  
sustainably. Ms F had taken out five loans within three  weeks and Ms F had 
requested loan 6 on the same day as she paid off loan 5. So Sunny ought to have  
realised it was more likely  than not Ms F was having to borrow further  to cover the 
hole repaying  her previous loans were leaving in her finances and that Ms Fs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ms Fs first loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £500. At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that Ms F was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in their 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From  the start of Ms Fs lending chain with Sunny,  she was provided  with a new loan 
either before paying off the previous loan, or on the same  day as paying off a 
previous loan.  
I think that Ms F lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Fs indebtedness by allowing  her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans Ms F borrowed was likely to have had negative  implications on 
her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market  for these high-
cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 onwards and Sunny should put things 
right as set out below.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms F paid on loans 4 - 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Ms Fs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6, 7 and 8 should  be removed from 
Ms Fs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Ms F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN76835724my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Fs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 April 2020.
