K821x#15complaint
Ms M complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid and as Pounds to Pocket  
(CEU) was irresponsible  to approve the loans she applied for. 
background
CEU approved three loans for Ms M in 2017 and a summary appears here.
LoanDate  of loanType PrincipalMax 
instalment Date Repaid
1 11/08/2017 Payday £50.00 £65.20 18/09/2017
2 05/10/2017 Payday £150.00 £196.80 13/11/2017
3 16/11/2017 Instalment £900.00 £129.95 outstanding
One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint and decided  that CEU should put things 
right in relation  to Loan 2. He thought  that the checks CEU ought to have  carried out were 
done and they were  proportionate. Ms M had declared her expenditure as £925 when she 
applied for Loan  2, and as CEU had a record that her income  was £1,130,  subtracting  one 
from the other would  have  left her with £205.  The repayment for Loan 2 was around £197 
and so Ms M would have  had less than £10 left over. He did not think that this was sufficient 
and upheld the complaint  in relation to Loan 2.
Ms M is represented by a third party. Neither  Ms M nor her representative disputed the 
adjudicators view and so I take it that Ms M has no issue with the outcome for 
Loans 1 and 3. And when informed that the matter  was being passed to an ombudsman 
Ms Ms CMC had until 19 January 2019  to make any further comments  and none has been 
received. So I do not plan to review Loans  1 and 3.
CEU disputed our adjudicators opinion in relation to Loan 2. It sent to us the thirteen page 
document relating to its affordability review for loans approved  post-March 2015. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner 
without it adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. The 
key element was that any checks needed  to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different  things,  including how much was being lent and when  the sum being  
borrowed was due to be repaid. 
I would have expected CEU to have known about Ms Ms income  and her outgoings  and 
regular financial expenditure. It had this information  and so I consider that the checks  it 
carried out were proportionate. This was the second  payday  loan.  
Ref: DRN67807782CEUs records show that Ms M had told it her income was £1,130 and her expenses were  
£925 which was a £600 increase on her expenditure declaration  in August 2017  just two 
months earlier. The loan repayment was going  to be just under £197 on 13 November 2017. 
CEU has told us that it calculated Ms Ms estimated disposable income (EDI) as £199.75. 
Its not entirely clear  how it arrived at that figure, but this is a very similar to the straight 
subtraction of expenditure from income  - £205   and so I do not think I need to say much 
more about how the EDI figure  was reached. With a repayment of £197 then on CEUs EDI 
figure Ms M would have been  left with £2 and with our calculations  - about  £8.
My view is that either sum (£2 or £8) is too narrow a margin.  In my capacity as the 
ombudsman looking at Loan 2 from a fair and reasonable perspective,  I uphold  Ms Ms 
complaint for Loan 2. I think  CEU should do as follows:
refund  any interest and charges  already  paid by Ms M for Loan  2;
apply 8% simple interest  per year to any interest  and charges refunded from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse payment information  about  Loan 2 from Ms Ms credit file.
CEU is entitled to set off any monies arising  from the redress against any monies Ms M may 
owe it. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CEU to take off tax from this interest and it must give 
Ms M a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Ms complaint in part and direct that CashEuroNet  UK 
LLC does as I have  outlined above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Ms M to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 April 2019.
