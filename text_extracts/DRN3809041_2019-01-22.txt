K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains that NewDay Ltd has harassed  him for a credit card debt hes unable  to 
repay and refused to accept £50 a month. Mr B also complains that NewDay has called at 
unreasonable times. 
background
Mr B has a credit card with NewDay. In July 2018 Mr B told NewDay hed been made 
unemployed and that he couldnt  afford to maintain his monthly payment. 
In the months  that followed Mr B made payments to his credit card but wasnt  able to pay the 
full amount so his account went into arrears. NewDay  asked Mr B to complete an income 
and expenditure  assessment during this time but when it was returned it wasnt  complete 
because he didnt say how much he owed to other creditors. Subsequent income and 
expenditure forms havent included an income figure. 
As a result no payment arrangement was agreed  by NewDay and interest continued to 
accrue on Mr Bs account. Mr B complained but NewDay didnt agree it had made an error 
when dealing with his credit card. Mr B went on to refer his complaint to this service and an 
investigator looked at what  had happened. 
The investigator didnt  think NewDay had treated Mr B unfairly by refusing to put a payment 
plan in place.  But they thought the calls to Mr B after NewDay  said it had suspended 
collections activity werent fair and asked it to pay £50. T
The investigator arranged  for another income  and expenditure assessment to be completed  
and also liaised with NewDay. While  a formal payment plan hasnt been agreed because  
Mr B doesnt  have enough  disposable  income, NewDay  has accepted £50 payments and 
agreed to put the account on hold until April 2019.  
Mr B remains unhappy with the way NewDays handled his complaint and asked for his case  
to be appealed so its been  passed to me to make  a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im going  to begin by looking at how NewDays contacted Mr B in relation to his credit  card.  I 
appreciate Mr B feels hes been  harassed but Ive not found NewDay  has acted 
unreasonably here.  As Mr B didnt  provide  completed income an expenditure assessments 
NewDay wasnt able to agree a payment plan.  
In the absence of a payment plan I think its reasonable  for a lender to contact a borrower 
about how the debt will be repaid.  Ive not found NewDay called Mr B too often or that the 
times it called at were  unreasonable.  
Lenders ask for income and expenditure assessments  to be completed  in order to ensure 
any payment arrangements agreed  are affordable.  In this case, I think NewDays  been 
consistent in trying to get the information it needed from Mr B in order to see whether a 
payment plan could  be arranged. 
Ref: DRN38090412I say this because  its asked Mr B to complete  income and expenditure assessments on a 
number of occasions and information  has been  missing when theyve been returned. Mr B 
didnt originally give details about  what he owed to other credit  card providers and later didnt 
provide an income  figure. I appreciate Mr B isnt working  but he didnt confirm whether he 
was receiving benefits or income from another source and thats information I think NewDay  
was entitled to ask for. 
Since the complaints  been referred  to this service the investigator obtained a completed  
income and expenditure assessment from Mr B and passed it over to NewDay. I understand 
agreeing a formal  payment plan hasnt  been  possible  because Mr Bs outgoings are higher 
than his income. But NewDays confirmed its put collections  activity on hold until April 2019 
to give him more time to address the situation. And I think  thats fair in the circumstances. 
NewDays explained that it will look to complete  another income and expenditure 
assessment with Mr B in April 2019 to help decide  what action to take next. Mr B should be 
aware that if he remains unable to afford  to start payments again NewDay may take the 
decision to start action to recover  the debt. 
NewDay said it would stop contacting  Mr B about  the debt but it continued to call him. 
NewDays agreed to pay £50 for the service provided and I think that fairly reflects the 
impact on Mr B. 
Im satisfied NewDay has dealt with Mr Bs complaint fairly. Its agreed to pay £50 for 
contacting him after it had agreed  not to. Despite being unable to agree a formal payment 
plan NewDays agreed to accept £50 a month  until April 2019 and suspended interest and 
charges until that time. As Im satisfied NewDays agreement to pay £50 and accept 
payments of £50 a month until April 2019  is fair Im not telling it to do anything else. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part and that NewDay  Ltd should  pay Mr B £50. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 February  2019.
