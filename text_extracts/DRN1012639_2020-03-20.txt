* The highest monthly repayment is the payment  required from the consumer  in any given 
month to include contractual payment of outstanding loans as well as the contractual  
payment on the current loan.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ts complaint and thought loans 6 and 7 shouldnt have been 
given to Mr T. This was because the pattern of lending suggested Mr T had become reliant 
on short  term loans. She didnt think Sunny needed to do more with loans  8 onwards as 
there was a significant break in between  loans 7 and 8.
Sunny didnt agree with this and said it carried out proportionate checks  and Mr Ts pattern  
of borrowing  didnt raise  any concerns. 
As an agreement couldnt  be reached the case was passed to me  an ombudsman  to reach 
a final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr T could 
Ref: DRN10126392repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,  
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending  itself 
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might  be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this 
is the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without 
undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on 
time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to 
meet the repayments. And it follows  that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments  without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to more when it approved  loans 1 to 5 and loans 
8 to 11. Mr T didnt  disagree with the adjudicators  opinion about these loans so I wont be 
making further findings on them  although  I will consider  them when looking at Mr Ts overall  
financial situation.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr T, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ts case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan
6. I say this because:
Ref: DRN10126393At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr T was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr T had taken out 6 loans within 2 months. Sunny says it carried  out 
checks and Mr T had sufficient disposable  income. However, the repayments for loan 
7 meant  Mr T was only left with a disposable  income of £70. This and the number of 
loans Mr T had taken means Sunny ought to have  realised it was more likely than not 
Mr T was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was 
leaving in his finances. This in turn meant  that Mr Ts indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably. 
Mr Ts first loan was for £500 and loan 6 was for £350. The amounts  in-between  
dropped down for loan 2 but by loan 6 they had been steadily increasing again.  
Some of Mr Ts debts  were also overlapping. And Mr T often took out a new loan as 
soon as one had been repaid.  At this point Sunny ought to have known that Mr T was 
not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in his income but to meet an 
ongoing need.
Mr T was also given  loans 6 and 7 whilst  he had an existing loan running with Sunny. 
Sunny says it allows customers to have  to have a maximum  of four loans up to a 
certain credit limit. But this still means  Mr T had increased his borrowing and monthly 
outgoings and there was no indication  his reliance on short term credit was coming  to 
an end.
Sunny  also says Mr T settled loans  early, which means he wasnt in financial 
hardship. But I dont  think this means Mr T was managing his finances effectively, 
and often early settlement of a loan can be an indication of issues with debt 
management.
I think that Mr T lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  for loans 6 and 7 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him
to take expensive credit intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely to
have had negative  implications on Mr Ts ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 and 7 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr T loans 6 and 7.
A.)Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Mr T towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans,  including payments made to a third party  
where applicable, but not including anything it has already  refunded.
B.)Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual payment made by Mr T 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr T originally made 
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C.)Sunny  should  pay Mr T the total of A plus B.
Ref: DRN10126394D.)The overall pattern  of Mr T borrowing for loan 6 and 7 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove  these loans entirely from 
Mr Ts credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  Sunny  to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny should  give Mr T a 
certificate showing  how much tax its deducted,  if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ts complaint. Elevate Credit
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 April 2020.
