The complaint
Mrs F complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) restricted her account, withheld 
money in it for an excessive period, and provided poor customer service. 
As a result, Mrs F wants PayPal to pay her compensation for the significant distress and 
inconvenience it caused.  
What happened
In May 2019, PayPal reviewed Mrs Fs account, restricted her access to it and ultimately 
withheld around £145 in it. PayPal notified Mrs F by email of its decision, amongst other 
things it said: 
"As per the User Agreement, when PayPal places a permanent limitation on an account due 
to an Acceptable Use Policy violation, any funds in your account will be held for 180 days. 
After 180 days, if applicable, we'll contact you with information on how to withdraw any 
money from your PayPal account"
Mrs F contacted PayPal in November 2019 to access her funds - this would have been 
around 180 days after it had decided to hold the funds. PayPal asked Mrs F to provide it with 
identity and address proof. Mrs F says she did this via her PayPal account  PayPal say it 
hadnt received anything. 
Mrs F then complained in July 2020 as she still hadnt received her funds. She says she was 
met with the same standard message to confirm her identity. PayPal say Mrs F sent her 
proof of identity to an unmonitored email in August 2020 instead of uploading it onto her 
account. As a result, it wasnt picked up causing further delay. 
Mrs F then complained and later referred the matter to this service in March 2021. 
PayPal contacted Mrs F in April 2021 to say she could withdraw her funds. Mrs F said she 
still wanted to proceed with her complaint about PayPals lack of customer care and 
unresponsiveness to her complaint. And, that PayPal should not have held onto her money 
for as long as it did. 
One of our Investigators looked into Mrs Fs complaint. In summary they found: 
- PayPal reviewed Mrs Fs account in line with its obligations and terms of account. 
And it isnt obliged to give any notice or explanation for doing so
- Theres no evidence to support Mrs Fs assertion she uploaded the required 
documents in November 2019. But based on Mrs Fs testimony and emails provided, 
her account of what happened is both plausible and persuasive. Because of this 
PayPal ought to have been much more proactive in resolving the issue 
- So, because of this PayPal should pay Mrs F £100 for the poor customer service in 
relation to releasing the funds. 
PayPal agreed with our Investigators recommendations, but Mrs F has said the 
compensation award isnt a fair amount. Some of the key things shes said in response are: 
 
- The award should be somewhere between £300 and £750 based on what the 
services website says about considerable distress and upset  specifically where 
theres been significant inconvenience and disruption which requires a lot of effort to 
sort out
- She had complied with PayPals request to upload identification proof, but it still took 
almost two years to release her money  
- The level of compensation shouldnt depend on the amount of money involved, but it 
should be based on the failings of PayPal and how long the matter has taken to 
resolve
- Though the amount held by PayPal was around £145, its still a decent amount which 
wouldve helped with paying bills or have earned interest 
- PayPal couldnt be bothered to answer Mrs Fs complaint despite several attempts. 
This forced her to refer her complaint this service
As Mrs F doesnt agree with what our Investigator said, the complaint has now been passed 
to me to decide. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
Financial businesses in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to 
meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means regulated firms need 
to restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
Ive closely reviewed PayPals terms - which includes its Acceptable Use Policy. Given the 
legal and regulatory obligations placed on PayPal, and what its terms say, Im satisfied it 
acted fairly when deciding to review and then restrict Mrs Fs account.
PayPals terms say it can block an account and/or hold any funds in the reserve account for 
more than 180 days if required. By holding onto Mrs Fs funds for 180 days from when the
initial limitation was placed, Im persuaded PayPal acted in line with the terms of the
account.
Im also persuaded this action was proportionate given PayPals concerns that initiated the 
review. To that end, Mrs F has alluded to wanting to know PayPals reasons for deciding to 
review and place a restriction on her account. Im not aware of any obligation that compels 
either PayPal, or myself, to disclose this reason.
PayPal say that when the 180-day period ended it asked Mrs F to provide it with proof of her
identity. Mrs F says she supplied it  but PayPal say it never got this from her. PayPal 
doesnt have any records to show it received this. Nor have I seen anything from Mrs F that 
shows conclusively she did send it. Where evidence is missing or inconclusive, I can make my decision on what I think is most 
likely to have happened  the balance of probabilities. Given the consistency of Mrs Fs 
testimony, and as Ive seen attempts from her to chase this matter up and make a complaint 
with no response from PayPal, Im persuaded she did attempt to send her documents in 
November 2019. However, I cant say what channel was used to send it. 
PayPal do agree Mrs F sent the required documents to it in August 2020, but that she had 
sent it to an unmonitored email address. Ive seen PayPals correspondence wording in 
relation to this matter, and it doesnt say anything about the channel Mrs F should have 
used. I also question why it let her reply to an email address which isnt monitored  and 
didnt, as it appears, say anything to her about this.  
So, Im satisfied PayPal hasnt done enough in trying to resolve the matter of returning 
Mrs Fs funds when it should have  and that it failed to provide an adequate level of service 
in doing so. 
As a result of PayPals failings, it withheld Mrs Fs funds for much longer than it should have. 
But it also caused her inconvenience in having to periodically complain about it and 
ultimately refer the complaint to this service. In its submissions, PayPal had said that during 
a large part of the period it held onto Mrs Fs funds it faced operational challenges due to the 
pandemic. But I still think it could have done much more than it has. 
It now falls to me to determine what I think is fair compensation. In doing so, I will set my 
focus on the impact this has had on Mrs F in terms of any financial loss; and distress and 
inconvenience caused. 
I note Mrs F says this amount shouldnt be anchored or somewhat proportionally related on 
the amount of money PayPal was withholding. I think she is, to a large extent, right about 
this. But the amount is relevant as it determines how integral the funds were to Mrs F 
meeting her living costs. 
Mrs F says the amount would have helped her pay some of her bills. That may be true, but I 
havent seen anything that suggests she wasnt able to meet her bills or other key living 
costs. So I dont think the amount being withheld for as long as it was, has caused her 
substantive or considerable distress. 
The fact the money was withheld would no doubt have caused her worry, but Ive already 
said PayPal acted fairly in taking these actions. 
I do however think PayPals poor handling of the complaint and release of funds has caused 
Mrs F inconvenience. Its clear shes had to chase the matter up and has met with little or no 
response from PayPal on several occasions. I havent even seen a final response to Mrs Fs 
complaint. 
So, after weighing this up carefully, Im persuaded £100 is fair compensation for the 
inconvenience Mrs F has suffered. I also think this amount takes into account any loss of 
interest had Mrs F held the funds in a savings account. Ive considered what Mrs F says 
about the wording on our website, but Im satisfied this amount reflects a scenario where 
there have been repeated small errors which has required a reasonable effort to sort out.   
My final decision
Ive decided to uphold this complaint in part for the reasons explained above. I now direct 
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay Mrs F £100 in compensation. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 July 2022.
