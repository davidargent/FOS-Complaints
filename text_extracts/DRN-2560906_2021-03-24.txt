The complaint
Ms S complains that her payments to Nationwide Building Society (Nationwide) werent 
recorded accurately and her credit file was wrong.
What happened
Ms S had a credit card with Nationwide. She struggled with payments and the card account 
was defaulted. In December 2017, the balance was £2967 debit. In April 2019, the account 
was passed to a debt collection agency (DCA) to handle payments  although the debt 
stayed with Nationwide. Payments of £20 per month were being made. The balance when 
the debt was passed to the DCA was £2747.18 debit.
Ms S complained that all her payments werent credited to her balance and it was therefore 
wrong. In particular, she said that in April, she made two payments  one for £40, one for 
£20. But only £40 was shown. Therefore, her credit file was showing the wrong balance also.
Nationwide said they didnt have the call from April 2019 when Ms S said shed made the 
two payments of £40 and £20. Their records showed one payment of £40 and this is what 
was shown in her balance. But they said they didnt dispute what shed told them and made 
a goodwill payment of £50. As at September 2020, Ms S balance was £2407 debit. A 
balance of £2467 was showing on her credit file as at July 2020  this was accurate, as it 
was before three more payments of £20 had been made.  In October 2020, Nationwide 
wrote to Ms S again and said that the balances on Ms Ss account were consistent with her 
credit file  allowing for the fact that the credit file wasnt updated for a period.
Ms S brought her complaint to this service. Our investigator said hed looked at Ms S 
payments and theyd been credited to her account with Nationwide. Her credit file had been 
updated by them also in line with the balance outstanding. There was always a time lag up 
of up to eight weeks before theyre updated  so that can cause confusion.
Ms S asked that her complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms S has complained that the payments she made to Nationwide werent shown in her 
balance with them, and therefore her credit file is also wrong.
Let me say that the arrangement that Nationwide had with the DCA was that the DCA 
manage Ms S payments to her debt  but her debt stayed with Nationwide. And Ms S made 
payments into her Nationwide account (not the DCA), so that could have caused some 
confusion as to what happened. 
Ive looked at Ms S Nationwide account to see what happened.  On 26 April 2019, a balance 
of £2747.18 was owed to Nationwide  after a payment of £40 was credited on 16 April 
2019. This balance is also what was shown by the DCA when it took over Ms S account on 
26 April 2019. A further £340 was paid in between then and 28 September 2020  leaving a 
balance of £2407.18. In October 2020, Ms S credit file was showing a balance of £2447  
because the credit reference agencies (CRAs) updating their files later. And so the two 
payments of £20 made in August and September 2020 still werent shown at the CRAs. 
Ive looked at Ms S credit card statements  and they all show the payments of £20 per 
month being received from January 2019 to September 2020  apart from January 2019, 
April 2019 and September 2019  when £40 per month was paid.
So  Ms S payments were being received by Nationwide and shown at the CRAs.
Ms S says she paid £60 in April 2019, not £40  that is the crux of her complaint. Nationwide 
dont have the call she made to them when she said these payments were made. Theyve 
said that they dont dispute what she said and made her a goodwill payment of £50. But they 
didnt agree that theyd made an error  and therefore her card account balance stayed the 
same. Ms S has shown us the evidence of several payments to Nationwide  but not the 
payments made in April 2019. So, we dont have firm evidence that a further £20 was paid. 
And without that, Im afraid I cant make a decision in her favour. And  as Nationwide paid 
her compensation of £50, this was more than the amount of £20 in dispute  so Ms S wasnt 
out of pocket. And, she couldve paid the goodwill payment into her card account.  
I can see that Ms S feels strongly about her complaint. And so, shell be disappointed by my 
decision, but I wont be asking Nationwide to do anything more here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 April 2021.
