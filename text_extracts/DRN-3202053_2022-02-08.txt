The complaint
Mr D complains that MotoNovo Finance Limited wrongly and unfairly added charges to a hire 
purchase agreement. He also disputes the sum needed to settle the agreement. 
What happened
In January 2020 Mr D entered into a five-year hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo. He 
was provided with credit of £8,400 and was to make monthly payments of just over £200 a 
month. He set up a direct debit to cover those payments. 
In March 2020 Mr D changed the direct debit details and payment date, and he changed the 
payment date again in August 2020. 
In April 2021 Mr D closed his bank account. MotoNovo was unable to collect the direct debit 
payments, although Mr D continued to make the monthly payments due by payment card. 
MotoNovo however applied a fee of £5 each month  even though payments were made on 
time. In July 2021 Mr D complained about the fees. MotoNovo agreed after some delay to 
refund £25 in fees and offered to pay Mr D £75 in recognition of the delay in dealing with the 
complaint. 
Mr D did not accept the offer and paid MotoNovo £6,000 to settle the hire purchase 
agreement and keep the car for which he had taken it out. MotoNovo said that the figure he 
had paid was not sufficient; Mr D needed to pay just over £900 more. Mr D referred the 
matter to this service. 
Our investigator did not think that MotoNovo had acted unfairly. Whilst there had been 
delays, the investigator thought that the offer of £75 in compensation was sufficient. The 
settlement figure that Mr D had paid did not necessarily clear the hire purchase agreement. 
Mr D asked that an ombudsman review the case.       
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I accept  as does MotoNovo  that no payments were missed here. Mr D made them 
manually. However, the Terms and Conditions included, at clause 1.1:
You must pay us the amounts shown, and at the times shown, overleaf. All instalments 
must be paid by direct debit unless we agree, in our absolute discretion, to accept 
payment by another method
The Terms and Conditions also set out a tariff for breaches of the hire purchase agreement. 
That included a fee of £5 for Unpaid Direct Debit processing charge.
Mr D did not tell MotoNovo until some months later that he had closed his bank account and 
did not provide details of any new account after April 2021. MotoNovo therefore continued to 
seek payment, and direct debit requests were returned unpaid. In those circumstances, 
MotoNovo was within its rights to add a £5 charge for each unpaid direct debit request. I 
note in any event that £25, representing fees for five months, has been refunded. That is, in 
my view, fair. 
As far as the settlement figure is concerned, this should be calculated in line with the formula 
set out in The Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations 2004. It is of course open to 
a lender and borrower to agree a lower figure between themselves, but I do not believe there 
was any such agreement in this case. And I have no reason to believe that MotoNovos 
figures were calculated other than in line with the Regulations. 
For these reasons, I believe that MotoNovos offer of settlement is fair, and I leave it to Mr D 
to decide whether to accept it. If he still wants to repay any sums outstanding under the hire 
purchase agreement, he will need to request an updated settlement figure from MotoNovo.        
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not require MotoNovo Finance Limited to take any further steps 
to resolve Mr Ds complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2022.
