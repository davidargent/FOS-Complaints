Our adjudicator upheld  Miss Bs complaint  in part and thought the loans 6 to 11 should not 
have been given. Sunny didnt agree in full. So the complaint has now been  passed to me to 
decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN56192402the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Bs complaint.
Miss B hasnt disagreed with our adjudicators  opinion on loans 1 to 5 so I wont be looking 
at these any further as there is no ongoing disagreement about them.  But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Miss Bs other lending. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss B, with a view to seeing  
if there was a point  at which  Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Bs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss B was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss Bs overall pattern of borrowing suggested that she had 
become persistently reliant on short-term loans.  Miss B had borrowed on six 
occasions in 12 months and whilst  the amounts fluctuated, they didnt significantly 
decrease over this period and for the rest of the borrowing relationship with Sunny. 
So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Miss B was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Bs first loan was for £150  and loan 6 was for £200.  At  this point Sunny ought 
to have known  that Miss B was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in 
their income but to meet an ongoing need.  
Ref: DRN56192403From  loan 6 onwards  Miss B was sometimes provided with a new loan when still 
paying for previous loans. 
Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan 11 was 
taken out 18 months after Miss Bs first. And it was for a larger  amount. Miss B had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Miss B lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Bs ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 11 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss B paid on loans 6 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 11 should be removed from 
Miss Bs credit file.
If Miss B still owes Sunny any of the principal balance she borrowed on her final loan Sunny 
should remove all the interest and charges applied to the outstanding balance. Sunny  should  
then re-work the account as if all payments made by Miss B went  to towards the principal. 
But importantly, Sunny needs to make sure that Miss B doesnt repay  more  than the 
principal amount borrowed.
If after doing this Miss B hasnt repaid the principal  she borrowed Sunny can deduct this 
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Miss B has already paid enough to repay the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to her with 8% simple interest from the
date of payment  to the date of settlement.
And if Sunny no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Miss B.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
Ref: DRN56192404For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Bs complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 April 2020.
