The complaint
Mr S complains about two charging orders applied to his domestic property by National 
Westminster Bank Plc and about the bank not providing reasonable assistance to get them 
removed. 
What happened
In September 2021, Mr S sought to re-mortgage his domestic property, but found that 
potential lenders declined to lend due to two existing charges on his property. Until this time, 
Mr S was unaware of these charges. 
Mr S says that he spent considerable time trying to understand what had happened, phoning 
and emailing NatWest regularly without getting any answers. Eventually, in April 2022, he 
sought the help of our service. We contacted NatWest in May 2022 and lodged Mr Ss 
complaint.
NatWest explained that the two charges had been placed on Mr Ss property in 2019 
pursuant to court orders in 2008 (interim) and 2009 (final). The court orders related to two 
debts which still remained outstanding, each of around £30,000. The debts had arisen from 
two fixed rate loans issued to Mr S in 2005, one related to his business, which I shall call H, 
and the other to him personally. Mr S said that H had stopped trading in 2005. 
NatWest said that it had not pursued Mr S for Hs debt since 2014. NatWest proposed a 
settlement that, if Mr S repaid his personal debt, it would cancel the debt relating to H, and 
remove both charges. It also apologised that it had provided a poor service in responding to 
Mr Ss requests for information and paid him £400 in compensation.
Mr S says that he has no knowledge of ever taking out a personal loan with NatWest. He 
also says that he cannot recall ever being notified by NatWest of an application to court, and 
he does not believe he was ever afforded the opportunity to attend a court hearing. Mr S 
asked us to look into things further.
Our investigator considered Mr Ss complaint but said that, in her view, on the basis of the 
evidence available, she didnt believe NatWest had done anything wrong in relation to the 
charges. She also said she thought the compensation offered by NatWest for the distress 
and inconvenience caused to Mr S by the poor service the bank had provided in responding 
to Mr Ss enquiries was fair and reasonable in the circumstances, and in line with what our 
service would award.
Mr S didnt agree with this view so asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
While I have read carefully the full correspondence between Mr S and NatWest and 
considered all the evidence submitted, I have focussed my decision on the matters which I 
consider central to this complaint. I have set out below separately my thoughts on the 
charges on Mr Ss property and the process to resolve matters.
The charges on Mr Ss property
The two charges on Mr Ss property relate to two outstanding loans. Given NatWest has 
offered to cancel the loan to Mr Ss business upon repayment of the loan to Mr S personally, 
I have focussed my attention on the personal loan. It is also this loan that Mr S has most 
strongly denied knowing anything about.
Mr S has given several reasons why he thinks NatWest has made a mistake in relation to 
this personal loan. He has said:
He closed his business account with NatWest in 2004 or 2005 and closed his 
personal account long before that; while NatWest say the loan was issued in 2005
The sort code of the loan account statement provided by NatWest is from 
Manchester, which is not anywhere near the location of the two branches at which he 
banked
NatWest took 11 months to find a statement, or to provide any evidence, in relation to 
this outstanding debt
In response, NatWest has provided the following evidence:
An historical statement extract from Mr Ss current account, which shows £20,000 
being credited in 2005
A list of transactions on Mr Ss personal loan account, showing the opening 
outstanding liability including interest and fees, reducing with monthly repayments, 
and resulting in an outstanding debt of approximately £30,000 in November 2008
A bank statement from August 2022 showing an outstanding loan balance of 
approximately £30,000, which had carried forward unchanged from August 2021
Letters sent to Mr S, at the address both we and NatWest hold on file, by solicitors 
acting on behalf of NatWest between 2014 and 2021 to chase the outstanding debt, 
all referring to the court order of 2009
NatWest also explained that all flat rate loans were issued at the time from the same sort 
code registered in Manchester. And it has apologised for the long delays in providing Mr S 
with answers to his questions.
We asked NatWest for the loan agreement and for the documents submitted to the court in 
2008 but, due to the passage of time, these were not available.
It is not for me to consider the process conducted by the court in 2008 and 2009 to assess 
the outstanding loans. However, given the resulting charging orders, I believe sufficient 
reliable evidence must have been provided to the court to validate these loans. Therefore, 
on the basis of this evidence, and on the documentation provided by NatWest, I believe it 
most likely that the loans were taken out by Mr S and that he remains liable for the 
outstanding debt. Therefore, I believe the charges on his property are legitimate.
I have considered whether NatWest has made reasonable efforts to keep Mr S informed of 
these outstanding loans. I note that NatWest has acknowledged that it ceased chasing Mr S 
for the debt relating to his business in 2014  but NatWest has now offered to cancel this 
debt, subject to the personal loan being repaid. I also acknowledge that Mr S does not 
believe he has received any correspondence from NatWest or its solicitors in relation to the 
personal debt, but this is at odds with the letters supplied by NatWests solicitors which are correctly addressed. I cannot say for sure whether these letters were sent or received but I 
believe it most likely that they were sent, which means that I believe NatWest made 
reasonable efforts to keep Mr S informed of his outstanding liability.
NatWest could clearly have done more as it is not clear that it notified Mr S in 2014 that it 
was ceasing to chase him in relation to the business debt, or in 2019 that it was applying the 
charges to Mr Ss property in accordance with the charging orders. It appears that NatWest 
could have done more to engage with Mr S over many years in relation to these outstanding 
loans.
However, I also note that no interest has accrued to these loans since 2008 and no fees or 
default charges have been applied, so the real value of these loans will have fallen over 
fifteen years. In addition, I note that NatWest has now offered to cancel one of the debts.
Since the involvement of our service, Mr S has made various offers to NatWest to settle 
matters and to enable the charges to be removed. However, given that I believe the debts 
are valid and the charges legitimate, any settlement agreement is a matter between Mr S 
and NatWest.
The process to resolve matters
NatWest has acknowledged and apologised for the poor service it has provided to Mr S in 
response to his many enquiries about the charges on his property. It took the bank far too 
long to explain why the charges were there and to provide information and evidence of the 
outstanding debts. Mr S says this had a major effect on his emotional and physical 
wellbeing, and not being able to remove the charges precluded him from re-mortgaging, 
which meant continuing to pay much higher interest rates than would otherwise be the case.
NatWest has paid Mr S £400 in compensation for its poor service.
In my view, given I believe the charges are legitimate, I do not hold NatWest responsible for 
Mr Ss inability to re-mortgage. However, I do think the delays in providing information meant 
that Mr S remained unaware for longer than necessary about the debts, which precluded him 
from doing anything about them. I also acknowledge that the circumstances of this complaint 
relate to events from many years ago, so obtaining documentation would have taken some 
time  but I think it took far longer than necessary.
I am aware that NatWest has offered to write off one of the outstanding debts, worth 
approximately £30,000, upon payment of the other debt. I do not comment on this settlement 
offer as it is a matter for Mr S and NatWest to determine how the outstanding debts are 
settled. However, I do think it is important context for determining the fair amount of 
compensation in this case. 
In the circumstances, I believe the £400 already paid by NatWest is fair.
I am aware that Mr S will not agree with this outcome. But, for the reasons set out above, I 
think the amount already paid by NatWest to Mr S is fair compensation in all the 
circumstances of this case for its delays in providing Mr S with the information and evidence 
he needed. It is for Mr S and NatWest to reach an agreement to settle the outstanding loans 
so the charges on Mr Ss property can be removed. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 April 2023.
