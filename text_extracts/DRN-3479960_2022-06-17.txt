The complaint
Mr F complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) restricted access to his account 
without giving a reason. Mr F also complains PayPal delayed returning his funds, provided 
poor customer service, and caused him distress and inconvenience.  
What happened
In May 2020, PayPal told Mr F is was placing a permanent limitation on his account. PayPal 
added, that after reviewing Mr Fs account, it had determined hed violated its Acceptable 
Use Policy. It also said that in line with the terms of the account, funds in the account will be 
held for 180 days. 
In October 2020, PayPal asked Mr F to provide it with documents to prove his identity. Mr F 
says he sent this to PayPal. But PayPal say it never received any such documentation. 
Unhappy with PayPals actions, Mr F complained. Mr F says he sent two written complaints 
to PayPal in November 2020, but never got a response. Because of that he complained 
again in the Summer of 2021. 
As PayPal didnt uphold Mr Fs complaint, he referred it to this service.  
In September 2021, Mr F received an email from PayPal which said he could now withdraw 
his funds. But Mr F still wanted this service to consider the customer service he had 
received; PayPal not responding to his complaint emails for several months; not getting a 
explanation for why his funds were withheld, and why it took this services intervention for his 
funds to be returned. 
One of our Investigators then looked into the matter. In summary, they initially found that:
- PayPal had acted fairly in reviewing and restricting Mr Fs account as it has legal and 
regulatory obligations it must follow
- PayPal applied the terms of its Acceptable Use Policy fairly which permitted it to hold 
any funds in the account for 180 days 
- Once the 180 days had passed, PayPal asked Mr F to provide proof of his identity in 
line with its regulatory obligations. And once Mr F satisfied PayPals verification 
checks, his funds were released. So PayPal has acted fairly in handling the account
- They hadnt seen anything which persuaded them PayPal should pay compensation 
for poor customer service 
Mr F did not agree with our Investigators initial findings. In summary, he said: 
- He hasnt complained about PayPal placing a limitation on his account 
- He provided PayPal with his identity documents as requested in October 2020, after 
which it still didnt release his funds. And if he hadnt done this, theres no reason why 
he continued to complain to PayPal
- PayPal released his funds in October 2021, well after 180 days from the limitation 
being placed, and well after he had provided his identity documents 
- He made complaints in June and July 2021 without any response from PayPal
- PayPals customer service is appalling, and it should pay him compensation 
PayPal reiterated it had not received any identity documents from Mr F nor any complaint 
correspondence from June and July 2021. It added it can hold funds for longer than 180 
days. And, in September 2021, PayPal deemed there was no longer any significant concern, 
so it returned Mr Fs funds  in turn, no longer requiring proof of identity. 
Our Investigator then changed their opinion and said they recommended Mr Fs complaint is 
upheld in part. Some of the key findings they made were: 
- PayPal released Mr Fs funds in September 2021 without sight of the proof of identity 
it had been asking for. And, only a month before in its submission to this service, it 
had said it still required this
- Mr F had provided copy of emails where he had attempted to contact PayPal about 
withdrawing his funds in June 2021 and July 2021. PayPal appear to have sent 
automated responses, saying that if the account was under review and they needed 
anything from Mr F, it would get in touch. 
If at this point, PayPal had not received the proof of identity, it wouldve have been 
fair for it to have highlighted and repeated its request to Mr F 
- Mr F was able to withdraw his funds in September 2021 without PayPal having 
received his identity proof. This along with PayPals lack of proactive contact means 
it acted unfairly in holding onto Mr Fs funds for nearly a year after the initial 180-days 
limitation had elapsed 
- Theres no evidence to show PayPal withholding Mr Fs funds prevented him from 
meeting essential living costs
- PayPal should pay Mr F £50 for the trouble and upset it caused by not giving him 
access to his funds for nearly a year longer than it likely should have
Mr F didnt agree £50 was fair compensation for the time its taken him to sort his complaint 
out  and the trouble and upset hes suffered. He adds this amount of compensation will not 
lead to PayPal changing its practices to the benefit of other customers. 
PayPal did not agree with our Investigators latest findings. So, given PayPal do not agree, 
and as Mr F has questioned the amount of compensation recommended, the complaint has 
now been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Ive decided to uphold Mr Fs complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
Financial businesses in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing 
monitoring of an existing business relationship. That sometimes means regulated firms need 
to restrict, or in some cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
Ive closely reviewed PayPals terms - which includes its Acceptable Use Policy. Given the 
legal and regulatory obligations placed on PayPal, and what its terms say, Im satisfied it 
acted fairly when deciding to review and then restrict Mr Fs account. 
PayPals terms say it can block an account and/or hold any funds in the reserve account for 
more than 180 days if required. By holding onto Mr Fs funds for 180 days from when the 
initial limitation was placed, Im persuaded PayPal acted in line with the terms of the 
account. 
Im also persuaded this action was proportionate given PayPals concerns that initiated the 
review. To that end, Mr F wants to know PayPals reasons for deciding to review and place a 
restriction on his account. Im not aware of any obligation that compels either PayPal, or 
myself, to disclose this reason.
PayPal say that when the 180-day period ended it asked Mr F to provide it with proof of his 
identity. Mr F says he supplied it  but PayPal say it never got this from him. PayPal doesnt 
have any records to show it received this. Nor have I seen anything from Mr F that shows 
conclusively he did send it. Given the lack of any evidence here, I dont make a finding on 
this point. 
I have however seen emails Mr F sent PayPal around the Summer of 2021. Ive also seen 
the automated responses from PayPal that shows it will get in touch with Mr F if it needs 
anything from him. 
Given Mr F was asking for his funds, I think PayPal should have looked into the matter  and 
at the very least explained it was still waiting for proof of his identity. 
Moreover, PayPal say it decided to give Mr Fs funds back to him in September 2021 without 
seeing the identification document as the risk was no longer that significant to it. But I 
havent seen any evidence which persuades me something changed at that point  
especially as PayPal said it needed this a month earlier. So I question why PayPal didnt 
return the funds earlier  or at the least, chase Mr F to provide it with identification 
documents. 
Im also not persuaded, from what Ive seen, that the funds withheld had a meaningful 
impact on Mr Fs ability to meet essential livings costs. But I do think PayPal couldve been 
more proactive in responding to Mr F so that this matter could have been concluded much 
sooner than it has. This no doubt has caused avoidable inconvenience to Mr F.   
So, with that in mind, I think £50 is fair compensation for PayPal to pay Mr F for the 
inconvenience hes suffered  and its lack of proactive management of the issue and poor 
communication. I dont think PayPal should pay any interest on the funds for the time theyve 
been withheld as Mr F has said they were earmarked for other living costs. 
Lastly, and for the sake of completeness, Mr F says this amount of compensation will not 
lead to PayPal making any changes to the way it operates  and thereby will not result in 
other customers benefitting. My role is to look at the individual merits of this complaint  not 
the broader impact of how a business practices affects its customers.  My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above, I uphold this complaint in part. I now direct 
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to pay Mr F £50.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2022.
