The complaint
Mr I complains that National Westminster Bank Plc closed his account and withheld his 
funds. Hed like his funds returned and compensation for the impact. 
What happened
Mr I had an account with NatWest. 
On 17 March 2021 NatWest wrote a letter to Mr I informing him they would be closing his 
account in 14 days. They also withheld the funds in his account. And they advised him to get 
access to his funds hed need to complete a funds release form including new account 
details and certified identification documents. 
Mr I sent the funds release form to NatWest on three occasions throughout April 2021. 
However NatWest advised that none of the submissions met their requirements  two of the 
forms didnt include identification and the third submission included a passport however this 
wasnt appropriately certified. 
NatWest wrote to Mr I on 24 May 2021 advising him that hed need to submit a further funds 
release form with certified identification. But Mr I didnt reply  and refused to engage with 
NatWest further. 
Mr I wasnt satisfied with NatWests decision to close his account, and their refusal to 
release his funds. He also complained about the way he was treated in branch when trying 
to obtain his funds. 
NatWest reviewed Mr Is complaint. They thought theyd acted fairly when closing his 
account, but thought the staff hadnt acted appropriately when hed visited the branch.
Mr I wasnt satisfied with NatWests response so brought his complaint to our service. 
One of our investigators looked into Mr Is complaint. They thought NatWest had acted fairly 
in closing Mr Is account and restricting access. They thought that the request by NatWest 
for Mr I to complete a funds release form was fair, and as Mr I hadnt provided what was 
required theyd acted fairly in not releasing the funds. Our investigator also asked NatWest if 
Mr I could attend a branch to complete the funds release form and get his documents 
certified and the bank agreed. But Mr I didnt agree to do this. 
But, our investigator didnt think the service NatWest had provided in branch was acceptable 
 and recommended NatWest pay Mr I £100 compensation. 
NatWest accepted our investigators recommendation, but Mr I didnt. In summary he said: 
He accepts NatWest are entitled to close his account, but he doesnt think its fair 
they havent shared their reasons with him
Hes had to abandon his studies because NatWest held on to his funds
He wont sign any documents to retrieve his funds
As Mr I didnt agree its been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Account closure
NatWest are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their legal and 
regulatory obligations. Theyre also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of new and 
existing relationships. They can only close accounts in certain circumstances and if its in the 
terms and conditions of the account. NatWest have relied on the terms and conditions when 
closing Mr Is account. The terms explain that NatWest can close any account by providing 
60 days notice. And in specific circumstances they can close an account by providing less.
Mr Is unhappy that NatWest wont share the reasons with him for the account closure  but 
the bank is under no obligation to do so. Our service has the power to receive information in 
confidence. Ive reviewed the information provided and I agree NatWest have met their 
terms and conditions when providing Mr I 14 days notice.
Restriction of funds
NatWest sent Mr I a letter on 17 March 2021 notifying him that they were closing his account 
by giving 14 days notice. As part of the letter they informed Mr I he could obtain his funds by 
completing the funds released form and providing certified identification documents. Ive 
seen evidence from NatWest that Mr I returned three funds release forms, however two 
didnt include identification and the passport that was returned wasnt certified. Mr I also 
advised he sent in a copy of his driving licence to NatWest, however this wasnt received. I 
understand the loss of this driving licence would be concerning to Mr I, but this isnt 
something I can either hold NatWest responsible for or say if it had been received it would 
make a difference to the funds being released. I say this because the driving licence wasnt 
certified, a requirement of the funds being released. Our investigator also contacted NatWest 
and asked if Mr I could attend a branch to provide the form and Identification  and NatWest 
agreed. However, Mr I refused to attend the branch.
Ive thought about whether NatWests actions in requesting the funds release form and 
certified Identification were fair  and I appreciate Mr I will be disappointed by this, but I think 
NatWests requests were reasonable. If Mr I wishes to regain his funds hell need to 
complete the funds released form, plus certified identification and either return this via post 
or in branch. If Mr I does so, Id expect NatWest to release the funds to him. 
Branch service
Mr Is explained to our service that NatWest staff were abusive when he visited his local 
branch. And in NatWests final response theyve accepted the service wasnt what theyd 
expect. Unfortunately I dont have any further details of what happened when Mr I visited the 
branch. Our investigator contacted Mr I and asked him for details about which branch he 
visited, and how staff behaved that he regarded as abusive, however Mr I refused to provide 
any further details. And NatWest havent been able to provide anything further about the 
visit. Despite this, as NatWest have accepted the service was below the standard theyd 
expect Im satisfied £100 compensation is fair. Putting things right
For the reasons Ive explained above I think NatWest should pay Mr I £100 compensation for 
the distress caused to him in branch. 
My final decision
My final decision is I direct National Westminster Bank Plc to:
Pay Mr I £100 compensation
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 June 2023.
