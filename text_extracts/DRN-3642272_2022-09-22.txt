The complaint
Mr S complains that NewDay Ltd irresponsibly gave him a credit card he couldnt afford to 
repay. 
What happened
In September 2015, Mr S applied for a credit card with NewDay. He was given an initial 
credit limit of £250. The limit was increased to £900 in January 2016 and a final limit 
increase to £1,950 in July 2016. 
In March 2022, Mr S complained to NewDay to say that it shouldnt have given him the credit 
card or the subsequent limit increases. He said that had NewDay completed appropriate 
affordability checks it would have seen that the credit was unaffordable to him. 
NewDay didnt uphold the complaint. It said that it had carried out appropriate checks which 
showed that Mr S could afford the various credit limits it had provided him with. 
Our adjudicator initially explained that Mr S had made his complaint about the opening of the 
credit card and the first credit limit increase too late. Therefore, our service could only 
consider his complaint about the final limit increase in July 2016. Mr S accepted that 
outcome. 
Our adjudicator then recommended that Mr S complaint about the final limit increase should 
be upheld. He said that at the time of the increase NewDay should have seen that providing 
further credit was likely to be unaffordable for Mr S. This was because of the relatively low 
income he had declared, the way hed managed his credit card with NewDay and a large 
increase in his credit commitments elsewhere. 
Mr S accepted that outcome but NewDay didnt respond. The complaint has therefore been 
passed to me for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Prior to lending to Mr S, NewDay was required to ensure it carried out affordability checks. 
There isnt a set list of checks it needed to complete but it needed to ensure those checks 
were proportionate in the circumstances. What is considered proportionate will vary taking 
into consideration things such as (but not limited to): the size of the credit, the cost and Mr S 
circumstances. 
As part of this complaint Im only considering the final limit increase in July 2016, however, in 
doing so Ill consider what NewDay already knew about Mr S circumstances prior to the 
increase as I consider this to be relevant background and context to its decision to lend. 
NewDay says that it understood Mr S had an annual income of around £12,500. At the time 
of the final limit increase he had only had use of the previous limit of £900 for six months. In 
the month that Mr S limit was first increased to £900, he used almost the entire available 
limit on 37 separate cash transactions rather than purchases. Two months later, NewDays 
credit checks showed that Mr S had taken out three payday loans. So, I think this ought to 
have highlighted to NewDay that Mr S was likely struggling with his existing financial 
situation with a limit of £900. 
When NewDay increased the limit to £1,950, the credit checks NewDay completed showed 
that Mr S external unsecured debt was now four times higher than it had been just a few 
months earlier. Further, he had been over his limit on his NewDay credit card and incurred 
charges for this in two of the previous three months. Given all of this, and his relatively low 
income. I think it ought to have been clear to NewDay that more than doubling his existing 
credit limit was likely to be unaffordable and cause him financial difficulty. I therefore dont 
think NewDay made a fair lending decision when it increased the limit to £1,950.     
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to:
Rework the account removing all interest and charges on balances above £900.
If the rework results in a credit balance, it should refund any overpayments to Mr S 
along with 8% simple interest per year from the date of each overpayment to the date 
of settlement. It should also remove any adverse information recorded on Mr S credit 
file from July 2016 onwards. 
If after the rework there is still a balance outstanding, NewDay should ensure it puts 
in place an affordable repayment plan for the outstanding amount. Once the capital 
has been repaid, it should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr S credit 
file from July 2016 onwards.
If NewDay considers tax should be deducted from the interest element of my award it should 
provide Mr S with a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off, so that he can reclaim 
that amount if he is eligible to do so. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 October 2022.
