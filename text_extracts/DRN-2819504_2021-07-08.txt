The complaint
Mr Z complains that a training course that hes been paying for under a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Career Development Finance Limited is no longer available to him.
What happened
Mr Z entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Career Development Finance in 
December 2011 to pay for a plumbing course. The cost of the course was £5,770, he made 
an advance payment of £100 and agreed to make 42 monthly repayments of £135. 
He entered into an individual voluntary arrangement in June 2012, which included the 
amount that he owed to Career Development Finance, which was completed successfully in 
June 2019. He says that he contacted the course provider in about June 2020 about his 
options for taking the course and he then complained to Career Development Finance. 
It said that the course provider had declined to offer further services in respect of the training 
course in accordance with its contractual rights under the agreement made in December 
2011 and that it was in no position to negotiate with the course provider on Mr Zs behalf 
regarding its response to his request for services. Mr Z wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She was satisfied 
that Career Development Finance had reviewed his complaint fairly and reasonably. She 
said that although the terms and conditions of the contract didnt clearly show that Mr Z 
wouldnt be able to continue the course after the completion of his individual voluntary 
arrangement, she thought it unlikely that hed be able to restart a course outside the 
contracted duration without prior arrangement.
Mr Z has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that:
it was his understanding that the training would only commence when the course had 
been funded and the course provider didnt contact him about starting the training;
when his individual voluntary arrangement was in place, he was advised not to make 
any contact with any of his creditors so its not correct to say that he was at fault for 
not making contact with the course provider or Career Development Finance;
Career Development Finance was sold and changed its contact details, but it didnt 
advise him of the sale which had implications for him; 
he is still keen to train as a plumber and requests that the £2,500 that has been paid 
to Career Development Finance be applied to his training and it can't be fair that one 
of the parties wants to rely totally on the initial terms of the contract and complains 
that he didn't advise it in time but doesn't allow him to undertake the original training. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr Z signed the loan agreement in December 2011 and entered into an individual 
voluntary arrangement in June 2012;
he says that he didnt start the training course, wasnt contacted by the course 
provider and understood that the course would only commence when hed paid for it 
 but thats not consistent with the course providers terms and conditions or the 
reason for entering into the loan agreement (which is to borrow the money so that he 
could take the course while paying for it   rather than having to save enough money 
to pay for it in advance);
I consider that Mr Z ought reasonably to have known that the course was available to 
him soon after he entered into the loan agreement and that it would be reasonable to 
expect him to have contacted the course provider about the course if he had started 
paying for it but hadnt been contacted by the course provider;
Mr Zs individual voluntary arrangement was completed in June 2019 but he then 
didnt contact the course provider about the course until June 2020  about a year 
later  and I consider that, if hed wanted to start the course when his individual 
voluntary arrangement ended, it would be reasonable to expect him to have 
contacted the course provider soon after it had been completed;
even if hed contacted the course provider when his individual voluntary arrangement 
ended, that would have been about seven and a half years after he signed the loan 
agreement and I consider it to be unlikely that the course would have been available 
to him at that time;
Mr Z contacted the course provider in about June 2020 and then complained to 
Career Development Finance but it said that the duration of the course was between 
12 and 36 months so he had until December 2014 to complete it;
Mr Z has described the difficulties that he encountered in contacting Career 
Development Finance after it was sold  but Im not persuaded that hes provided 
enough evidence to show that hes been adversely impacted as a result because he 
wouldnt have been able to take the course if hed been able to contact it as soon as 
he tried to;
Career Development Finance has confirmed that Mr Zs account with it has been 
closed, the outstanding balance of the loan agreement has been written-off and it 
doesnt expect any further payments from Mr Z;
I sympathise with Mr Z for the financial difficulties that hes suffered and for the loss 
that hes incurred in paying for a course that he hasnt used and from which hes had 
no benefit  but Im not persuaded that it would be reasonable to expect the course 
provider to keep the course available to him in these circumstances and I consider 
that Career Development Finance has responded to his complaint correctly; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Career Development 
Finance to arrange for the course provider to make the course available to him, to 
refund him for any of the payments that hes made for the course, to pay him any 
other compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Zs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Z to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 August 2021.
