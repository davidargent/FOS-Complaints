K822xcomplaint
Mr D complains that CarCashPoint  Limited  (CarCashPoint) didnt respond positively and 
sympathetically when  he had financial difficulties because of mental health issues  and being 
in and out of work. As a result he was unable  to make repayments  on the logbook loan he 
had from CarCashPoint.  He is represented  in bringing this complaint  by his partner, Ms F.
background 
In November 2017, Mr D took out a logbook loan from CarCashPoint  under which  he agreed 
to repay  a loan and interest totalling £5,336.76  by 156 weekly  instalments of £34.21  each. 
The effect of the documents Mr D signed  was that ownership of his car was transferred to 
CarCashPoint as security  for repayment  of the loan and interest.
Shortly after taking out the loan Mr D became unable to maintain the instalments due to his 
mental health issues and being  out of work.  He was unhappy with CarCashPoints  customer 
service such as its representatives coming  to collect payments on days  they weren't 
supposed to, and the manner in which its adviser  spoke with him on the phone. He 
complained to us and said that as a settlement  he wanted an affordable  repayment plan.
Our investigator didnt  recommend that this complaint should be upheld.  He said that 
CarCashPoints file showed that it had offered  a number of repayment  plans in the past.  
However all had failed  shortly after being agreed. Finally,  in view of the arrears  on the 
account, CarCashPoint had taken possession of the car and was threatening to sell it.
CarCashPoint did offer to return  the car provided  the arrears  that had accumulated by then 
were paid in full. But Mr D wasnt able to do this. Ultimately he agreed to the car being sold 
at public auction. This was done  and the proceeds after the sale costs were  applied in 
settling the loan agreement. A balance of £1,004.40  remained owing. CarCashPoint  agreed 
to write this off and not pursue Mr D to pay this.
The investigator thought this was a fair and reasonable  offer in the circumstances as it left 
Mr D with no further payments to make. However Mr D responded to say, in summary, that 
he didnt agree this was a fair outcome. He said the way he and Ms F were spoken to, 
shouted at, and lied to by CarCashPoints  staff was unreasonable and unsympathetic.  He 
had been asked for proof of his mothers death  and his mental  records which  he thought was 
wrong.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
From CarCashPoints records, I think  that before it granted the loan, it took reasonable steps 
to ascertain that the loan would be affordable  by Mr D. However shortly after the loan was 
granted Mr D lost his job, and had difficulty in getting  other employment. This and mental 
health issues he suffered  from meant he was unable to make the agreed weekly 
repayments, or catch up with the arrears  that accrued. 
Its clear from its records that CarCashPoint made a number of attempts to agree 
sustainable repayment plans with Mr D, but these all failed quickly.  It did ask for some  
evidence of what Mr D was telling  it, for example, about his mental health problems to 
Ref: DRN63113162explain his non payment. The Money  Advice  Liaison Group Guidelines  for mental  health  and 
debt make it clear that this isnt unreasonable. So I cant  say CarCashPoint was wrong  to 
ask for this.
From the correspondence Ive seen, and the copy phone  calls it supplied, I dont think 
CarCashPoint was unsympathetic.  And from the correspondence Ive seen, and the phone 
calls Ive listened to, I havent seen anything  to suggest it lied, or that its staff shouted at    
Mr D and Ms F.
Ultimately, as a sustainable repayment arrangement couldnt be maintained,  CarCashPoint  
repossessed the car and arranged for it to be sold at auction. However it has written  off the 
outstanding balance of £1,004.40 which remained owing  on Mr Ds account and confirmed it 
wont ask Mr D to pay this. I think this is fair and reasonable  in the circumstances, and dont  
require CarCashPoint  to do anything more.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint,  and make  no order  against CarCashPoint  
Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 March 2019.
