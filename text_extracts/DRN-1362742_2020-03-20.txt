The complaint
Miss S says Pinnacle Insurance Plc mis-sold her a mortgage payment protection insurance 
(MPPI) policy.
What happened
Miss S took out an MPPI policy with a mortgage in 1996. She paid a monthly amount for the 
policy.  
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Miss S disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Miss Ss case. 
Ive decided not to uphold Miss Ss complaint for the following reasons
Miss S wouldve completed an application form specifically for the MPPI, separately to her 
mortgage application form. So, I think Pinnacle made Miss S aware that she had a choice 
about buying the MPPI, and that she chose to take it. 
Pinnacle recommended the MPPI to Miss S, and it seems to have been right for her based 
on what Ive seen of her circumstances at the time. She had limited sick or redundancy pay 
available. And although she had some savings, the PPI wouldve protected these so she 
couldve got by for longer without risking losing her home if she couldnt work. 
Its possible that Pinnacle couldve explained the cost of the policy better than it did. But 
even if it had, I think Miss S would still have bought it.
Its possible Pinnacle didnt point out the main things the policy didnt cover. But Miss S 
doesnt appear to have been affected by any of those things. 
Ive taken into account Miss Ss comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Miss Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 April 2020.
