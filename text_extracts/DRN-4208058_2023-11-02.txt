The complaint and what happened
Mr H is unhappy that Skipton Building Society introduced him to a third party to undertake an 
Energy Performance Assessment and that assessment resulted in his propertys energy 
rating being downgraded.
Mr H thinks Skipton should be held responsible for this downgrade  and should help him 
appeal the assessment  because it owns the estate agent which owns the third-party 
assessor.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to disappoint Mr H, but I think the adjudicator reached a fair conclusion in this case 
and theres little I can think to add to whats already been said. 
Mr H seems to want us to make a decision about whether an agency-relationship exists 
between Skipton and the third-party assessor. But I really think the underlying issue here is 
that Skipton advertised an offer for a free Energy Performance Assessment. I dont think the 
advert was unclear or misleading and Mr H chose to take up the offer. Hes unhappy with the 
result of the assessment, but he has an alternative right of recourse with the assessor which 
I understand he is now pursuing. And he can, ultimately, refer the matter to the assessors 
accreditation scheme if he remains unhappy.
In all the circumstances, I cant fairly say that here is anything more the society need to do 
here.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2023.
