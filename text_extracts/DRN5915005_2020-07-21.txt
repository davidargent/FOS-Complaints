K820x#14complaint
Mr A complains about the management of his account by Shop Direct Finance Company 
Limited (Very),  including its decision to report certain information  about it to credit  reference 
agencies.
background
In September  2017 Mr A purchased an appliance from Very for £159.99. This transaction 
was posted to his account  on 5 September 2017 on buy now pay later terms with interest 
estimated at £67.48.
In mid to late 2018 Mr A complained to Very that the appliance he had purchased in 
September 2017 was faulty.
On 1 September 2018 Mr A was advised by Very that to avoid paying interest of £132.07 
(including £67.48 in respect of his September 2017  appliance purchase) on items totalling 
£370.01 (including £159.99 in respect of his September 2017 appliance purchase) he 
needed to make a payment of £370.01 by 21 September 2018.  Mr A didnt make  this 
payment and £132.07 interest was charged to his account.
In September  2018 Mr A purchased a replacement appliance from Very for £189.99.  This 
transaction was posted to his account on 22 September 2018 on buy now pay later terms 
with interest estimated at £37.51.
In October  and November  2018 Very posted  a number of adjustments to Mr As account 
totalling £264.46. In essence  this sum was made  up of the following refunds:
2017 appliance cost  £159.99
buy now pay later interest on the 2017 appliance £67.48
delivery charge  on the 2018  appliance £6.99
price difference  between the 2017 and 2018  appliances £30.00
In November 2018 Mr A wrote to Very. He said that because the faulty appliance had 
caused him to incur  expenses of £700 (money he would have otherwise used to service  his 
account) Very shouldnt  report  him as being in arrears for the months of October and 
November 2018  with credit reference agencies. He also said that Very shouldnt seek  from 
him, going forwards, these two months missed payments as part of its minimum payment 
request from him, at least  for a period  of time.
In December 2018 Very wrote  to Mr A to say that it accepted  his September  2017  appliance  
was faulty and that because of this it had posted a number of adjustments to his account 
(£264.46). It also said that it understood an earlier offer it had made to pay him £200 had 
been rejected.
In February 2019  Very agreed to pay Mr A £770 and to not record any adverse or 
detrimental information with credit reference  agencies for the period October 2018 to 
February 2019 inclusive in respect of the faulty appliance.
Mr A then wrote to our service to say that Very had recorded adverse or detrimental  
information with credit reference agencies for one or more of the months it had agreed not 
to, that it should  remove any interest and charges on his arrears and pay him £500 say.
Ref: DRN59150052This complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view it shouldnt 
be upheld.
Mr A didnt agree so his complaint was passed  to me for review and decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in May 2020. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Its clear Mr A has very strong feelings about this complaint.  He has provided  detailed 
submissions in support  of his view which I can confirm  Ive read and considered  in 
their entirety. However, I trust that Mr A will not take the fact that my findings  focus  
on what I consider to be the central  issues, and that they are expressed in 
considerably less detail, as a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to 
address every point  raised. The purpose of my decision is to set out my conclusions  
and reasons for reaching them.
I would also like to point  out that where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive  or 
contradictory, I make my decision on the balance of probabilities - that is, what  I 
consider is most likely to have happened given the evidence that is available and the 
wider surrounding  circumstances.
First I would point out that Im only considering  in this decision whether Very has 
acted correctly, fairly and reasonably in:
its collection activity on Mr As account between October 2018 and July 2019
debiting the interest  and charges  to Mr As account that it has between  
October 2018 and July 2019  
noting in its records what  it has, between October  2018  and July 2019, about  
the status of Mr As account  in particular the arrears balance and the 
minimum payment required
reporting what it has, between October  2018 and July 2019, about  the status 
of Mr As account  to credit reference  agencies 
Im not considering  any other complaint Mr A might  have, including any complaint  he 
might have about being unable to make payments (for one or more months)  to his 
account online.
Ref: DRN59150053collection activity between  October  2018 and July 2019
Ive considered what both parties have said and submitted  on this point. And having 
done so Im not persuaded that Very has acted  incorrectly, unfairly or unreasonably 
in its collection activity  between October 2018 and July 2019.  I can also see that in 
January 2019  Very explained the options  open to Mr A if he was struggling to make  
payments to his account.
interest and charges debited between October 2018  and July 2019
I will begin by explaining  that our service  doesnt audit accounts. Nor do we have any 
power to tell Very how to apply interest  and charges.  This means that in reaching my 
decision Ive not carried out my own calculations. Instead Ive looked at everything  
Mr A and Very have said and provided  on this particular point. And having done so I 
can confirm that Im not persuaded that there has been any material miscalculation  in 
the interest and charges debited to Mr As account by Very between October 2018 
and July 2019. Ive also seen nothing  that would lead me to conclude that Very has 
been unfair or unreasonable  in what it has charged  Mr A in interest and charges in 
this period.
the status of Mr As account recorded by Very in its own records  between  
October 2018 and July 2019
Mr A disagrees with what Very has recorded in its own records  about  the conduct  of 
his account, in particular the running arrears  balance  and the minimum payment 
required from him.
Mr A says that he was unable to make  through  no fault of his own and for reasons 
that are well known to the parties  account  payments for October  and 
November 2018  totalling approximately £700. And because of this its incorrect 
and/or unfair for Very to include  this sum in what it records  as being his running 
arrears balance and the minimum payment required from him.
First Im not persuaded  that Very acted incorrectly, or unfairly, in how it recorded  in 
its own records the two payments  totalling  approximately £700 missed  by Mr A, or 
that it would  be appropriate for me to interfere with such a decision. But even if I 
wasnt of this view I cant see how this has in itself caused Mr A a financial loss, or 
material distress  and inconvenience. Its also my understanding that Mr A was in a 
position to make good these two missed payments on receipt from Very of the 
payment of £770  and, for whatever reason, he didnt do so. 
Since receiving Verys payment of £770  I think it could be said that any concerns 
Mr A might have about what Very has recorded in respect of the two missed  
payments totalling  approximately £700 was as a result of what he has done  or not 
done, not what Very has done  or not done.
I also think that its worth pointing out that in July 2019 Very records  Mr A has having 
both a running arrears  balance and a minimum payment requirement of 
approximately £4,000. Therefore it could be said that Mr As two missed payments 
totalling approximately £700  have no material effect  on how Very view Mr As 
account status and conduct.
Ref: DRN59150054information recorded by Very with credit reference  agencies
Very agreed with Mr A that it wouldnt record (for the period October 2018 to 
February 2019) any adverse account  information with credit  reference agencies in 
respect of his faulty appliance. And having looked at one such report  dated 
July 2019  I think Very did what it said it would do.
This report shows the following information  in respect of Mr As Very account:
[6] 6 6 U 4 U U U U 0
Given this account  is noted as being last updated in July 2019 and should be read 
from left to right I think the above  can reasonably be interpreted  as follows:
Jul Jun May Apr Mar Feb Jan Dec Nov Oct
[6] 6 6 U 4 U U U U 0
Based on my interpretation above  it can be seen that from May 2019  onwards Mr As 
account shows as having an account status of 6. Now I appreciate  Mr A, for various 
reasons, might disagree with this account  rating.  But having considered Mr As 
account activity  for the period since October 2018 (including payments made by him 
to it) Im satisfied  this status isnt incorrect.
I would add that even if my interpretation of Mr As credit file above is incorrect, I 
think what has been recorded by Very is in the spirit of what  it agreed to do. I would 
also add that Im not persuaded  that any of the adjustments Mr A believes should  be 
made by Very to his credit file would have  any material  impact on Mr As credit  rating  
or score or how third party parties might  view him.
Furthermore Very only agreed with Mr A to not record adverse information with credit  
reference agencies  between October 2018 and February 2019 in respect of the faulty 
appliance, not anything else. So given what I know about Mr As account conduct 
between these two dates it could be said that Very wasnt necessarily obliged to 
report Mr As account status  as U or 0 for the number of months that it did.
So in summary,  and in respect of the four issues considered by me above,  Im not 
persuaded that Very has done anything wrong.
Mr A responded to say, in summary:
He wasnt in a position to pay Very the two missed payments on receipt from it of 
£770 due to its payment portal  requesting huge sums of money  in thousands  from 
him.
Our own services guidance would  suggest he is entitled to compensation of up to 
£500 for distress  and inconvenience.
Very hasnt kept to its end of the agreement  not to record  adverse information  for the 
period October  2018 to February 2019  and he would like to know which  credit  report I 
was referring to when  I concluded it had.
Ref: DRN59150055His credit  report affected a job which led to losses .
Mr A then asked:
How did our service  get the report referred to by me in my provisional decision?
How did I read,  from the report referred  to by me in my provisional  decision, Verys 
compliance with its undertaking that it wouldnt record (for the period October  2018  to 
February 2019) any adverse account  information with credit  reference agencies in 
respect of his faulty appliance?
Would we like to see a copy of his credit report that he holds?
Mr A then provided an extract of his credit report that he was holding  and asked on what  
authority our service  had obtained  a copy of his credit report that I referred  to in my 
provisional decision.
Very responded  to say that it accepted my provisional decision  and that it had nothing further 
to add.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I can confirm that I see 
no reason to depart from my provisional findings  and provisional decision.
First I would like to point out that Im satisfied that Mr A has had enough time to provide 
anything and everything he wants to in response  to my provisional decision and I see no 
good reason to delay issuing this final decision.
Secondly, and for the sake of clarity,  I would  point out that Mr A has been advised on what  
authority our service  obtained a copy of his credit report and how. He has also been advised 
how the same was interpreted by me. 
Mr A says he wasnt in a position to pay Very the two missed payments for October and 
November 2018  on receipt of £770 from it in February 2019 because  of problems with its 
payment portal. However I disagree.  
As I said in my provisional decision Im not considering here any complaint Mr A might  have 
about being unable to make payments (for one or more months) to his account  online. But I 
dont think I need  to. I say this because in my view on receipt of the £770 from Very in 
February 2019 Mr A could  have made  payment by means other than online, for example  
over the phone. 
Mr A says he should be awarded  something for the distress and inconvenience this whole 
matter has caused  him and our services own guidance suggests payment  of up to £500 
wouldnt be inappropriate.
I accept that had I found Very had done something  wrong then an award  for distress  and 
inconvenience might  have been appropriate.  But I didnt find (in respect  of the complaint Im 
considering here)  that Very did anything  wrong (and I still dont)  so its entirely  reasonable for 
me to make no award  in Mr As favour for distress and inconvenience.
Ref: DRN59150056I remain of the view that Very kept to its end of the agreement to not record  adverse 
information for the period  October 2018 to February  2019 given  the content of the full credit 
report obtained by our service dated  July 2019 and my interpretation of the same.
I accept that the credit  report extract Mr A has provided our service dated May 2019  shows  
the following:
October 2018 QY
November 2018 QY
December 2018 QY
January 2019 QY
February 2019 BB 4
March 2019 QY
April 2019 BB6
May 2019 BB6
However, I dont think the above credit report extract is wrong.
In February 2019  Very agreed to pay Mr A £770 and to not record any adverse or 
detrimental information with credit reference  agencies for the period October 2018 to 
February 2019 inclusive in respect of the faulty appliance. But it didnt undertake to not 
record any other adverse  information, for example  information in respect of other contractual 
payments not made by Mr A.
Now between October 2018 and February 2019  Mr A paid very little, if anything,  to his Very 
account. So in my view Very wasnt incorrect to conclude that in February 2019 Mr A was (in 
respect of his other payment  obligations)  four months in arrears  and that it wasnt  
necessarily obliged to report Mr As account status as QY for October 2018 to 
January 2019  and for March 2019.
But even if I wasnt of the above  view I would reiterate that I think that what  has been 
recorded by Very is in the spirit  of what it agreed  to do and that any of the adjustments Mr A 
believes should be made by Very to his credit file wouldnt  have any material impact on his 
credit rating or score or how third party parties might  view him.
Mr A says his credit  report  affected a job which led to losses. But Im not persuaded by this 
submission. Notwithstanding Im of the view that Very hasnt recorded  with credit reference  
agencies anything incorrectly,  or anything it had agreed not to, Mr A has provided  very little, 
if anything, by way of evidence in support of his submission in this respect.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 August 2020.
