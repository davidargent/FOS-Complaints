An adjudicator considered Mr M's complaint and thought it should be largely upheld - she 
didn't think Sunny should've approved loans 4 to 35. This was because she thought 
proportionate checks would've shown loans 4 to 12 were not sustainably affordable for Mr M 
and because the pattern of lending from loan 13 onwards was enough on its own to 
demonstrate that the lending was no longer sustainably affordable.
Sunny didn't agree with the adjudicator but did make an offer to uphold the complaint from 
loan 27 onwards. Mr M didn't accept that offer. As there was no agreement, the complaint 
was passed to me to decide. There's been no ongoing dispute about loans 1 to 3 since the 
adjudication, so I've not looked at those loans.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, proportionate checks for loans 4 onwards would've likely 
shown Mr M was having problems managing his money. I've seen that Mr M declared he 
had a monthly income of about £1,192 for the loans he took out between October 2015 and 
November 2016. The monthly credit expenditure Sunny recorded varied significantly 
throughout this same period and was as low as £83 and as high as £787.
Sunny also carried out credit checks but it hasn't provided the results of the credit checks it 
carried for any of the loans. But I've seen information provided by Mr M, which gives me 
some insight into his other borrowing.
In the period before loan 4, I've seen that Mr M paid around £750 to at least four other high-
cost short-term (HCST) lenders - with Mr M having multiple loans outstanding with one of the 
other lenders, meaning he made around nine HCST repayments in September 2015. In 
October 2015, Mr M again made nine HCST repayments (not including Sunny) totalling over 
£1,000, again to four different lenders.
I think proportionate checks would've likely revealed that Mr M was relying heavily on HCST 
credit and had been for some time. Had Sunny carried out proportionate checks and seen 
how frequently Mr M was accessing HCST credit, I think it would've realised it was unlikely 
Mr M could've repaid loan 4, or any subsequent loan, in a sustainable manner. From what 
I've seen, Mr M was having to borrow to repay his existing loans, which wasn't a sustainable 
situation.
This remained the case up to when Mr M took out loan 12, except that by this time Mr M was 
repaying even greater sums to a larger number of lenders.
I'm therefore upholding the complaint about loans 4 to 12 as I think proportionate checks 
would most likely have shown Sunny these loans were not sustainably affordable for Mr M.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunny's lending history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldn't have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ms case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
13. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised (from the pattern of lending alone) that
Mr M was not managing to repay his loans sustainably. Mr M had taken out 12 loans 
within 12 months and had been indebted to Sunny that whole time. So Sunny ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not Mr M was having to borrow further to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ms 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.Mr Ms first loan was for £100 and loan 13 was for £450. At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that Mr M was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing need.
From loan 13 onwards Mr M continued to be provided with overlapping loans or with 
new loans within days or weeks of settling a previous one. 
Mr M wasn't making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 35 was 
taken out 28 months after Mr Ms first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr M had paid 
large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 
13 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding the complaint about loans 13 to 35 as well as loans 4 to 12.
Putting things right
Sunny should refund the interest and charges Mr M paid on loans 4 to 35. It should add 8% 
simple interest to this refund, from when Mr M paid the interest and charges (if he did) until 
the date of settlement. Sunny should also remove any adverse information it has recorded 
about loans 4 to 12 from Mr M's credit file. And as the number of loans is in itself adverse 
information, Sunny should remove all information about loans 13 to 35 from Mr M's credit 
file.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mr M's complaint in part. Elevate Credit International 
Limited must put things right by taking the steps set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 May 2020.
