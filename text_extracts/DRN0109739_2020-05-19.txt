K821x#15complaint
Mrs S says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny lent to her irresponsibly. 
She says the high interest she had to pay to Sunny caused her financial problems and she 
couldnt afford to pay her monthly bills. She thinks Sunny shouldnt  have lend to her. 
background
This complaint is about one running  credit account and a further 25 instalment loans Sunny 
provided to Mrs S between January 2014 and May 2017. Ive included a table that shows 
some of the information  Sunny has provided  about the lending at the end of this decision. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She thought that all of the lending except 
loans 18 and 19 - because of a significant break in lending  before loan 18 - should be 
upheld. She thought that the consumer was having  problems  manging her money for loans 
1 to 6 and loans 20 to 23. She thought  the lending pattern itself was harmful for loans 7 to 17 
and loans 24 to 26.
Mrs S agreed with the adjudicators findings. Sunny agreed in part. It offered to pay 
compensation in respect of loans 8 to 18 and 21 to 26. Mrs S didnt agree with Sunnys offer 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN01097392And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs S complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mrs S complaint 
in part and have explained why below.
Sunny has made an offer to pay compensation in respect of loans 8 to 18 and 21 to 26. Most 
of this is in line with what our adjudicator said. But its made  an offer of compensation in 
respect of loan 18 which our adjudicator didnt think should be upheld.  Even  though there 
was a large break from when this loan started from the end of loan 17. There may be some 
confusion as Sunny has numbered  its loans  differently. It has called both the running credit 
and the first instalment loan number 1. So Ive looked at loan 18 below (Which would be 
Sunnys reference  to loan 17).  
loans 8 to 17 and loans  22 to 26
I have no reason to question Sunnys  offers in respect of loans 8 to 17 and loans 22 to 26. 
And I agree it should pay compensation for this lending. So I wont be making a substantive 
decision about these  loans. 
loans 18 and 19
I dont think loans 18 and 19 should  be upheld. Mrs S didnt disagree with our adjudicators 
opinion not to uphold these loans.  And Im not certain Sunny intended to make an offer of 
compensation about loan 18. But given that Mrs S didnt disagree with what our adjudicator 
said I wont comment substantively on these loans.  
But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mrs S had with Sunny. So they are 
something I will take into account when considering the other  loans she took. Ill look at 
loans 1 to 7 and loans  20 and 21 in more detail below.   
  
loans 1 to 6 and loans 20 and 21
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 1 wouldve been  for Sunny to 
have found out about Mrs S income  and expenditure  and other short term lending. And 
going forward it shouldve  made a full review of Mrs S circumstances.  It should also have 
done this for loans  20 and 21. As far as I can see Sunny didnt make these checks.  
It if had done the checks  it would most likely have shown that Mrs S was having  problems  
managing her money. This is because  she was using other short  term lenders and was 
borrowing and repaying significant amounts to these. Because of this I dont think she was 
able to sustainably  repay her loans. Sunny wouldve seen this if it had made proportionate 
checks and not lent to her. 
Ref: DRN01097393loan 7
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loan 7 because  I dont 
think that it is necessary  to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys  lending history 
with Mrs S, with a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have 
seen that further  lending  was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  And so Sunny shouldve  
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
I think that this point was reached by loan 7. I say this because:
at loan 7 Sunny ought to have  realised Mrs S was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Mrs S had taken out 7 loans within 14 months. So Sunny ought  to have 
realised she was probably borrowing further to cover  the hole repaying her previous 
loans were leaving in her finances  and that her indebtedness  was increasing 
unsustainably;
over loans 7 to 17 and loans 22 to 26 Mrs S was provided with a new loan within a 
very short time after settling a previous  one. At times she had more  than one loan 
running at once; 
Mrs S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 26 was 
taken out over three years after Mrs S first. And it was for a larger  amount. And even 
with the break in lending Mrs S had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  
service a debt to Sunny over an extended  period;
I think that Mrs S lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs S indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time;
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mrs S borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans;
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 1 to 17 and loans 20 to 26 and Sunny should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs S paid on 1 to 17 and loans 20 to 26
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 1 to 6 and loans 20 and 21 from Mrs S 
credit file;
the number  of loans taken over loans 7 to 17 and 22 to 26 means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about loans 7 to 17 and 22 to 26 
should be removed  from Mrs S credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs S a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN01097394my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mrs S complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs S to accept 
or reject my decision before [date].
