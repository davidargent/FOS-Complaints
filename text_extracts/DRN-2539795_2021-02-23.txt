The complaint
Mr H complains as a director of D, a limited company, about WorldPay (UK) Limiteds 
(WorldPay) delay in notifying D of arrears on its account. D wants WorldPay to waive the 
outstanding fees.  
What happened
WorldPay set up an account for D to use their online payment service. D are charged a 
monthly fee to use this service. Mr H says one of the payments didnt go through in 2017 so 
he spoke with WorldPay and was told the issue had been resolved. Mr H says D then 
stopped receiving invoices and he assumed the fee for this service had been incorporated 
into the fee D was paying WorldPay for other services. D then received a letter from 
WorldPay in 2020 claiming arrears for the online payment service. 
  
D complained and WorldPay responded and said the arrears are valid as they represent 
their charges for the services made available to D. They accepted they couldve done more 
to make D aware of the outstanding charges prior to sending their letter. They agreed there 
was a significant period before contact was made regarding the debt on the account so they 
upheld the complaint. They offered to remove six invoices  totalling £145.92 - from the 
outstanding balance of £605.46. So, the outstanding balance was reduced to £459.54. 
  
Our investigator looked into things for D and thought WorldPays offer was fair and 
reasonable. WorldPay told us invoices were always sent to D and the balance of the arrears 
increased due to returned invoices. D disagreed so the matter has come to me for a 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided WorldPays offer to reduce the arrears is a fair way to resolve 
matters and so I dont uphold Ds complaint in this matter. Ill explain why I have made this 
decision. 
Firstly, Ive looked at the service given to D including the handling of the account. The key 
facts about this complaint arent in dispute. WorldPay have admitted they got things wrong in 
not making D aware sooner that there are arrears on its account. The only issue I have to 
decide is whether the reduction offered by WorldPay is fair and reasonable.
I think its right that WorldPay should compensate D for the inconvenience caused by their 
poor service. The problem started in 2017 and, from the information Ive seen, D arent made 
aware of the increasing arrears until 2020. 
While theres no evidence of an impact to D during this period, theyre understandably 
caused inconvenience when receiving an invoice which has accrued over such a significant 
period.   
I note Mr H feels the arrears should be waived but I wont be asking WorldPay to do this. I 
can see from information provided by WorldPay that the online payment service they provide 
D attracts a fee. This isnt disputed by either party. Mr H has told us that this service wasnt 
withdrawn when the fees werent being paid so he was unaware there was an issue. The 
important point here is that Mr H accepts he was still receiving the service during the time 
the arrears are accruing. Theres no evidence that D no longer required this service or asked 
to end this service, so they have continued to use the service provided. And, it is for this 
reason that I think it would be unfair and unreasonable to ask WorldPay to waive the fees 
over the full period the arrears have accrued. 
WorldPay have provided a list of the invoices they sent and they say they received several 
returned invoices. Mr H says D didnt receive any invoices over the period the arrears 
accrued. So, while I do accept WorldPay shouldve done more to bring the arrears to Ds 
attention, Mr H was still aware during this period that the online payment service D is 
receiving does include a fee. 
Taking this all into account, I think there has been an error here by WorldPay in not 
communicating the arrears to D until 2020. At this point, there is inconvenience to D in being 
expected to pay arrears when it wasnt aware of the amount for a significant length of time. I 
think the reduction of £145.92 from the arrears is fair and reasonable in the circumstances 
and reflects the inconvenience caused. 
   
In summary, I dont uphold Ds complaint in this matter and agree the compensation offered 
by WorldPay is a fair and reasonable way to resolve this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask D to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 March 2021.
