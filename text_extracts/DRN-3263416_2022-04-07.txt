The complaint
Mr P complains about how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA implemented new rules on 
authenticating customers. He says what they did meant he lost access to his PayPal 
account.
What happened
Mr P says that when PayPal made changes to the way a customer accesses their account, 
he lost access. The changes meant he could no longer access his account by simply using 
his email address and entering his password; he was required to also confirm a telephone 
number linked to his account by receiving a code to it.
Although Mr P does use a mobile phone and had previously linked that number to his 
PayPal account, he was finding that the code was expiring before it was received. He spoke 
with his mobile phone operator who told him PayPals SMS messages needed a long 
processing time.
When he contacted PayPal in October 2020 via chat services and social media seeking to 
resolve the problem, they were unable to add a landline number to his account for him to use 
for authenticating instead. Considering this, he suggested that PayPal either; send a time 
limited code to him by email, adopt a second password, or allow him to bypass this layer of 
authentication until the issue with the SMS messages had been resolved. As PayPal didnt 
adopt these suggestions or offer another resolution, Mr P says he was prevented from 
retrieving the funds in his account (approximately £100).
PayPal told Mr P they could see no reason why the SMS messages werent reaching him in 
time. They suggested he call to speak with an agent, but he said hed already tried that a 
number of times and couldnt get through. He said when he called he repeatedly received a 
message directing him back to the website. As he didnt feel he was getting anywhere with 
PayPal, Mr P complained.
PayPal responded to Mr Ps complaint on 14 January 2021. They said:
Theyd made changes to the way customers access their accounts in response to the 
Payment Services Directive (PSD2) which brought in a requirement for payment 
service providers to implement two-factor or strong customer authentication (SCA);
Mr P had attempted to login to his account on 21 and 23 October 2020, however, it 
was stopped by the security system and he was required to complete SCA;
As theyll sometimes require Mr P to receive and enter a one-time passcode (OTP) to 
a phone number registered with them, its important his phone details are kept up to 
date; and
They didnt accept Mr Ps complaint because theyd sent OTPs to his mobile number 
in October 2020 and couldnt identify any issues that would have caused a delay in 
him receiving those messages.
Mr P remained dissatisfied as PayPal hadnt offered him any alternative way of accessing 
his account.
What PayPal told us
PayPal told us they understand Mr P to be not willing to complete the SCA process but 
they have no choice but to implement the requirements of PSD2. They said SCA is more 
likely to be triggered if a consumer attempts to access their account via a virtual private 
network (VPN), so Mr P can reduce the number of times hes asked to complete SCA if he 
avoids using a VPN.
Our investigators view
Our investigator upheld Mr Ps complaint. He said that whilst PayPal hadnt acted unfairly by 
introducing SCA, they should have done more to help Mr P when he told them he was 
struggling to receive the authentication codes or OTPs to his mobile phone number. The 
investigator cited the Financial Conduct Authoritys (FCAs) guidance on the implementation 
of SCA which sets out their expectation that payment service providers (PSPs), like PayPal, 
will develop SCA solutions that work for all groups of customers.
The investigator said that PayPal hadnt offered Mr P any viable alternatives for accessing 
his account beyond telling him that he could reduce the number of times hes asked to 
complete the SCA step if he avoids using VPNs, and he didnt think this was fair.
To put things right the investigator said PayPal should pay Mr P £100 compensation for the 
distress and inconvenience caused by their poor service, and offer Mr P another method to 
authenticate which doesnt rely on his mobile phone.
Responses to the view
Mr P asked the investigator to amend his recommendations to make it clearer that PayPal 
ought to pay him £100 compensation and return to him the funds still held in his PayPal 
account.
PayPal didnt accept what the investigator had said. They said theyd already offered Mr P 
multiple viable alternatives but Mr P had refused to use these options to access his 
account and funds. PayPal directed us to a page of their website which explains SCA and 
includes the following:
If we need to ask you for a one-time passcode we can send it by SMS to your 
mobile phone number or via phone call to your landline, so your payment or login 
wont be delayed.
The page goes on to explain that PayPal also use device recognition, so an OTP isnt 
always necessary:
Most times, we'll be able to verify your identity using the PayPal password youve 
typed and the device you're using (if its one of your usual devices). So, you may 
continue to login to your PayPal account or pay with PayPal as usual, using your 
email address and your PayPal password.
The page also explains that customers can complete SCA: via the PayPal app; by entering 
an OTP sent to a phone number; or by generating an OTP with a third-party authenticator 
app.Mr P maintained that PayPal hadnt offered him an alternative means of verifying his identity 
and had only offered to send the OTPs to his mobile phone, which wasnt working for him.
As no agreement could be reached, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on 7 December 2021. I began by setting out the 
considerations I thought relevant to my decision. I wrote:
Im required to determine this complaint by reference to what I consider to be fair 
and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. When considering what is fair 
and reasonable, I am required to take into account: relevant law and regulations; 
regulators' rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where appropriate, 
what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time.
So, Ill start by setting out what I have identified as the relevant considerations to 
deciding what is fair and reasonable in this case.
The Payment Services Regulations 2017 (PSRs) Reg. 100, which came into force on 
14 September 2019, says that a payment service provider (PSP) must apply strong 
customer authentication where a payment service user accesses its payment 
account online, initiates an electronic payment transaction; or carries out any action 
through a remote channel which may imply a risk of payment fraud or other abuses.
SCA is defined in the PSRs. It means:
authentication based on the use of two or more elements that are 
independent, in that the breach of one element does not compromise the 
reliability of any other element, and designed in such a way as to protect the 
confidentiality of the authentication data, with the elements falling into two or 
more of the following categories
(a) something known only by the payment service user (knowledge);
(b) something held only by the payment service user (possession);
(c) something inherent to the payment service user (inherence);
Another relevant consideration is the SCA implementation guidance issued by the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in its document Payment Service and Electronic 
Money  Our Approach (June 2019) and related statements.
The FCAs guidance document says:
 it may be necessary for a PSP to provide different methods of 
authentication, to comply with their obligation to apply strong customer 
authentication in line with [PSD2]. For example, not all payment service users 
will possess a mobile phone or smart phone and payments may be made in 
areas without mobile phone reception. PSPs must provide a viable means to 
strongly authenticate customers in these situations. (my emphasis)
In its statement of expectations published in September 2019, the FCA also said:
We expect firms to develop SCA solutions that work for all groups of 
consumers. This means that you may need to provide several different 
methods of authentication for your customers. This includes methods that dont rely on mobile phones, to cater for consumers who dont have, or wont 
want to use, a mobile phone.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator and for broadly 
the same reasons.
I think the above relevant considerations mean that PayPal were required to 
implement SCA, and so I dont think theyve acted unfairly by doing that. The 
intention of the new SCA rules is to protect both businesses and consumers from 
fraudulent activity and that is, of course, to be welcomed. The FCAs guidance also 
makes it clear that processes reliant on mobile phone ownership wont be suitable for 
all customers and PSPs must provide viable alternatives.
PayPal have shown that they do offer a range of SCA compliant verification options. 
But Ive seen no evidence that when Mr P let PayPal know he was having difficulty 
receiving their OTPs to his mobile phone, they helped him towards using one of the 
alternatives they offer.
Ive read through the electronic exchanges PayPal had with Mr P from October to 
December 2020 and I can see that he was seeking to update his account so that his 
landline telephone number could be used for SCA. But I dont think PayPal did 
enough to help him achieve that.
PayPal have suggested that Mr P is not willing to complete the extra authentication 
step that SCA involves. I dont agree thats the case. Indeed, Mr P made some 
suggestions for an alternative extra step when he was corresponding with PayPal. 
So, I think its more likely than not hed have accepted authenticating using his 
landline if PayPal had made that solution possible.
Because of his frustrating exchanges with PayPal Mr P abandoned further attempts 
to access his PayPal account. If hed persisted in trying, I accept its possible that at 
some point between October 2020 and now hed have found whatever was causing 
PayPals SMS messages to be delayed has resolved. However, in the circumstances 
I dont think it was incumbent on him to keep trying.
By not helping Mr P to access his account using another of their options for 
authentication, I think PayPal caused Mr P distress and inconvenience as he was 
unable to use his account or remove his funds (approximately, £100). So, overall, I 
dont think PayPal treated Mr P fairly and reasonably. And I think its right that PayPal 
pay him £100 compensation and, moving forward, enable Mr P to complete the SCA 
process without reliance on his mobile phone if he is still finding the OTPs have 
expired before receipt.
Responses to the provisional decision
PayPal agreed to pay Mr P £100 and advised that if he was still having trouble receiving 
OTPs to his mobile phone, he could try using an authenticator app which can be 
downloaded to a desktop personal computer or smart phone and generates a passcode 
which can be used for two factor authentication (SCA). They also told our service that there is currently an issue with authenticating using a landline telephone number, and they dont 
have a clear timeframe for when that will be resolved.
Mr P explained hes never used a VPN and said he couldnt receive PayPals text messages 
because his network provider interpreted them as spam. He explained, PayPal have 
neither disabled the SCA option nor introduced an alternative means of accessing the 
account!. He also said he has no desire to continue using PayPals services.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I see no reason to depart from what I said in my provisional decision. I 
remain of the view that whilst PayPal did nothing wrong by implementing SCA - an important 
regulatory measure designed to protect both PayPal and customers from fraud - PayPal 
failed to help Mr P access his account using another of their options for strong customer 
authentication (landline or authenticator app) when it became clear OTP to mobile wasnt 
working.
Mr P has told me that he no longer wants to be PayPals customer because of his poor 
experience of their service. So, although I would have directed PayPal to help Mr P to 
complete the SCA process using one of their available alternative options to mobile phone if 
he still couldnt successfully receive OTPs to his mobile phone, I dont think I now need to 
make any direction about what authentication options PayPal should offer him going 
forwards. However, they should still, if he wishes to end his relationship with them, assist 
him with completing authentication so that he may withdraw any remaining balance he has in 
his PayPal account.
Putting things right
Ways of strongly authenticating customers which dont rely on the payment service user 
having a mobile phone or mobile device do exist and the relevant guidance says alternatives 
should be offered. So, I think it was unfair and unreasonable of PayPal not to help Mr P 
towards one of the alternatives they offer when he was struggling to receive OTPs to his 
mobile phone. To compensate him for the distress and inconvenience caused by this poor 
service I direct PayPal, if theyve not already done so, to pay Mr P £100.
PayPal should also assist Mr P with completing authentication using his mobile phone or, if 
hes still having difficulty receiving OTPs by SMS, using an authenticator app, so that he may 
withdraw any remaining balance he has in his PayPal account.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ps complaint. PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA should 
put things right in the way Ive set out in the Putting things right  what PayPal needs to do 
section of this decision.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 May 2022.
