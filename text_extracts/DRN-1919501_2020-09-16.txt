DRN-1919501
The complaint
Mr B complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Northridge Finance Limited was misrepresented to him.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr B is clearly unhappy with the fuel efficiency of the car that was supplied to him 
and he says that he only achieves 23.7 miles per gallon when the cars official miles 
per gallon is 43.5 to 46.5 (with a real miles per gallon of 30.2);
Northridge Finance says that the dealers advert for the car would have included a 
warning that: MPG figures are obtained in laboratory testing and intended for 
comparisons between vehicles. Please be aware they're not intended to represent 
real world efficiency;
a cars fuel efficiency is affected by many factors including the type of journey, driving 
style, weather conditions and maintenance of the car so any figures given for miles 
per gallon can only be indicative;
Mr B is achieving 23.7 miles per gallon against an expected realistic miles per gallon 
of 30.2 and I dont consider that the difference is enough to show that the car was 
misrepresented to him;
if fuel efficiency was an important consideration for Mr B I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him to have done more research about that issue before he 
entered into the hire purchase agreement;
the car that was supplied to Mr B was the car that he test-drove and it was properly 
described in the hire purchase agreement;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the car is faulty or that it wasnt of satisfactory 
quality when it was supplied to Mr B;
when Mr B complained to Northridge Finance it offered him a preferential settlement 
figure based on a full rebate of interest;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car was 
misrepresented to Mr B and I consider that Northridge Finances response to his 
compliant was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Northridge Finance to replace the car, to pay any compensation to Mr B or to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 October 2020.
