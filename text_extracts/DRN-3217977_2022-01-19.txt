The complaint
Mr Y has complained through a representative that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA wont 
close his account and remove his bank details from their system.   
What happened
Mr Ys representative opened a PayPal account for him when he was under 18. He told 
PayPal this when Mr Y turned 18. PayPal locked and limited the account. Initially, Mr Y 
couldnt get the money that was left in the account, but he managed to do this following a 
complaint to us. Mr Ys representative then asked PayPal to close the account and remove 
Mr Ys bank details from their system. PayPal have refused to do this and referred to their 
terms and conditions. Mr Ys representative complained to PayPal on his behalf about this, 
but PayPal refused to alter their stance.  
Mr Ys representative asked us to consider a complaint against PayPal for Mr Y. One of our 
investigators considered Mr Ys complaint and upheld it. He said that PayPal hadnt given a 
good reason why they couldnt just close Mr Ys account and remove his bank details. And 
he recommended they do this. 
PayPal disagree with our investigator. Theyve said they have discretion to make commercial 
decisions, which cannot be challenged by the Financial Ombudsman Service.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal have referred to their terms and conditions, which do give them the option to limit Mr 
Ys account. But they also give them the option to close it. Mr Y has asked them to close it 
and our investigator has asked PayPal to explain why they cant do this. PayPal havent 
explained why. And, when our investigator recommended they do this, they have simply said 
it is a commercial decision the Financial Ombudsman Service cant challenge. 
I think PayPal are wrong and it is with in my remit to direct PayPal to take action, which I 
think is appropriate as a fair and reasonable outcome to Mr Ys complaint, even if it means 
overturning a commercial decision. I may not interfere with a decision such as this if Im 
satisfied it is a legitimate exercise of PayPals commercial discretion, but in this instance, I 
dont. This is because PayPal have to treat Mr Y fairly as their customer and cant hide 
behind the fact they have made a commercial decision to avoid doing this. I dont think they 
have treated Mr Y fairly by simply ignoring his request to close his account and remove his 
bank details without giving a good reason. And I cant see any good reason why they cant 
do this. After all, it is clearly something their terms and conditions allow. 
Putting things right
It therefore follows that I think the fair and reasonable outcome to this complaint is for me to 
direct PayPal to permanently close Mr Ys account with them (the account this complaint is 
the subject of). They must also permanently delete any bank account and credit or debit card 
details they hold for Mr Y from their systems.  PayPal must also write to Mr Y confirming they 
have done this. 
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ys complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to permanently close 
Mr Ys account with them. I also direct them to permanently delete any bank account and 
credit or debit card details they hold for Mr Y from their systems. I also direct PayPal 
(Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to write to Mr Y confirming they have done this.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2022.
