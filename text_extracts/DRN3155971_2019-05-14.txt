K820x#14complaint
Mr Fs unhappy  that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has closed his account. 
background
Mr F says that after using his PayPal  account  for transactions while he was in Europe some  
were flagged as suspicious.  When he returned  home PayPal said he could no longer use its 
services as hed filed cases that didnt align  with its policies or were contrary to its terms. 
Hes unhappy with this as he says the transactions were flagged  by PayPals system not by 
him. It later said he was using the account for restricted activities.  Mr F denies  this and says 
its never been explained what  these  are. His accounts blocked and a substantial amount of 
money is being held for six months.  Hes lost business as a result  and wants his account  
reactivated and compensation.  He says his familys accounts have also been affected.
PayPal said in its final response that it can at any time and without liability, suspend, block, 
limit or close an account entirely or for any reason. And its satisfied that all actions taken in 
Mr Fs case  were  correct  and in accordance with its agreed terms of use. It doesnt have an 
obligation to disclose the reasons for this decision.
Our investigator felt this complaint  shouldnt be upheld.  He said:
As a commercial organisation PayPal can determine who it wishes to provide 
services to and on what terms. Here its provided confidential information about its 
reasoning. Its in accordance with its user agreement. Theres no evidence of 
discrimination or of it following incorrect procedures.
Mr Fs account  was blocked  for risk reasons. PayPal is entitled  under the terms of the 
user agreement  to withhold money for a time. And its reasonable for it to do so until 
the period when  claims can be made  against  Mr F has passed.
If Mr Fs family are concerned about their accounts also being affected they will have 
to raise these issues as separate complaints with PayPal.
Mr F doesnt agree and has asked for an ombudsman review.  He says he would like more 
clarity on what PayPal says he did wrong.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I agree  with the investigators conclusions for the same reasons.
The terms of PayPals  user agreement,  which Mr F wouldve accepted  when he first used its 
service, make clear it can close his account  if its wishes to do so.
Here PayPal decided  to end its relationship with Mr F as it was entitled to do. It also retained 
some of his money  until the period has passed when claims could be made against him. 
Thats all fair, reasonable  and in line with the terms of his user agreement.
Ref: DRN31559712I understand Mr Fs frustration at not being  given a detailed reason for what  has happened. 
But PayPal isnt obliged  to do so. 
Overall, although I recognise  Mr Fs strength of feeling, I dont think PayPal has done  
anything wrong. And I dont think I can fairly  or reasonably now require it to reactivate  his 
account or pay him any compensation  as hed like.
Mr F says his familys PayPal accounts  have  also been affected by whats  happened to him. 
But I can only deal with Mr Fs account  in this complaint.  As the investigator has said,  if his 
family members are unhappy with the service  theyve received from PayPal they will need  to 
take that up with PayPal  directly.
I dont see any reason to change  the proposed outcome in this case.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 June  2019.
