The complaint
Mr L complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA wont refund payments he didnt 
authorise from his PayPal credit card.
What happened
Mr L says he noticed that the balance on the card account was higher than he expected. He 
was unhappy to be told that as there was no payment method associated with the specific 
merchant involved here and many others, funding had come from his PayPal card account. 
He wants these payments refunded and to be compensated for the anxiety and the financial 
impact this caused. 
PayPal said it hadnt made a mistake. A payment card associated with a billing agreement 
for this merchant had been removed from Mr Ls account on 18 January 2022. There was no 
preferred card and so it followed its terms and conditions and applied the charges to the 
PayPal account. During a webchat with Mr L on 22 March 2022 it explained this and how he 
could add a preferred card again. It said that it was unable to transfer these payments to his 
debit card as they had already completed. But that in order to bring the matter to a close and 
reflect his value as a customer it offered to pay him £250.
Our investigator didnt recommend that PayPal do anything further as it hadnt made a 
mistake. And its offer in any event was reasonable in view of what Mr L said about the 
impact for him.
Mr L didnt agree and wanted his complaint to be reviewed. He said that we should examine 
the evidence carefully and screenshots he had provided to us in November 2022 when he 
tried to add a credit card as a default to pay this merchant. Mr L says that this shows that he 
couldnt change the card. He profoundly disagreed with our assessment and said that there 
is insufficient compensation. He found dealing with the PayPal system confusing and said it 
should be his next registered card, not that of PayPal applied as a payment method. He sent 
in further comments outlining his complaint again and explained that this had happened with 
another merchant. Mr L stressed that he hadnt budgeted for these payments, and they were 
not made with his explicit consent. He wants them refunded together with a payment of 
appropriate compensation for his time and the financial and emotional distress including to 
his family. PayPal hadnt done anything until hed been in touch with this service.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the screenshots provided by Mr L, and I dont have reason to doubt that he 
was then trying to add a payment card as a preferred method to pay a specific merchant. At 
that time, he received a message Were sorry we cant change your payment option right 
now. Please try again later. Im afraid I dont find this to be conclusive evidence that he 
wasnt able to use another card other than his PayPal credit card as a preferred method. I 
say this because he was able to do that in the past and there may have been temporary 
system problems. I dont see evidence he followed this up or tried at different times.
I understand that Mr L has multiple billing agreements with a number of merchants. Hes 
shown from the screen shot provided that he ought to be able to set a different preferred 
card for each one. When a preferred card is removed as happened in January 2022 there is 
a default hierarchy so that PayPal can allocate a payment request to a card. That is set out 
in its user agreement. I appreciate that Mr L doesnt accept this and believes that PayPal 
should have asked for authorisation before proceeding. And that it shouldnt prioritise its own 
card without explicit agreement.
While I understand his points Im afraid its not the role of this service to say what business 
processes should be. And so, to say that PayPal should have contacted Mr L in the way he 
wanted. In my view he gave authorisation when he signed up to the PayPal service and is 
fairly bound by the terms and conditions. Similarly, I consider that when he made a payment 
request through a merchant where no preferred payment method is set, PayPal was able to 
deem that he had authorised a payment through his PayPal credit card account. The 
alternative may have been that a payment failed which would likely be inconvenient. And 
when a new payment card is added I dont see that PayPal needs to use that as a default for 
payments. How it deals with that is a matter for it to decide upon and which again is 
consistent with its terms and conditions.
Mr L didnt intend the payments to go to this account. And that was particularly because as I 
understand it he wanted to use a payment to his credit card account to repay a promotional 
balance that was coming to an end. The priority was instead given to balances which at that 
time were subject to interest. I dont consider that these payments should be refunded as   
Mr L wants as I dont think PayPal has made a mistake. But in recognition of what happened 
PayPal has offered to pay Mr L a gesture of goodwill and which our investigator was 
referring to in his view. For the reasons Ive given I dont have a basis to require PayPal to 
do anything more that pay this to resolve the complaint.
My final decision
PayPal has made an offer to resolve this complaint which I think is fair in all the 
circumstances. So, my decision is that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA pay Mr L £250 as it 
has offered to do.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2023.
