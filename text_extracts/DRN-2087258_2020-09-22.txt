Our adjudicator reviewed Mr Ts complaint and they explained we couldnt consider loans 1 
and 2 due to the time that had passed since they were taken out. But the adjudicator thought 
that the loans from loan 5 onwards should be upheld. The adjudicator said this because they 
thought the overall pattern of Mr Ts borrowing indicated he was reliant on these loans and 
the borrowing was becoming unsustainable. 
Morses didnt agree and asked for an ombudsmans decision. So, the complaint has been 
passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr T 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much was being lent, the 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Morses was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint. Having done so, I am partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think we could look into loans 1 and 2 and they didnt uphold Mr Ts 
complaint about loans 3 to 5. Mr T hasnt provided any further evidence or arguments for us 
to consider, so I wont be making any further findings on these loans because they no longer 
appear to be in dispute. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Morses lending history with Mr T, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Morses should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Morses should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Ts case, like the adjudicator, I think that this point was 
reached by loan 5. I say this because:
At this point Morses ought to have realised Mr T was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr T had taken out at least four loans in 14 months. So, it should have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr T was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ts 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.Mr Ts second loan was for £500 and loan 5 was for £200 but it was taken out whilst 
loan 4 was still running so the amount he was paying weekly had increased. At this 
point Morses ought to have known it was unlikely Mr T was borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 5 onwards Mr T was provided with a new loan either on the same day he 
repaid a previous one  or shortly afterwards. Some of the loans were running 
concurrently which would have been increasing his weekly outgoings. 
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Morses. Loan 10 was 
taken out at least four years after Mr Ts second loan, and possibly even more after 
his first loan. Mr T had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect; service a debt to 
Morses over an extended period.
I think that Mr T lost out because Morses continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The number of loans and the length of time over which Mr T borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ts ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding Mr Ts complaint about loan 5 onwards. Morses should put things right as 
laid out below.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans 5 to 10;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 5 to 10 should be removed from   
Mr Ts credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses Club PLC to take off tax from this interest. Morses Club 
PLC must give Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
Im partially upholding Mr Ts complaint. Morses Club PLC should put things right as set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 October 2020.
