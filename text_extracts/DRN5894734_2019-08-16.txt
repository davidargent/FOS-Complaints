K821x#15complaint
Mr H says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He 
says that he was in a debt spiral and the loans werent affordable. He says Sunny shouldve 
made better checks and it wouldve seen  this and not lent to him. 
background
Our adjudicator thought the complaint shouldnt be upheld.  Sunny disagreed  with the 
adjudicators opinion. The complaint was then passed to me. 
I issued my provisional decision saying that Mr Hs complaint should  be upheld  in part. A 
copy of the background to the complaint  and my provisional findings, are attached and form 
part of this final decision. 
Sunny, and Mr H, received my provisional  decision. Mr H agreed with my provisional 
decision. Sunny didnt  have anything to add after it had seen it. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Sunny and Mr H didnt raise any new points  after receiving my provisional decision. So Ive 
reached the same conclusions I reached before, for the same reasons.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 6 to 38;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 means  any information  recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  6 to 38 should  be removed from Mr Hs credit  file.
If Mr H still owes  Sunny any of the principal  balance he borrowed on any of his loans Sunny 
should remove all the interest and charges applied to the outstanding balance. Sunny  should  
then re-work the account as if all payments made by Mr H went  towards  the principal. But 
importantly, Sunny needs to make sure that Mr H doesnt repay more than the principal  
amount borrowed.  
If after doing this Mr H hasnt repaid  the principal he borrowed Sunny can deduct this from 
the remainder of the compensation.  If Mr H has already paid enough to repay the principal 
then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple*  interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement
And if Sunny no longer  owns any of the debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the 
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr H.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN58947342my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Hs complaint.
Elevate Credit International should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 September  2019.

Ref: DRN58947343extract from my provisional  decision
This complaint is about  38 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr H between November 2015 and 
November 2017. Ive included a table at the end of this decision  which contains a summary  of Mr Hs 
lending with Sunny. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. He said that Sunny had made  proportionate checks for 
loans 1 to 4 and so it was acting reasonably  when it approved these  loans. He didnt think Sunny  had 
made proportionate checks for loans 5 to 38. But he thought  that if it had made better checks it 
wouldve seen that the loans were  affordable.  
Mr H disagreed with the adjudicators opinion  so the complaint  has been passed to me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to provisionally decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website  and Ive 
taken this into account in deciding  Mr Hs case. 
Ive provisionally decided to uphold  Mr Hs complaint  in part and have explained  why below.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr H could repay his loans 
in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and Mr Hs income and expenditure.  With this in mind, in the early stages  of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  indicate that a lender should fairly and reasonably have done more to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These would include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion of their 
income 
the amount, or amounts,  due to be repaid are higher  
there is a larger number  or higher frequency of loans 
the period of time during which a customer and business have a lending relationship is long
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind,  I think that there are three key questions for me to consider in order to fairly 
and reasonably determine  Mr Hs complaint. These questions are:
1.Did Sunny, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that Mr H would be able to repay in a sustainable  way? If not, would those  checks have 
shown that Mr H would have  been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase  Mr Hs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
3.Did Sunny act unfairly or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought about  all of these questions and what they mean  for Mr Hs complaint.
Ref: DRN58947344did Sunny, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that Mr H would  be able to repay in a sustainable  way? If not, would those  checks have shown 
that Mr H would  have been able to do so?
Ive seen a record of the information Mr H provided  when  he completed his loan applications  for loans 
1 to 4. I think  it was reasonable for Sunny to say that Mr H could  sustainably make the repayments to 
the first four loans. 
I havent seen any further information that shows its likely Sunny was made  aware of any financial 
problems Mr H mightve been having. Or anything that wouldve prompted it to investigate Mr Hs 
circumstances further. So I think it was reasonable for Sunny to rely on the information it obtained.
So overall, in these circumstances, I think the assessments  Sunny did for loans 1 to 4 were 
proportionate. And I think its decisions to approve these loans were  reasonable.
But by loan 5 Mr H had taken a number  of loans  in quick succession. And he was still making the 
repayments to loan 1. I think Sunny shouldve realised that Mr H was having  problems  managing  his 
money. 
So to do a proportionate  check I think it shouldve  fully reviewed Mr Hs finances. This was to make 
sure Mr H was in position to make the repayments sustainably. As far as I can see Sunny  didnt do 
this. So I need to think about what Sunny wouldve seen if it had carried out proportionate checks. 
Mr H has provided some information about his financial  circumstances which  includes his bank 
statements. But having looked at these, I cant safely say that Sunny wouldve seen that Mr H couldnt 
sustainably make  the repayments to loan 5. So Im not upholding his complaint  about this loan. 
I havent recreated  individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans  6 to 38 because I dont think  
that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Hs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise  harmful?
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of lending.  Ive looked to see if there was a point at which  Sunny 
should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided any further lending. Given the particular  
circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say this because:
the amounts  Mr H was repaying were  generally  increasing. This is because  he was taking out 
further loans when existing loans  were still running. For example  when he took out loan 6 he 
was still making  the repayments to loans  1 to 5. This pattern continued throughout the lending 
relationship. At some  points Mr H was making repayments to around 10 loans at the same 
time.  
Sunny ought to have realised it was it was more likely than not Mr H was having to borrow 
further to cover the hole repaying his previous,  and ongoing, loans were leaving in his 
finances. It also shouldve thought that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably
Mr H wasnt really reducing the amount he owed Sunny. As my table  shows Mr H borrowed 
from Sunny for over two years without a significant break in the lending. He was in effect 
paying large amounts of interest  to service  this debt over an extended period
I think  that Mr H lost out because Sunny continued to approve  loans from loan 6 onwards because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  over an extended period of time
the sheer number of loans  was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Hs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost  loans
Ref: DRN58947345So Im intending to uphold  Mr Hs complaint  about loans 6 to 38 because the overall  pattern of lending 
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and hes lost out as 
a result.
did Sunny act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about  everything provided. Having  done  so, Ive not seen anything  here that 
leads me to conclude Sunny  acted unfairly or unreasonably towards  Mr H in some other way.
