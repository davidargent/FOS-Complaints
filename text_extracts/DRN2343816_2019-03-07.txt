K820x#14complaint
Ms K complains  about R Raphael & Sons  Plc, trading as ICE Prepaid Mastercard (ICE),
regarding issues she encountered using  her travel money card abroad. She wants the
business to pay her compensation for the distress  and inconvenience she suffered and for
spoiling her holiday.
background
I set out the background  to this complaint, and my provisional findings, in a provisional 
decision issued in February 2019.  A copy of that decision is attached to this. 
In that provisional  decision, I explained  why I thought  the complaint should be upheld and 
the compensation payable by ICE should be increased.
Ms K has responded indicating that she feels that the compensation is too low, but that she 
accepts my provisional decision. 
The business has not responded to my provisional  decision, but I am aware  that it has 
contacted Ms K directly to make  payment of the settlement proposed  in my provisional 
decision. I therefore assume that the business has no further comments  to make in response  
to my provisional decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither party has put forward any new arguments  in response to my view. Ms K has 
indicated that she feels the compensation level is too low, but I addressed this in my 
provisional decision. 
I therefore adopt the reasoning and decision  of my provisional decision as my final decision. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, and in my my provisional decision,  my final decision is to 
uphold the complaint and to direct R Raphael  & Sons Plc to pay £150 compensation to Ms K 
(in addition  to the £25 previously paid).
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 April 2019.
