The complaint
Mrs F complains that CarCashPoint Limited (CarCashPoint) lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
Mrs F took out three separate fixed sum loans with CarCashPoint between September 
and November 2019. The first loan was repayable by way of 24 monthly payments of 
£311 with the total amount repayable under the agreement being £7,466. The second 
loan was repayable by way of 36 monthly payments of £200 with the total amount 
repayable under the agreement being £7,217. The third loan was repayable by way of 36 
monthly payments of £97 with the total amount repayable under the agreement being 
£2,736. 
Each of the loans were settled within a few weeks of being taken out.  
Mrs F says all three loans were made irresponsibly as she was already struggling 
financially. 
CarCashPoint didnt agree. It said it had reviewed her income and expenditure when she 
made the application and had checked her credit file. And based on that the loan was 
affordable.
Our adjudicator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. She thought CarCashPoint 
didnt act unfairly or unreasonably by approving each of the three loans. 
But Mrs F didnt agree and so the complaint has been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
CarCashPoint will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we 
consider when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. So, 
I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about our 
approach to these complaints is set out on our website. 
Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my comments on what I think is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to take it on 
board and think about it but because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach 
what I think is the right outcome.
Before granting each of these loans, I think CarCashPoint gathered a reasonable amount of 
evidence and information from Mrs F about her ability to repay. I say this having noted the 
credit checks it carried out each time, that CarCashPoint verified Mrs Fs income from 
checking several bank statements shed given and that Mrs F had also provided a copy of 
her partners payslip. Ive seen that the checks didnt reveal any significant adverse 
information about Mrs Fs recent financial history. Mrs F had previously taken out short term 
loans but these had been settled by the time she took out the first of the three loans. 
However, just because I think CarCashPoint carried out proportionate checks for each of 
these loans, it doesnt automatically mean it made a fair lending decision on each occasion. 
So, Ive thought about what the evidence and information showed. 
Ive reviewed the information and evidence CarCashPoint gathered, as well as the 
information Mrs F provided at the time she made her application for each of these loans. 
Having done so Im satisfied that the checks that were completed showed that each 
agreement was likely to be affordable to Mrs F. From the bank statements shed provided 
CarCashPoint saw that Mrs F had an average net monthly earned income of around £1,750. 
Her total net monthly income was around £3,000. I also note that Mrs F had told 
CarCashPoint that she shared responsibility for regular outgoings with her partner. Again, 
Car Cashpoint was able to confirm this by checking the bank statements shed provided. 
CarCashPoint also used the available bank statements to verify her total monthly income 
alongside her regular living expenses. Based on that, together with each check, 
CarCashPoint calculated that Mrs F had enough disposable income. So it was likely she 
could afford the monthly repayment amount that was due under each loan. 
Our adjudicator also reviewed the available information about Mrs Fs financial situation at 
the time. She found that for the first agreement Mrs F would likely have had a disposable 
monthly income of around £2,200 per month, with a lower figure of around £1,800 per month 
for the second and third loans. 
Ive reviewed all this information, taking into account Mrs Fs overall level of household 
income, the daily outgoings and the committed expenditure shown in her bank statements, 
as well as what Mrs F has said about sharing some household costs with her partner. 
Having done so, I can see that Mrs Fs level of income and committed expenditure was 
broadly in line with the information set out in the affordability assessments that 
CarCashPoint relied on. I therefore agree that each of these loans was likely to have been 
affordable as she had sufficient disposable income to meet the monthly payments. For these 
reasons, I dont think CarCashPoint acted unfairly when approving each of the loans.
So whilst I realise this wont be the outcome Mrs F was hoping for, I dont consider Ive 
seen enough evidence or information to show that each of these logbook loans has 
been made irresponsibly. I therefore dont think CarCashPoint needs to take any further 
action.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 April 2023.
