K822xcomplaint
Ms M complains about the service and lack of support she received from National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) when she was in financial  difficulty.
background 
Ms M has a bank account with NatWest which she stopped using in August 2016.  At the 
time the account  was in arrears and Ms M kept being charged interest and overdraft  charges  
on her balance. 
In 2017, Ms M says she tried several times  to set up a repayment plan as she was in 
financial difficulty, however this didnt happen. After Ms M complained,  NatWest  agreed in 
April 2017 to refund all interest  and charges from August 2016 to April 2017.  And they 
refunded further  charges in November  2017. However, ongoing  interest and overdraft 
charges were added  to her account after that as Ms M was still in arrears.
Ms M says at one point  she was told the account  was defaulted and a repayment plan was 
agreed, but when she called to make  her first payment  NatWest  didnt have any record of 
this agreement. Ms M says NatWest knew that she was homeless  and in financial difficulty. 
And not being  able to sort out her account  caused  her distress and affected  her health.
Ms M is also unhappy that NatWest didnt record her address correctly on her account and 
that she didnt  receive  responses from NatWest to her complaints.
Our investigator thought NatWest should  have done more to help Ms M during a time of 
financial difficulty and she acknowledged  that there seems to have been  issues  with Ms Ms 
address records and how they handled  her complaints. She recommended NatWest  should 
refund all interest and charges until the account  went into credit. She also asked them to pay 
Ms M an additional £150 in compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused by their 
overall service.
Ms M disagreed. She said the compensation recommended was too low and didnt take into 
account the substantial impact  the ongoing  issues had on her over a long period of time 
when she was already in a very difficult situation.
As no agreement could be reached  Ms Ms case was passed  to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree that the complaint should  be upheld. And I think  the level of 
compensation that the investigator  recommended  is fair. I appreciate that this will be 
disappointing for Ms M. Ill explain my reasons below.
I know that Ms M has been unhappy  with NatWest  for a long time and she raised several 
complaint points in relation to the management  of her account and the service she received. 
I can assure Ms M that I considered all the information she provided and all the comments 
she made, even if I havent  specifically mentioned  them  in this decision. 
Ref: DRN11192662As far as I can see Ms Ms concerns relate broadly to two main issues:
NatWest applying charges and interest  to Ms Ms account  when she already had 
difficulties paying her arrears and not offering her a repayment plan
NatWest holding incorrect  contact  details for her and not responding to her 
complaints 
financial difficulty and repayment  plan
NatWest have acknowledged that they should  have  done more  to help Ms M and I agree. 
Having looked  at their records  I can see that Ms M contacted NatWest  several  times  asking 
for a repayment plan,  but nothing was put in place.  
Ms M says NatWest  knew that she was homeless and in financial difficulty and she has sent 
documents to this service to evidence her situation. I havent seen any written evidence that 
Ms M told NatWest she was homeless at any point.  However, its possible that she told them  
in branch or over the phone and I can see on contact notes that she did tell them she was in 
financial difficulty. So I would have expected  NatWest to offer more help in any case.
Ms M says she was told during one conversation that her account had been defaulted and a 
repayment plan had been put in place, but later NatWest couldnt find a record of this. I dont 
know what exactly was discussed during  this phone call as NatWest couldnt provide any call 
recordings. 
I can see contact notes  in November 2017  that show  Ms M offered to pay £3 per month but 
this was deemed too low and she was advised to speak to recoveries.  The call was then 
transferred to a recoveries advisor.  The notes suggest that on the same day it was agreed  
Ms M would pay £1 per month going forward which somewhat supports Ms Ms version  of 
events. 
I dont know whether a default was discussed,  but NatWest have confirmed the account  
wasnt defaulted at any point. In December 2017  I can see Ms M called NatWest several 
times on the same day but the call notes are unclear on what exactly  was discussed.
I know Ms M feels  NatWest should  be punished  for not being  able to provide call recordings,  
but it isnt this services  role to punish businesses.  And irrespective of what  was discussed 
during the calls in November  and December 2017,  I think NatWest should have treated her 
differently in any case.
Ms M was in arrears  on her account and hadnt made any payments since  August 2016. I 
would have expected NatWest to have reached  out to her earlier  and agree a repayment 
plan and -if this wasnt possible- to default the account between three to six months after Ms 
M stopped making any payments  towards  her debt.
So I think this should have happened by February 2017 at the latest. I would like to point out 
that a default or being in arrears doesnt mean charges and interest automatically have to be 
suspended. But Im glad to see that in April 2017, NatWest agreed to refund all interest, fees 
and charges on Ms Ms account  from August 2016-April 2017 as a goodwill gesture which  I 
think was fair.
However, Ms M continued not to make any payments to the account and theres a contact 
note in August  2017 that shows Ms M asked NatWest for a refund of further  charges as she 
Ref: DRN11192663was in financial difficulty. Ms M did mention  that she wanted to come to an agreement to 
clear the balance but that the charges  were  exacerbating her situation.  Ms M was promised 
a call back, but I cant see this happened  and I also havent seen any other  evidence  that 
NatWest tried to help Ms M with an arrangement.
I appreciate that another refund of interest and charges happened in November  2017  which  I 
think was the right thing  to do. But I think NatWest overall should have done more  to help 
Ms M. So I agree NatWest should do more to compensate her which I cover later.
incorrect contact details  and service issues
Ms M said she moved  addresses often in the last two years  but she says she ensured she 
did her best to update this information with NatWest. She says that she always  received new 
cards and PIN numbers  to the correct address and when  she went into branch, she was able 
to print bank statements with her correct  address  recorded on it. However,  she didnt receive  
responses to some  of the complaints she raised.
NatWest werent able to provide any conclusive information about  Ms Ms address updates, 
or why she would correctly receive some information, but not other information. So they 
admitted something  possibly went wrong  on their side. 
NatWest also agreed  that the overall  customer service Ms M experienced when raising  her 
complaints couldve  been better. It acknowledged  the difficulty  Ms M experienced in raising 
her complaints, as well as the delays caused in addressing some  of them.
NatWest paid Ms M £65 compensation  in December 2018 when Ms M complained  about  
customer service  issues  she experienced during a call in December 2017 as well as the fact 
NatWest didnt have  a record of setting up a repayment plan in November 2017 and her not 
receiving one of the final response letters to her complaint.
summary
When looking at how to put things right I need to look at the impact NatWests  actions have  
had on Ms M.
I have no doubt  that Ms M found herself in a difficult situation and that not being able to clear  
her debt and incurring further charges  over a period of time would have caused her anxiety  
and distress.  I also understand Ms M is homeless and suffers  from ill health. 
As explained above, I think  NatWest didnt offer as much help as they could have done. But I 
also have to take into consideration that Ms Ms outstanding balance on this account was 
around £700-£800  and so I dont think it would be fair to hold NatWest to account for Ms Ms 
overall situation. 
NatWest didnt have  to refund any charges and interest on Ms Ms account as they were  
applied in line with their terms and conditions. However, NatWest should  treat customers in 
financial difficulty positively and sympathetically  and from what I have seen Ms M did try to 
come to an arrangement  and wasnt supported  properly. 
I appreciate NatWest have already refunded some interest and charges  (from  August 2016-
November 2017). And they previously paid Ms M £65 for customer service  issues which did 
in part cover the aspects of her complaint here (not receiving a final response and a default 
Ref: DRN11192664not being recorded). This was paid directly into the account at the time.  Ive considered all of 
this when determining  what further compensation should be paid.
putting things right
I think its fair in this particular case that NatWest refunds all remaining interest, fees and 
charges on Ms Ms account (until the account reached a positive balance)  which  havent 
been refunded  already.
In addition I agree that NatWest should pay some additional compensation for the distress 
they caused Ms M by not helping her with a repayment plan earlier and for the customer  
service issues  that stemmed from her address not being  recorded correctly. I think an 
additional £150 in these  circumstances is fair.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained Im upholding  Ms Ms complaint and request National 
Westminster Bank Plc to pay Ms M the compensation  I set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 July 2019.
