K820x#14Complaint
Miss K complains  that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt follow  her instructions to change 
a direct debit and standing order collection date. 
Background
After changing  job Miss K says she took steps to amend  the collection date for bills she paid 
via direct debit and standing order so they would be collected on 31 May 2019.
Miss Ks council tax direct debit of £108 was collected on 29 May 2019 as well as a standing  
order for £368. NatWest  sent Miss K a message to ask her to pay funds into her account. 
Miss K contacted NatWest on 29 May 2019  and complained about the payments that had 
been taken. NatWest said it could arrange for a refund under the direct debit guarantee. The 
funds for Miss Ks council tax were  refunded  on 31 May 2019.  Miss K incurred £24 of 
charges because her account had gone into an unarranged overdraft but NatWest later 
issued a refund.  
An investigator at our service looked at Miss Ks complaint but didnt uphold  it. They  said 
NatWest couldnt  change the date a direct debit  is collected  and that the charges shed 
incurred had been refunded. Miss K asked to appeal so her complaint has been passed to 
me to make a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest says it cant change the date a direct debit is collected. NatWest says the party  that 
collects the direct debit is responsible for the date the payment is taken. I understand Miss K 
wanted to change the direct debit collection date because of her new job, but NatWest is 
correct when it says it cant amend the date a direct debit is collected.  A direct debit 
instruction allows  the collecting  party to debit  someones account  for varying amounts when 
payments become due. So NatWest had no influence on when Miss Ks council tax was 
collected. 
So whilst I understand why Miss K wanted  to change the date her council tax was taken, 
NatWest wasnt able to change that. I havent  found that NatWests  actions led to the direct  
debit being taken on 29 May 2019.  
Miss K says she wanted  to change the date a standing order was taken from her account  as 
well but that NatWest advised  the collection date cant  be amended. Instead, customers  
need to set up a new standing order instruction for the correct  date. As Miss K didnt arrange 
a new standing order, I think  NatWest  was right to continue with the existing instruction. I 
havent seen anything to show NatWest made a mistake. 
The council tax was refunded to Miss Ks account  on 31 May 2019 and NatWest later 
refunded the £24 unarranged overdraft she incurred.  That means there has been no 
financial loss as a result of the direct debit and standing order  being collected on 
29 May 2019. 
Ref: DRN28371492Im sorry  to disappoint Miss K but, for the reasons Ive given above, I havent found  anything 
to show NatWest made a mistake. As a result, I havent been persuaded to uphold this 
complaint. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 March 2020.
