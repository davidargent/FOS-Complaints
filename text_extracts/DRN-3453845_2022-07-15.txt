The complaint
Miss P complains PayrNet Limited (PayrNet) hasnt returned money to its sender when her 
Pockit account with them was closed.
What happened
A Pockit account is a pre-paid payment card administered by PayrNet.
Miss P had a Pockit account with PayrNet. Miss P received £500, which she says was from 
a family member. She says this wasnt the first time this family member had sent her money. 
In September 2021, Miss Ps account was restricted. She says that PayrNet flagged her 
account and asked for documents and information, which she refused to send.
Miss P asked for her account to be closed and she says that in the terms it states that if the 
information isnt provided, they would return the money to the source. Miss P asked PayrNet 
to return the money to the sender but believes they are refusing to do so.
PayrNet closed Miss Ps account in November 2021. Remaining funds in her account at the 
time were also removed from her account. Miss P contacted PayrNet to enquire where the 
funds had been sent to as she didnt believe they were sent back to her family member. Her 
requests or enquiries were either not actioned or not responded to.
Miss P referred her complaint to our service. She says that she planned to use the money to 
start a business but as she didnt have access to the money, she couldnt do so. Instead, 
she says she found a job which resulted in extra costs in travel and loss of time. She also 
says she had stress and anxiety because the funds still hadnt been returned to the sender.
Our investigator found that PayrNet needed to put things right by arranging for the £500 to 
be returned to the sender as soon as possible and by also compensating Miss P with £100 
for the inconvenience shes had. She says she reached these findings as she believes 
PayrNet should have acted sooner in closing Miss Ps account and in returning funds to the 
sender. She says PayrNet were not acting in line with their terms.
Miss P believes compensation of around £400 for the inconvenience she received is fairer, 
due to loss of earnings. She has provided screenshots of messages she has received from 
friends and family of the purchases they intended to make once her business was up and 
running.
PayrNet say the terms and conditions are there to protect the business and consumer and 
couldnt see that they are being adhered to. They say, among other things that they 
requested information from Miss P, but as she didnt provide them, they couldnt be 
reasonably expected to close Miss Ps account.
As Miss P disagreed with the investigators findings, the complaint has been passed to me to 
decide on.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding this complaint and Ill explain why below.
PayrNet terms state that to close an account, any outstanding balance must be returned to 
the account holder and PayrNet reserve the right to request proof of the recipient account or 
address. It goes on to say that PayrNet reserve the right to return funds back to their source 
in the event the account holder fails to provide satisfactory proof of the account in a timely 
manner and to which they are satisfied.
PayrNet has important legal and regulatory obligations it must meet when providing 
accounts to customers. And it must take certain actions in order to meet those obligations. 
They are also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of new and existing customer 
relationships. That sometimes means they need to restrict customer accounts  either in full 
or partially while they carry out a review.
Having looked at the information PayrNet relied on, including how Miss P was operating her 
account, Im satisfied they were complying with these obligations when they blocked Miss 
Ps account and asked her for information. The terms and conditions of Miss Ps account 
also permit PayrNet to block an account and Im satisfied PayrNet acted in line with them. 
So, I cant say PayrNet did anything wrong when it decided to review Miss Ps account.
However, while PayrNet are entitled to carry out a review, and request information, I dont 
think PayrNet has acted fairly since then. PayrNet initially blocked Miss Ps account in early 
September 2021. PayrNet asked Miss P to provide it with information at the time. The 
information requested was to confirm Miss Ps identity and also contained questions 
enquiring about the source of the money. Miss P says she refused to provide this 
information. Miss P then requested for her account to be closed and the money returned to 
the source  as the terms suggest would happen if the account holder fails to provide 
satisfactory proof of the account in a timely manner.
In November 2021, the Pockit account was closed. PayrNet has told our service that a few 
days before the account closure, the remaining funds held within it were transferred to the 
house ledger. From what I have seen, I dont think they have since been returned to the 
sender.
I dont think PayrNet have acted fairly here and in line with their own terms. I cant see any 
evidence to suggest why the money hasnt been returned to the sender and why it has been 
retained in the house ledger. 
PayrNet responded to the investigators view and provided comments. Among other things, 
they explained that Miss Ps account couldnt be closed as she didnt provide the information 
requested. But in other correspondence they have confirmed the account has been closed. 
So Im unsure of the relevancy of their comments here. They also said that as Miss P hasnt 
provided proof of the account, they dont need to return the money at this time. But Miss P 
hasnt requested the money to be sent to her, but rather returned back to the sender. I dont 
see how Miss P not providing information should prevent the money being returned to the 
sender, as the terms suggest this should happen. So, in any event, PayrNet hasnt clearly 
explained why they have held on to the funds.
Miss P contacted PayrNet to enquire about the funds when her account had closed. I cant 
see she received a response. Miss P also didnt receive a response on multiple other occasions she had contacted them. I appreciate how frustrating this experience must have 
been for Miss P. She says, she also had stress and anxiety because the funds hadnt been 
returned to the sender, which in this case, she says is a family member. So, I think it would 
be fair for PayrNet to pay Miss P £100 for distress and inconvenience.
Miss P has provided evidence which she believes shows loss of earnings. However, I dont 
think it is clear enough to evidence loss of earnings. In this instance, a third-party family 
member sent Miss P money, and has since not received it. I dont think there is a direct link 
between the family member not receiving the money back and Miss Ps loss of earnings. So, 
Im not persuaded that Miss P incurred a financial loss because of PayrNets actions.
Putting things right
Given the circumstances, I direct PayrNet Limited to pay Miss P £100 for the distress and 
inconvenience caused.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Miss Ps complaint and direct PayrNet Limited to put 
things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 August 2022.
