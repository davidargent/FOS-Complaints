The complaint
Mrs J complains that she was mis-sold a Tech Pack (TP) with her current account by 
Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) in 2016.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. For 
clarity this decision is only about the TP sale, as one of our ombudsmen has already decided 
that other aspects of Mrs Js original complaint were outside of this services jurisdiction.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusions reached by our adjudicator for these reasons.
Ive looked at the two letters sent to Mrs J when her previous Current Account Plus was 
migrated to a Current Account with TP in 2016. In my view the letters make clear what her 
options are, including in regard to a fee free overdraft. The letters are correctly addressed. 
Mrs J says that she was aware at the time she had the option for a free account. So, I think 
its more likely than not that she received at least one of them.
Barclays was not offering an interest free overdraft with a free account, so if she wanted to 
continue her fee free overdraft, she needed to pay for the TP, and as the letter to her was 
clear, I believe she chose to do so. So, I dont think Barclays did anything wrong when it 
migrated Mrs J to a Tech Pack in 2016.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold Mrs Js complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 April 2021.
