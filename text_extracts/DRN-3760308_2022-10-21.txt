The complaint
Mrs R complains Foundation for Credit Counselling trading as StepChange have:
Unreasonably and unlawfully delayed adding a debt to her existing 
Debt Management Plan (DMP).
The conduct of StepChanges staff throughout has been dismissive, patronising, and 
at times discriminatory.
StepChange sent a letter dated 1 February 2022 which contains legally incorrect and 
deliberately misleading statements.
StepChange have failed to provide evidence of their investigation and failed to 
provide an adequate response to the concerns raised.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision setting out whatd happened, and what I thought about that. 
Ive copied below the relevant elements, and they form part of this final decision.
Mrs R set up a DMP with StepChange. A DMP is a plan that allows Mrs R to make one 
monthly payment to StepChange, who will then send payments to her creditors on her 
behalf.
In January 2022 she asked StepChange to add another debt to the DMP, and when they 
asked to speak to her on the phone she complained. Following her complaint, Mrs R said 
she experienced a number of issues including staff being dismissive, patronising, and at 
times discriminatory.
Im aware Mrs R did say specific reasons why she felt discriminated against. Given this is a 
published decision out of respect for her privacy Ive not mentioned them directly  but I 
wanted her to know I have seen her concerns and taken them into account.
In their letter of 7 February 2022 StepChange said on 10 January 2022 Mrs R contacted 
them regarding accounts with companies Ill refer to as B and L. On 13 January 2022 they 
asked if the account with L was the same as an account they already had. Mrs R replied the 
same day and said it was a different account, and she had some questions, but wanted it 
added to the DMP straightaway. StepChange said on 18 January 2022 they asked Mrs R to 
call them. They said there were two reasons for this  Mrs R said she had some questions, 
and they needed to check if a DMP was still suitable. StepChange explained:
The addition of the account with L would significantly change Mrs Rs overall debt
The current estimated total debt was £4,405.98, and if adding Ls account, then itd be 
£6,944.64  an increase of 36.5%.
Mrs R currently pays £88 to her debts each month, adding the account from L will 
substantially reduce the amount she can pay to each debt
This will likely increase the time it takes for Mrs R to pay off her debt by another two years.
Although the DMP is likely to still be suitable, they still need to check this.
On this point, StepChange didnt think theyd done anything wrong. 
In a separate response on 23 February 2022 about StepChanges advisers, they partially 
upheld the complaint saying although they could have communicated with Mrs R better, the 
advisers werent incompetent.
Unhappy with this, Mrs R asked us to look into things.
Our Investigators did so, but ultimately didnt think StepChange needed to do anything 
further.
Mrs R didnt agree, in summary she said:
Wed failed to take into account that no material information can be given over the phone 
that StepChange dont already have.
Regardless of the increase of debt the DMP remains the correct plan, and StepChange cant 
legally or procedurally justify any other recommendation.
Mrs R said the letter of 23 February 2022 hadnt been sent to her. 
A Subject Access Request (SAR) wont give her copies of the documents shes asked for. 
We failed to address the incorrect dates in the letter of 1 February 2022.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs R has made a number of comments about the actions of StepChange not meeting legal 
standards. I think its important to explain my role is to take into account regulations, good 
industry practice and relevant law  but my overriding remit is to decide things on a fair and 
reasonable basis. I cant decide whether StepChange have or havent done something in 
accordance with the law itself  I can only decide whether I think theyve acted fairly or not.
StepChanges request for Mrs R to call them
Mrs R says there is no regulatory or legal reason for them to have asked her to do this  and 
doesnt think its acceptable to say its their process.
StepChange set out in their response the reasons why they wanted Mrs R to call  and they 
also explained this in email exchanges with Mrs R, saying shes right there is no legal 
obligation for her to have to call them but their process is for her to do so.
Ultimately, I cant tell StepChange to change their procedures, all I can do is to consider 
whether their processes have had an unfair impact on Mrs R.
One of our Investigators asked Mrs R if shes not able to use the phone  but she didnt 
reply to this. I can see during her complaint with StepChange she has asked them to call 
her. And, when contacting us, shes at times called us or asked for a call. With that in mind, 
Ive seen nothing to suggest Mrs R would be disadvantaged by having to call. So, it seems 
this is her preference, rather than she cant.
I can see StepChange have justified on several occasions to Mrs R why she needs to call. 
Theyve set out, and Ive summarised above, how much this additional debt she wanted to 
add would impact her plan. Theyve also explained its possible when discussing the matter 
that their recommendation of a DMP may no longer be suitable. But they can only know this 
when they talk to Mrs R.StepChange have quoted regulatory rules called the Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC) 
 and section eight of CONC deals with debt advice.  StepChange quoted CONC 8.2.2 to 
Mrs R saying:
One aspect of conducting a firms business with due skill, care and diligence under Principle 
2 is that a firm should ensure that it gives appropriate advice to customers residing in the 
different countries of the UK. Failure to pay proper regard to the differences in options for 
debt solutions available to those customers and to the differences in enforcement actions 
and procedures is likely to contravene Principle 2 and may contravene other Principles
In essence I think this places the emphasis on StepChange to ensure theyre always giving 
the correct advice. Here, Mrs R wants to increase the debt on her plan by over 36%, which 
could add over two years before matters are resolved. I think StepChange have been clear 
and consistent in saying the reason for wanting Mrs R to call, is to make sure theyre 
continuing to give good advice.
I appreciate Mrs R doesnt think she can provide anything on the phone that StepChange 
dont already know  but its for StepChange to decide the way they want to work, and Ive 
seen nothing to suggest Mrs R couldnt call.
Taking everything into account I dont think I can say StepChange have acted unfairly. 
Because of that, I dont think StepChange have delayed getting the debt added to Mrs Rs 
DMP plan  theyve given her the right information at the earliest opportunity.
The conduct of StepChanges staff
Mrs R feels theyve been dismissive, patronising, and at times discriminatory.
StepChange have said the phone call that took place on 1 February 2022 could have been 
handled better  and they felt some email communication also could have been handled 
better. For this, theyve said sorry.
Ive listened to the call that took place on 1 February 2022. In it the call starts with 
StepChanges agent asking if now is a good time to speak, Mrs R says no, and when 
StepChange say they can call back, she says theyve got her now and the call continues. 
The agent then confirms the reason for the complaint, and then starts to explain the reason 
why they said they needed to speak to her. Mrs R says there is no lawful reason for the call. 
The agent attempts to have a conversation with Mrs R, but she doesnt let them. In listening 
to this call, I think its fair to say the agent did their best to try and explain matters, but Mrs R 
wasnt prepared to listen to them. 
I can see StepChange have said the agent could have handled things better. But Im 
required to assess the complaint based on the information available to me. And having 
listened to the call I dont think the agent did anything wrong. 
Ive also considered the written communication. Having done so I dont think any of this was 
unclear or abrupt either as has been suggested. I think what Mrs R was asked to do, and the 
reasons for it, were explained as clearly as they could be. So, I dont think StepChange did 
anything wrong on this point either.
I appreciate StepChange has said they provided Mrs R with poor customer service at times. 
Mrs R doesnt see it that way. She believes what StepChange have done goes beyond poor 
customer service. Shes felt they discriminated against her. I dont though think I can fairly 
say Ive seen in the customer service StepChange have discriminated against Mrs R, as 
shes suggested, as I dont think theyve actually done anything wrong nor treated her differently to anyone else. I say this because Im satisfied they followed the same process 
with Mrs R that they do with all their clients. 
Letter dated 1 February 2022
I understand Mrs R thinks this letter contains deliberately misleading and incorrect 
information.
But, having looked at the letter, I dont agree with this. The copy of the letter Mrs R has sent 
us, appears to say StepChange want her to call them to add the debt on to the DMP  and to 
make sure the DMP remains the best debt solution for her.
Ive already set out above why I dont think this was unreasonable  so I dont think 
StepChange have said anything that is misleading or incorrect in this letter.
Mrs R has also said the information is illegal, but as Ive set out above, I cant make a finding 
on whether information is or isnt illegal, as that is a matter for a court of law to decide  but I 
can consider whether StepChange have acted fairly. 
StepChange havent provided evidence of their investigation
One of Mrs Rs complaint points is StepChange havent shared what information they 
considered when replying to her complaint. 
I can see one of our Investigators suggested Mrs R raise a SAR if she wanted to know what 
evidence StepChange had relied on when carrying out their investigation. In response to 
this, Mrs R has said StepChange arent required to share this information, according to the 
Information Commissioners Office.
StepChanges request for Mrs R to call them aside, the rest of this complaint relates to 
communication shes had or received. So, given Mrs R has said StepChange arent obliged 
to share the information with her  but most of it shes had anyway, I dont think theyve done 
anything wrong on this point.
Responses to my provisional decision
Mrs R didnt accept my outcome. In summary she said:
The decision isnt clear and shes not received a reply to the complaint raised in full 
due to StepChanges process of encrypting documents and not providing passwords 
to access those documents. 
At the top of the decision Ive asked StepChange to consider their processes around 
asking for a call knowing nothing has changed, but havent upheld this aspect. She 
asks why this part of her complaint hasnt been upheld.
Ive stated StepChange have said the reason for the call was explained by them to 
her, but she says Ive not set out in the decision what this was. Mrs R also asks what 
evidence Ive got to show theyve told her this information.
She asks which phone call I listened to, as the call she had was a member of staff 
refusing to escalate the complaint for her.
In relation to the suggestion about her not making the call, she says she made it 
clear the reason the call cant take place is because its during working hours. The 
wait times are in excess of 30 minutes which she cant do during a weekday.Ive failed to address StepChange not calling her between 1pm and 2pm and asks 
why Ive not addressed this and if it changes the outcome.
In respect of the letter, she asks how Ive reached the conclusion its just asking her 
to call, when the letter starts youll remember we recently wrote to you about a debt 
that isnt on your debt management plan. She says this statement is not only 
factually incorrect but also misleading because StepChange hadnt proactively 
written to her about her debt. She also says the letter was delivered well beyond the 
1 February 2022 its actually dated to coincide with the complaint made to 
StepChange about their inaction.
Off the back of Mrs R replying I arranged for us to ask StepChange some further questions. 
Ive incorporated their responses into my thoughts below.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill address Mrs Rs points in order  but I should explain having reconsidered everything I 
still dont uphold this complaint.
My decision isnt clear and shes not received a response in full to the complaint
Im sorry Mrs R doesnt think my decision is clear. As shes not explained what specifically 
she thinks isnt clear, I cant clarify those points  instead Ive focused on answering the 
concerns she raised in response.
In terms of the complaint she raised with StepChange shes said she never received a copy 
of the letter because of the online process to access this. 
When putting this to StepChange they said theyd posted out the letters to Mrs R due to her 
difficulties accessing the letters online. Theyre not able to prove this but said they didnt 
think there was any reason to doubt shed received the letters.
Our general approach to this is if letters have been posted by a financial business theyve 
fulfilled their requirements and we wouldnt say theyve done anything wrong. Here, I cant 
know if they did post the complaint letters, because they cant provide evidence of this.
Where information is incomplete I have to decide what I think is more likely than not, based 
on the information I do have. Ive seen emails Mrs R has sent StepChange explaining shes 
not able to access the letters  and in response StepChange say theyll post them.
On balance, I think its more likely than not they did. Why Mrs R didnt receive them I cant 
say, but on balance Im satisfied StepChange have done what theyre required to do on this 
point.
But, even if I thought StepChange then hadnt posted the letters, Id need to consider the 
impact. Mrs Rs concerns on this point are shes not seen the full outcome of her complaint. 
This isnt what she said initially  in her email to our service on 28 February 2022 she said 
shed not been provided with any evidence of the investigation. Regardless though, Ive seen 
emails exchanged between Mrs R and StepChange on 10 and 14 February 2022 which do 
set out StepChanges position on Mrs Rs complaint. So, Im satisfied Mrs R has been given 
the reasons for them turning down her complaint.Mrs R says Ive asked StepChange to consider their processes so why hasnt the complaint 
been upheld
Ive noted Mrs Rs comments, but I havent asked StepChange to change their processes. 
Ive said I cant tell them to change their processes, all I can do is consider the impact of 
their processes on Mrs R. And, for the reasons Ive set out in this decision, I dont think 
StepChange have done anything wrong. 
Ive not set out in the decision the reasons StepChange wanted Mrs R to call her
Ive re-read my provisional decision, and Im satisfied the section StepChanges request for 
Mrs R to call them does explain why StepChange wanted her to call and my thoughts on 
this. And Ive included in the What happened section of the provisional decision from 
StepChanges email of 18 January 2022 where they set out this information:
The addition of the account with L would significantly change Mrs Rs overall debt
The current estimated total debt was £4,405.98, and if adding Ls account, then itd 
be £6,944.64  an increase of 36.5%.
Mrs R currently pays £88 to her debts each month, adding the account from L will 
substantially reduce the amount she can pay to each debt
This will likely increase the time it takes for Mrs R to pay off her debt by another two 
years.
Although the DMP is likely to still be suitable, they still need to check this.
Which phone call have I listened to
The phone call I listened to was 1 February 2022  which is the same call StepChange have 
said they apologised for. I also asked StepChange to provide us with all calls  so I could 
listen to those.
Ive listened to all the calls provided. Of these there was only two more, one of which was a 
call where Mrs R and StepChange agreed a call back at a specific time  and the second 
was the call back which went to voicemail.
Ive not been provided with a call where Mrs R was told she couldnt escalate matters. As I 
can only base my outcome on the evidence available to me  which is primarily the call of 
1 February 2022 which I mentioned in my provisional decision, I still dont think StepChange 
have acted unfairly here.
Reason for not calling them is due to having to call during worktime
Again we put this to StepChange, and they said this wasnt part of Mrs Rs original complaint 
to them.
Ive also not heard this mentioned explicitly on phone calls that shes not able to make or 
take calls during her working day. She does say theyve called her while shes working, but I 
think that is the case for most people giving StepChange work to general office hours of 8am 
to 6pm. So, overall, I still think StepChanges request for her to call them was still 
reasonable.
StepChange not calling between 1pm and 2pm
I hadnt addressed this issue as it wasnt something thatd been raised as a complaint point  
but as Mrs R has now mentioned it I arranged for us to put this to StepChange.In response they said theyd never agreed to call her between 1pm-2pm. The calls Ive been 
provided with say StepChanges agent would call her back at 3.10pm  and Ive been 
provided with a voicemail saying the agent called back when agreed. So, I cant say theyve 
done anything wrong on this point.
1 February 2022 letter  factually incorrect and StepChange delayed sending it
Mrs R has concerns about this letter saying theyd written to her about the debt. Ive seen 
emails from StepChange to Mrs R on 18 January 2022 about the debt. Although this wasnt 
a letter, I think in the ordinary course of things its fair to say StepChange sending an email 
could reasonably be interpreted as having written to Mrs R. So, I dont agree with her that 
the letter is factually incorrect, because they had written to her about her debt  albeit it was 
by email rather than a letter.
And for the delay in this letter being sent we also asked StepChange for evidence of it being 
posted. On this occasion, StepChange were able to provide this. The screenshot shows the 
letter was sent 1 February 2022 So, Im satisfied the letter was posted when StepChange 
said it was  1 February 2022.
Why it arrived a week later I dont know, but even if StepChange had delayed sending the 
letter (which, as Ive set out above, Ive seen evidence they havent), Id need to again 
consider the impact on Mrs R. Shes said the letter was deliberately delayed so StepChange 
could send it when they also sent the complaint response. Im not sure how this scenario 
could have a significant enough impact on Mrs R for me to then say StepChange need to do 
anything further.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2022.
