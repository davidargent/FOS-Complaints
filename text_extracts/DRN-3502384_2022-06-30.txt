The complaint
Miss P, through her representative, complains that Short Term Finance Limited (STFL) lent 
to her irresponsibly. 
What happened
Information from STFL and Miss P led our adjudicator to create a loan table of 33 loans from 
August 2012 to March 2021 and as the last three loans have outstanding balances then they 
remain open. 
That loan table was used when our adjudicator sent his view and since then many of the 
loans appear to have been resolved. And so, I have not reproduced the whole table  just 
those for which there remains a dispute.

One of our adjudicators did not have enough information to conclude on some of the earlier 
loans but he did think that STFL should put things right for loans 6 to 9 and loans 15 to 33.
STFL responded to say that it agreed to the uphold for loans 6 to 9 and loans 15 to 19, but it 
gave specific reasons for not agreeing to the others from loan 20 onwards and those are set 
out in the main body of this decision and I address them there. 
Miss P agreed to that view by our adjudicator but did not agree to what STFL had said. So, 
the disputed loans appear to be loans 20 to 33. The partially unresolved complaint was 
passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about high cost short-term and home 
credit lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our 
website. 
STFL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mis P could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. 
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that STFL should 
fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the 
consumer. 
These factors include:
having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting 
the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was 
becoming, unsustainable);
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
STFL was required to establish whether Miss P could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being the 
ability to repay without undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
to do that.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ps complaint.
Our adjudicator had proceeded on the basis that loan 10 was the first loan of a new lending 
chain and I agree with that assumption from looking at the details of the loans.
Our adjudicator said that for loans 6 to 9 in that lending chain, and from loan 15 to loan 33  
the pattern of lending showed some of the key indicators to lead him to think this was 
repetitive lending. Those were the frequency of the lending, the length of time Miss P had 
been in debt to STFL, the fluctuation in amounts lent and sometimes the fact they 
overlapped. Our adjudicator considered that these all pointed towards Miss P being reliant 
on the credit. So, our adjudicator thought this was likely harmful to her and was keeping her 
out of the mainstream credit available to most consumers.
STFL agreed with this for some of the loans, but it said that the gap in lending between loans 
19 and loan 20 meant this showed Miss P was not reliant on the credit from STFL. I have 
looked at the closure date of loan 19 provided to us by STFL and that was 6 July 2018 and 
loan 20 was approved for Miss P on 16 June 2018. There is no gap there as they loans 
overlapped. And reviewing the details I have for the loans after loan 15 there are no gaps in 
the lending. So, I do not agree with what STFL has said. 
Another point STFL has raised after our adjudicators view is that on issuing loan 20 it knew 
of her County Court Judgment (CCJ) and so asked for a 30 day bank statement to consider 
and carry out an enhanced due diligence check. STFL has not sent to us a copy of that 
bank statement or its findings from reviewing that and so I dont attach much weight to what 
STFL has said about it carrying out an enhanced due diligence exercise as I do not know 
what that revealed.
I have also looked at the overall pattern of STFLs lending history with Miss P, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which it should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so STFL ought to have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Miss Ps case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6 in the 
first lending chain and by loan 15 after that in the same way that our adjudicator did. I say 
this because:
from Loan 15 onwards Miss P was provided with a new loan within days of settling a 
previous one and often they overlapped. Sometimes Miss P was approved for two 
loans in a day. So STFL ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss P 
was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances and that Miss Ps indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed. Miss Ps last loan 
was approved for her in March 2021 which was five years after the first in this lending 
chain 
In fact, the last approval date was 23 March 2021, and STFL gave her two loans with 
a combined value of £300 and she already owed it money on loan 31. Loan 10 had 
been for £50. Miss P had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to STFL over 
an extended period.
I think that Miss P lost out because STFL continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 to 9 
and loan 15 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ps indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the sheer number of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Miss Ps ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about the loans the adjudicator upheld and for clarity I am 
including them all into the redress section here  loans 6 to 9 and loans 15 to 33. STFL 
should put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STFL should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Miss P for loans 6 to 9 and for loans 15 to 33, as 
Im satisfied it ought to have. Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, 
answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Miss P may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this lender which they may not have had with others. If this wasnt a 
viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming 
that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real 
and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Miss P in a 
compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Miss P would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. 
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFLs liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right.
STFL shouldnt have given Miss P loans 6 to 9 and loans 15 to 33. My understanding is that 
there are some outstanding balances on some of the loans. 
If STFL has sold the outstanding debts STFL should buy these back if it is able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If STFL is not able to buy the debts back then STFL should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) STFL should add together the total of the repayments made by Miss P towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything 
it has already refunded.B) STFL should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss P 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss P originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) STFL should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Miss P as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Miss P having made 
overpayments then STFL should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. STFL should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B 
and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus 
then the surplus should be paid to Miss P. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then STFL should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss P. 
E) The overall pattern of Miss Ps borrowing for loans 6 to 9 and loans 15 to 33 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from 
Miss Ps credit file. STFL does not have to remove loans 31 to 33 from Miss Ps credit file 
until they have been repaid, but STFL should still remove any adverse information recorded 
about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires STFL to deduct tax from this interest. STFL should give 
Miss P a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Ps complaint in part and I direct that Short Term 
Finance Limited does as I have outlined above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 July 2022.
