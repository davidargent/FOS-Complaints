The complaint
Mr L has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) acted irresponsibly by 
providing him with an overdraft he couldnt afford. 
What happened
Mr L held an account with NatWest and applied and was approved for an overdraft with a 
limit of £1,250 in February 2020. This limit was reduced to £1,200 in March 2021. 
Mr L complained to NatWest that it acted irresponsibly by approving an overdraft facility for 
him. NatWest didnt uphold the complaint. And as Mr L was dis-satisfied he referred the 
complaint to our service.
One of our adjudicators looked into Mr Ls complaint and thought that the initial overdraft 
lending was reasonable based on the information NatWest had and that there wasnt 
anything in the credit check carried out which should have led NatWest to question what Mr 
L had said his income and expenditure and thought that NatWests checks went far enough. 
Mr L disagreed, he says NatWest shouldnt have lent to him as no income was going into the 
account which was part of NatWests lending criteria and has asked for an ombudsmans 
decision. 
Mr L has a number of credit products held with NatWest which he has raised complaints 
about. The decision below only covers Mr Ls overdraft facility with NatWest  all other 
complaints are being dealt with separately.
I issued my provisional decision on 31 August 2023. In my provisional decision, I explained 
why I was proposing to uphold Mr Ls complaint. I invited both parties to let me have any 
further submissions before I reached a final decision and neither NatWest or Mr L have 
added any new information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision I said that:
NatWest needed to make sure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
is it needed to carry out proportionate checks to be able to understand whether Mr L would 
be able to repay what he was being lent before providing any credit to him. Our website sets 
out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks were 
proportionate. 
And in this case Im not persuaded NatWest checks went far enough. I say this as NatWest 
has itself said it has been unable to supply the specific affordability assessment details for 
Mr Ls overdraft application, so I cant say on what basis it approved Mr Ls overdraft. 
But I have seen some data from the credit file supplied which shows that at the time Mr L 
applied for his overdraft with NatWest he already had a total revolving credit limit of £9,185 
and unsecured lending of £2,354 and that Mr L had declared monthly income of £1,800 but 
this couldnt be checked from Mr Ls statements as his salary wasnt being paid into his 
NatWest account. Based on this information Im not persuaded further lending of £1,250 was 
affordable for Mr L and that NatWests checks went far enough.
Indeed, Mr Ls statements show within two months of being provided with his overdraft he hit 
the top of his limit and didnt see or maintain a credit balance again. 
If NatWest had carried out the appropriate checks and properly considered the amount of 
unsecured debt Mr L had and the amount of credit already available to him, I think it is likely 
that NatWest wouldve realised Mr Ls income wasnt enough to service the borrowing he 
already had and that he would have difficulty repaying further lending. 
So I currently dont think NatWests checks went far enough when it approved Mr L for an 
overdraft and I think NatWest acted unfairly when it charged overdraft interest and 
associated fees from February 2020. NatWest ought to have realised that it was unlikely Mr 
L would have been able to sustainably repay the overdraft within a reasonable period of time 
given the amount of debt and credit he already had available to him. 
So I currently think that NatWest didnt treat Mr L fairly and he lost out because of what 
NatWest did wrong. 
As neither party has provided any further evidence or arguments for consideration, I see no 
reason to depart from the conclusions set out in my provisional decision. It follows that I 
uphold this complaint. 
Putting things right
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Mr Ls complaint for NatWest to put things right by:
Reworking Mr Ls current overdraft balance so that all interest, fees and charges 
applied to it from February 2020 are removed.
AND
If an outstanding balance remains on the overdraft once these adjustments have 
been made NatWest should contact Mr L to arrange a suitable repayment plan 
for this. If it considers it appropriate to record negative information on Mr Ls 
credit file, it should backdate this to February 2020. 
OR
If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer 
being an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments 
and returned to Mr L along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from 
the date they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement. If no 
outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, then 
NatWest should remove any adverse information from Mr Ls credit file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NatWest to take off tax from this interest. NatWest must 
give Mr L a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if they ask for one.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained I uphold Mr Ls complaint and direct National Westminster 
Bank Plc to pay the fair compensation as outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 October 2023.
