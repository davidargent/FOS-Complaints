The complaint
Mr N complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Oodle Financial Services Limited, trading as Oodle Car Finance, wasnt of satisfactory 
quality.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr N under a hire purchase agreement with Oodle Car 
Finance that he electronically signed in February 2019;
Oodle Car Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory quality 
will depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the car and the 
price that was paid for it;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car that was supplied to Mr N was about six years old, had been driven for 
105,401 miles and had a price of Â£8,079;
Mr N complained to Oodle Car Finance in August 2020 that the car had been 
supplied to him with an outstanding safety recall and that there was an issue with the 
instrument panel;
it investigated his concerns and found that a campaign had been issued by the 
manufacturer in February 2018 for a heater element, but it wasnt a safety recall, and 
said that it would arrange for the required work to be completed at a manufacturers 
dealer  it said that although the car was driveable it would arrange for the car to be 
collected, and would contribute towards the cost of a hire car;
it also said that the dealer had repaired the instrument panel but as Mr N wasnt 
satisfied with its response, it arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent 
expert in September 2020;
the inspection report recorded the cars mileage as 127,198, and said:
In conclusion, there was no plausible evidence presented at the time of the 
inspection to suggest that the vehicle was not fit for its intended purpose of 
daily use on the public highway, with the current symptoms, in our opinion, 
being the direct result of an electrical issue which can occur suddenly and 
without warning.
Taking into account the time that has elapsed in conjunction with the vehicles 
overall physical condition, we are led to the conclusion that the vehicle was in 
a general condition consistent with the vehicles age and reported mileage at 
the point of sale in February 2019. We believe the current issue has 
developed after the point of purchase with the most likely cause being an 
electrical issues which can appear suddenly and without warning.
Mr N complained to this service but our investigator was unable to conclude that the 
car was of unsatisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr N and that he couldnt 
reasonably say that Oodle Car Finance had done anything wrong in this situation;
its clear that Mr N feels very strongly that theres a fault with the cars instrument 
panel and that the car was supplied to him with an outstanding safety recall  hes 
stopped using the car and says that he wants to return it to the dealer for a refund;
I sympathise with Mr N for the issues that hes had with the car and the difficulties 
that hes described, but Im not persuaded that the outstanding recall about the 
heater was enough to cause the car not to have been of satisfactory quality when it 
was supplied to Mr N and I consider that Oodle Car Finance has acted fairly and 
reasonable in its response to that issue by the actions that it took relating to the 
recall;
there are some issues with the instrument panel but the independent expert has 
concluded that the issues developed after the car was supplied to Mr N and that the 
car was fit for use;
Mr N didnt complain to Oodle Car Finance about the issues with the instrument 
panel until August 2019, more than 18 months after the car was supplied to him and, 
at the time of the inspection in September 2019, hed been able to drive more than 
21,000 miles in the car;
the cars MOT test history shows that it passed MOT tests in January 2019, January 
2020 (with some advisories  but not relating to the instrument panel) and January 
2021 - which shows that the car continues to be in a roadworthy condition;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr N and I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Oodle Car Finance to allow 
Mr N to reject the car, to pay for any further repairs to the car, to pay more 
compensation to Mr N or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
If Mr N is suffering financial difficulties, he should contact Oodle Car Finance about those 
difficulties. Its required to respond to any such difficulties positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ns complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2021.
