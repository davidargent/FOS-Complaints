K820x#14complaint
Mr N complains about the length of time took PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to add money  
into his account.  Mr N is also unhappy that he didnt  receive a final response to his 
complaint. 
background
On 13 May 2018 Mr N made a payment into his PayPal account from his bank account.  He 
wanted to add funds to his PayPal account  so he could make a purchase.
He said the PayPal activity log said the money  would appear  in his PayPal account on 18 
May 2018. But Mr N said when he checked his PayPal balance on 18 May 2018 the 
payment was still showing as pending. 
Mr N said the money  he paid to his PayPal account left his bank account  on 21 May 2018. 
But it still hadnt arrived in Mr Ns PayPal  account  by the time he complained to PayPal on 
the morning of 23 May 2018. He said PayPal  responded  to his complaint  the same  day 
explaining that the money was now available for Mr N to use. It also explained that the delay 
in Mr Ns funds reaching him had been  because PayPal had to clear the funds from his bank 
to the clearing house before reaching  PayPal.  
Mr N wasnt satisfied with this explanation and stated that the money hadnt credited his 
PayPal account  until the eighth  working  day after he had tried to add the funds in question. 
So he complained to our service about how long PayPal had taken to process the payment 
he had made to his account on 13 May 2018.
Our adjudicator empathised with Mr N but didnt uphold his complaint. They  told Mr N that 
they thought PayPal had dealt with his complaint fairly. So they didnt think  it needed to do 
anything more here. Mr N disagreed and asked for his complaint to be referred to an 
ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I think  PayPal acted 
fairly and reasonably in how it dealt with Mr N. I know this wont be the decision Mr N is 
hoping for. So, Ill explain why I wont be upholding this complaint.
Ive seen evidence  that PayPal successfully  requested the funds  that Mr N wanted to add to 
his PayPal account from his nominated bank account. It did so promptly on the day he 
instructed it to add funds  to his account. So, Im satisfied that there was no delay in PayPal 
requesting the funds  from Mr Ns nominated bank account.
Those funds took eight  working days to credit  Mr Ns PayPal account. The user agreement 
between PayPal and Mr N sets out the process  in which funds are added  to a customers  
account. Having  seen that user agreement, Im satisfied that PayPal acted in line with the 
terms and conditions of that agreement when  it processed Mr Ns payment. I say this 
because section 3.3 of PayPals User Agreement applies to the transaction  that Mr N made 
here. This clause says as follows:
Ref: DRN31762152You agree  that when  PayPal receives a payment  from your bank  account  to obtain E-
money in your Account, PayPal may hold the funds in your Reserve  Account  for so long as 
PayPal determines  that an NSF Risk exists. In such an event, the E-money  will not be made 
available to you in your Payment Account (including for the execution  of any Payment Order  
that the bank payment was made to cover)  until PayPal determines that the NSF Risk has 
passed. Until that time the bank payment will appear to you as Uncleared in your Account 
details. PayPal is not in possession of all the information necessary to place the funds from 
your bank payment  at your disposal until it determines that the NSF Risk has passed.
So, PayPals terms and conditions say clearly that once it receives a payment from a 
customers bank account it can hold those funds in a customers reserve account for so long 
as it determines  that an NSF Risk exists. PayPal says an NSF  Risk means the risk that a 
bank may reverse a bank  funded payment due to the reason that there were insufficient  
funds in the bank account to make the payment. 
PayPal told us that when Mr N opened his account  with it, on 24 September 2008,  he 
wouldve had to accept  the terms of the User Agreement  conditions in order to use its 
service. I appreciate that Mr N opened his account  a significant time ago but the terms of 
PayPals User Agreement are accessible via a link that can be found on every  page of 
PayPals website. So, I think it would  be clear to Mr N what  terms and conditions applied  to 
this transaction.
PayPal told our service that when  a customer adds funds from their bank account, as Mr N 
did here, they are directed  to a page,  which says:  
Well email  you when the money you sent from your bank  account  has been  received in 
your PayPal account. Please allow 1-2 business  days. 
This is a generic  message.  And PayPal said it also would provide a customer with the 
following additional information regarding the time it can take to process a payment: 
After you initiate a transfer,  it usually takes  1-2 business days  for your bank to process your 
transfer request  and for the funds to arrive in your PayPal  account. Please note that 
processing times may vary depending  on your bank. 
So, I think the information PayPal gave Mr N here made it clear that the time it would take to 
process his payment would depend on his bank. I dont think PayPal gave a guarantee to Mr 
N about the length of time it would  take for his payment to reach his account.  And I think  it 
was also clear to Mr N that hed received an email when the money had been received in his 
PayPal account.
Here, the funds Mr N wanted to add to his PayPal  account were released  to PayPal by Mr 
Ns bank on 21 May 2018. So, while Mr N said he saw a message explaining that the funds 
would credit his PayPal account on 18 May 2018 they werent received by PayPal until after 
this date. PayPal  couldnt add funds  to Mr Ns account until it received them. So, this 
explains why they couldnt be added to Mr Ns account on 18 May 2018. It follows  that I dont 
think PayPal did anything  wrong in not crediting Mr Ns account with the money in question  
on 18 May 2018.
PayPal said the delay in it receiving the funds in question was caused by Mr Ns bank. As 
PayPal is a money processor it cant determine  or control when  funds from a bank will be 
Ref: DRN31762153released to it. And I cant fairly and reasonably hold it responsible for something thats 
beyond its control.
When Mr N complained to PayPal it told him that it had to clear his funds from his bank to 
the clearing house  and that it takes approximately five to seven working days  before  the 
funds reaches its system.  Mr Ns money  credited his PayPal account on the eighth  working  
day after he made his payment  request.  But PayPal  also said that once Mr Ns money  was 
received it processed  the payment in line with its User Agreement.  And it said it added  those 
funds to once  the NSF  Risk had passed.  It said it completed all checks  in accordance with 
the terms of the PayPal  User Agreement in a timely  manner. Im persuaded PayPal credited 
the balance of Mr Ns account with the funds in question as soon  as it was able to. I havent  
seen any evidence to suggest that PayPal didnt follow  the correct  procedure here. And Im 
satisfied it acted in line with its User Agreement when  it processed Mr Ns payment.  
I appreciate that the delay in Mr Ns money  crediting  his PayPal account meant that he was 
unable to purchase the item this money was intended for. And I realise it mustve been 
inconvenient for Mr N to have to ask a family member to order the item in question on his 
behalf instead. But, for me to uphold  a complaint I must be able to say a business  has done 
something wrong. As I cant say PayPal has is this instance, Im unable to ask it to do 
anything more for the reasons set out above.
The final part of Mr Ns complaint is that PayPal didnt send him a final response after he 
raised his complaint with it. Ive thought about the impact this had on Mr N.
The correspondence PayPal  sent Mr N following his complaint it summarised  his complaint, 
explained what had happened and gave him its final answer. This is what  wed expect a final 
response letter to do. But it didnt tell him he could refer his complaint to us.
Although Mr N didnt receive a final response letter he knew  how to escalate  his complaint to 
our service.  And I can see that he was able to refer his complaint to us promptly and without 
delay. He complained to us on 20 July 2018,  well within the time limit he had to raise  this 
matter with us. I havent seen anything to persuade me that the absence  of a final response 
letter caused  Mr N prejudice.  It follows that I dont think  it would be reasonable for me to tell 
PayPal to compensate  Mr N for not providing  him with a final response to his complaint.
 
my final decision
My final decision is I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 May 2019.
