Ms D settled card 1 in March 2019. She failed to meet her contractual repayments on cards 
2 and 3 and NewDay sold those debts to a debt collections agency in March/April 2021. 
Card 4 was never used.  
Ms D says the lending was never affordable and this would have been clear to NewDay had 
completed adequate checks.
Our investigator said Ms Ds complaint should be upheld in part. He found all lending from 
August 2019 onwards was irresponsible, explaining NewDays checks most likely showed 
Ms D indebtedness had significantly increased since she applied for card 1; she was 
struggling to make her repayments for card 1 and was frequently overlimit on card 1.
NewDay disagreed, saying it acted fairly  it carried out sufficient checks and saw no 
indicators of financial difficulty. 
As an agreement wasnt reached the complaint was passed to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending -
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
NewDay is required to lend responsibly. It needed to conduct checks to make sure that the
credit facilities it was giving to Ms D were affordable and sustainable. Such checks need to 
be proportionate to things like the credit limits it offered Ms D, how much she had to repay
(including interest and charges) each month, her borrowing history with it and what it knew
about her. But there is no set list of checks it had to do. 
This means to reach my decision I need to consider if NewDay carried out proportionate 
checks at the time of each card application and limit increase; if so, did it make fair lending 
decisions based on the results of its checks; and if not, what better checks would most likely 
have shown. 
Card 1
When Ms D applied for the first card I can see NewDay asked about Ms Ds employment, 
income and used third party data to make assumptions about her living costs. It completed 
an external credit search to check her credit history. And it has provided the data it collected 
at the time.
Ive looked at the data and I can see Ms D told NewDay that she was employed on an 
annual income of £21,500. The credit file data shows that Ms D had other credit 
commitments, but the search results didnt reveal any information to indicate that Ms D had 
any defaults, adverse public records, or any accounts in arrears with other creditors.
I would flag here that NewDays final response letter is inaccurate in that it states Ms D had 
unsecured debt of £1,391 and a mortgage of £21,200. The raw data it supplied shows that 
Ms D had unsecured debt of £21,200 and no mortgage. Her partners income was £1,391. 
That said, given this was Ms Ds first application to NewDay, for a relatively low limit, and as 
her credit check did not return any adverse information, I dont think there was anything that I 
think should have prompted NewDay to think Ms D was in financial difficulty or that further 
checks were needed to verify what Ms D had told it. It follows that I dont think NewDay was 
wrong to give card 1 to Ms D. 
Card 2
NewDay no longer has the results of its application checks for card 2. So I cant comment on 
what those checks showed NewDay. But irrespective, I dont think it made a fair lending 
decision based on information it had that I have had sight of - Ms Ds account history for card 
1. Whilst Ms D repaid the balance in full in March 2019, there were signs that she was 
having problems managing her money through the life of the account. 
She missed the first the first two payments and the account was in arrears for the 
subsequent 15 months, incurring late fees. She exceeded the credit limit in May 2018 and 
the account remained overlimit, incurring fees, for eight of the subsequent nine months until 
the balance was settled. I can also see (from the September 2019 account data, and I think 
its fair to rely on that as a proxy for August 2019 when Ms D applied) that Ms Ds overall 
debt level remained high at £22,726. So given this, and the fact Ms D had recently 
demonstrated financial strain to NewDay, I think it was wrong to approve her application for 
card 2.
As this is my finding for card 2 it follows I find the credit limit increase in March 2020 was 
irresponsible. NewDay could see from the monthly external data it received from the credit 
reference agencies that Ms Ds external borrowing was rapidly increasing, and she was in 
arrears on other accounts.
Cards 3 and 4
NewDay completed the same checks as for the card 1 and has provided the results. But it 
also had the monthly data for card 2 to use to inform its decision. So it could see that Ms Ds 
external borrowing had increased to £29,561 and that she had recently needed to take out a 
payday loan. She had also been in arrears for four months on card 2. And all this was in the context of an increased salary of £33,000. So, in the round, I think NewDay again ought to 
have realised there was a risk Ms D would not be able to sustainably repay her credit card. 
Indeed, Ms D went on to fall into long-term arrears on both cards 2 and 3 resulting in 
NewDay selling the outstanding balances to debt collecting agencies.   
I would make the same observations about the lending for card 4. NewDay was aware 
Ms Ds overall indebtedness was continuing to increase  now at £34,495. She had also 
started to use card 3 to withdraw cash  often an indicator of financial strain  and was in 
arrears on cards 2 and 3. It follows I find NewDay was wrong to give cards 3 and 4.
Putting things right
For cards 2, 3 and 4 NewDay should:
Refund all interest, fees and charges
Once the above refunds have been made, NewDay should contact Ms D to
discuss affordable repayment options.
Or, if the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer
being an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments
and returned to Ms D along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from
the date they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement.
Amend Ms Ds credit file to remove all adverse information recorded relating to loans 
2, 3 and 4.
.
As the debt from cards 2 and 3 has been sold to a third party, NewDay should take steps to 
either buy it back or work with the new owner to achieve the same outcome as the steps set 
out above.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to take off tax from this interest. NewDay must give     
Ms D a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one. 
My final decision
I am upholding Ms Ds complaint in part. NewDay Ltd must put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 July 2022.
