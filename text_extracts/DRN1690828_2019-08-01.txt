K820x#14complaint
Miss E complains  that Uncle Buck Finance  LLP gave her loans that she couldnt afford to 
repay. She asks that it refunds interest  and charges and removes information about the 
loans from her credit file.
background
Miss E took out seven  loans  with Uncle Buck between August 2014 and October 2017. She 
says the loans werent affordable and led to her having debt and gambling  problems. 
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that the complaint  should  be upheld.  She said Uncle  Buck 
had offered to refund  interest and charges on the fourth and fifth loans before the complaint 
came to us. So she wouldnt look into those loans. 
Our adjudicator said the information  Uncle Buck received  suggested loans 1 and 2 were 
affordable. While it should have made more checks before loan 3, it was unlikely 
proportionate checks would have shown the loan wasnt affordable.  As there was a break  of 
over two years between Miss E repaying  loan 5 and taking out loan 6, it was reasonable for 
Uncle Buck  to think she wasnt reliant  on the loans. 
Miss E said she now wants to accept Uncle Bucks  offer. But since it issued its final 
response her unpaid loan balance  has increased. And she says Uncle  Buck (and the debt 
collection company  now managing the debt) wont accept a part settlement. She asks that I 
require Uncle Buck to treat her fairly  by accepting  a settlement of half the debt owed.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss E 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
Miss Es income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.

*Uncle Buck has offered  to refund  interest and charges, with 8% interest,  on these loans. 
loans 1 to 3
When she took out loans 1 to 3, Miss E told Uncle Buck her monthly income was £1,400 and 
her outgoings were between £250 and £650.  I dont think  Uncle  Buck had any reason to 
think loans 1 and 2 werent affordable.  
Given the amount  of the repayment,  and that this was Miss Es third loan in just over a 
month, I think  Uncle Buck might have done more thorough checks  before agreeing loan 3. 
But I dont think,  given the amount of the loan and Miss Es stated income,  proportionate 
checks would have  given  it any reason  to think the loan wasnt  affordable  or that further 
checks were needed.  I dont think at this point Uncle Buck needed  to ask for evidence   
such as bank statements   that would have  revealed problems, such  as gambling or 
significant use of short term loans. 
loans 4 and 5
Uncle Buck  offered to refund interest  and charges on loans 4 and 5, with 8% interest. I 
understand Miss E intends now to accept this offer. So I wont consider these loans here. 
loans 6 and 7
Miss E took out loan 6 in August 2017,  more than two years after shed repaid loan 5. I think 
this was sufficient  time for Uncle Buck to reasonably believe any problems shed had  such  
a reliance on short term loans  had been  resolved.  Miss E told Uncle Buck  her monthly  
income was £1,450. The information she provided  about her outgoings suggested  the loan 
repayments were affordable. I dont think Uncle Buck had any reason to think  loans 6 and 7 
werent affordable.
Ref: DRN16908283what should happen now?
In its final response letter,  Uncle Buck offered  to refund all interest and charges Miss E paid 
on loans 4 and 5, with interest of 8% simple  a year. It explained that it will have to take off 
tax from this interest and that Miss E can ask for a certificate showing how much tax its 
taken off. I think this is fair. 
Miss E says shes recently  contacted Uncle Buck  about the refund. She says Uncle Buck  
has told her it intends to apply the refund to reduce the debt she owes. While this is a 
change from the offer made by Uncle Buck in its final response letter,  Miss E says she 
doesnt have a problem with this. However, Id remind Uncle  Buck that it must treat Miss E 
fairly. I think  its helpful if I explain what I mean by this.
Uncle Buck  sold the debt to a third party. Miss H is concerned about the third party  taking 
legal action to recover the debt. I think it would  be fair if Uncle Buck  either buys the debt 
back before  applying the redress  or pays the refund  directly to Miss H. If Uncle Buck  does 
apply the refund to the outstanding debt, it should do so after deducting  any tax.
Miss E says, since  Uncle  Buck issued its final response, the balance she owes (which 
relates to loan 7) has increased. This is because she missed a payment while  the complaint 
was with this service. Its likely an outstanding  balance will remain after the refund is applied  
to it. Miss E says she can no longer  negotiate a settlement with Uncle  Buck which, she says, 
would have been possible a year ago. 
Im sorry  that its taken as long as it has for Miss Es complaint to be investigated.  But Miss E 
owes the debt and needed to make the agreed  repayments, regardless of whether she 
decided to bring her complaint to this service. Its for Uncle Buck  (or the third party that now 
owns the debt) to decide whether to accept Miss Es offer to settle the debt with a payment 
of part of the amount owed.
If Miss E is in financial  difficulties Id expect Uncle Buck to respond fairly  for instance by 
agreeing a repayment plan. I dont think,  in the circumstances, its reasonable for me to 
require Uncle Buck to settle the debt for less than the amount owed.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint as I find that the redress  offered by Uncle 
Buck Finance LLP is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.  Uncle Buck  should  pay that 
compensation in full and directly to Miss E unless  it repurchases  the debt relating to the final 
loan from the third party it was sold to in 2018.  Should it repurchase the debt I think  it 
reasonable for Uncle Buck  to use the redress it has offered to reduce that debt.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 September 2019.
