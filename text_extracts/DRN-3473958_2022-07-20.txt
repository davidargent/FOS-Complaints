The complaint
Mr L complains that Atlanta Insurance Intermediaries Limited misled him over his personal 
accident insurance cover. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator, for these reasons:
Mr L initially took out the policy in 2012 through Atlanta. Since then, the insurer has 
changed.
In January 2019, Mr L was hospitalised following an accident. He made a claim to the 
current insurer. 
Mr L is unhappy that Atlanta sent him a copy of the policy terms and policy schedule 
in 2021 which named the original insurer from 2012, rather than the current insurer. 
Atlanta apologised to Mr L for any confusion caused by its error, which I think was 
reasonable. 
I understand that Atlanta also sent Mr L a copy of the policy terms in 2020, after the 
insurer asked it to. Whilst these were the correct policy terms at the time they were 
sent, they werent the policy terms that applied as of the date of Mr Ls accident. 
Whilst I can appreciate that this caused Mr L confusion, Atlanta wasnt aware that 
Mr L had made a claim. So I dont think it was at fault for this confusion.
Im not upholding Mr Ls complaint, as Im satisfied that Atlantas apology was reasonable in 
the circumstances for its error. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 August 2022.
