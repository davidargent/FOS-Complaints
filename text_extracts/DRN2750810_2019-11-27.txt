Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ws complaint and thought the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me. As 
neither party  has disagreed with the findings of the first 4 loans I will only be looking at loan 5 
to 18.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN27508102the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his/her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
In this instance by loan 5, Mr W concurrently had 2 loans outstanding with Sunny. Loan 5 
was the fourth advance  in less than 5 weeks. And Loan 3, 4 and 5 were advanced with 7 
days. Having borrowed £250 with Loan  3 hed increased his capital indebtedness  to £450. 
This meant that his monthly  repayment had increased from around £70 per month  to £137.
I think that at this point  Sunny should have reasonably been aware of the possibility that 
Mr W might  have been having problems managing his money. In circumstances such as 
these, I think that Sunny  should have realised  that it was unlikely that Mr W wouldve been 
able to sustainably  repay this and any further borrowing.
I note Sunnys comments that its overlapping loans represented a credit  line in which Mr W 
was allowed to borrow up to a certain  amount concurrently. But Mr W taking out 5 loans 
within as short a period as six weeks should really have raised concerns with Sunny  as to 
why he needed  to borrow so often. I think Mr Ws need to borrow again so quickly  suggests 
he was struggling.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN27508103Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr W had taken out 6 loans within 2 months.  So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Mr W was having  to borrow  further to cover  the 
hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ws 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ws first loan was for £150 and loan 6 was for £250.  At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that Mr W was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in their 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr W was provided with a new loan within weeks of settling  a 
previous one. 
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 18 was 
taken out 11 months after Mr Ws first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr W had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans which Mr W borrowed was likely to have  had negative  
implications on Mr Ws ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loan 5 to 18 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things  right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loan 5 to 18 taken out between  
April 2016 and February 2017;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Mr Ws credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from 6 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  6 to 18 should be removed from Mr Ws credit  
file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
Ref: DRN27508104For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited trading as (Sunny) should  pay Mr W compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 December  2019.
