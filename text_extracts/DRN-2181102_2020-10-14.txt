DRN-2181102
The complaint
Ms M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly said she was 
vulnerable and should not have concluded she was.
What happened
Ms M says she called NatWest to make a payment but during the call NatWest assumed she 
was a vulnerable customer and tried to transfer her to a vulnerable customer team. She says 
she was offered £200 compensation but that isnt enough and should be awarded £1,000 
compensation. Ms M says NatWests actions have caused her anxiety and distress and 
made her unwell.
NatWest says it has apologised to Ms M and offered her £200 compensation which she 
accepted. It says it tried to help Ms M and it wasnt its intention to upset her or cause her 
distress. NatWest said during the call between it and Ms M she told it she had a career and 
was disabled, and it didnt intend its actions to be derogatory.
Ms M brought her complaint to us and our investigator thought overall NatWest had made a 
fair and reasonable compensation offer. The investigator thought NatWest tried to help Ms M 
but accepted she was upset by NatWests actions.
Ms M accepted the investigators view but later decided she didnt accept it and says she 
would like £1,000 compensation. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the overall view that NatWest has dealt fairly with this 
complaint by apologising and by making a fair and reasonable compensation offer.
I have listened to both telephone calls between Ms M and NatWest. Im satisfied that Ms M 
told NatWest that she was disabled, had a career and that she had previously been the 
victim of theft to the value of £3,000. So, I dont think NatWest acted unfairly or made a 
mistake by offering Ms M the use of its vulnerable customer team and by providing that 
telephone number. I also think that NatWest was trying to help Ms M, but I accept that the 
use of the term vulnerable customer upset Ms M as she didnt think it was appropriate or 
accurate. I accept that NatWest could have handled the call with more tact and 
understanding. But I make clear that I think it was trying to help Ms M and told her the 
telephone number it gave her would cut down on waiting times.
Im satisfied that NatWest has apologised for what took place and has made what I think is a 
fair and reasonable compensation offer of £200. I dont think Ms M suffered any financial 
loss and I dont think NatWests actions had a significant impact on her. For those reasons I 
cant fairly order NatWest increase that compensation award. I also think that NatWest fairly 
explained its position when Ms M called it back.
I have looked at NatWests records and those records suggest it has already paid the £200 
compensation. 
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc has made a fair and reasonable 
compensation offer of £200. Ms Ms acceptance of that offer, if it has not been paid, would 
be in full and final settlement of this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 November 2020.
