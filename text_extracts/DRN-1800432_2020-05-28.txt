The complaint
Mr W is unhappy with the price hed received from Kindertons Ltd for his van, after itd been 
written off in a road traffic accident. 
What happened
Mr Ws van was involved in a non-fault road traffic accident in November 2019. Kindertons 
were instructed to manage the claim and an independent engineer said the van was a write 
off. The engineer initially said the van was worth £2,721 plus VAT. But the valuation was 
increased to £2,920 plus VAT (£3,504) based on the average of three of the trade guides 
usually used for valuing vehicles. Based on this, Mr W was paid £3,504.
Mr W has complained that his van has been undervalued. He feels a fair valuation would be 
£3,880 plus VAT (£4,656) based on the Parkers trade guide value. So hed like Kindertons 
to pay him the difference between £4,656 and £3,504  an additional £1,152.
Our investigator explained that we dont tell businesses how to value vehicles, but wed 
expect them do this fairly. And we can carry out our own valuations to see if the valuation the 
business used was fair and reasonable.
The independent engineer had said Mr Ws van was in an average condition, and the 
investigator said the market average for vans in a good/clean condition was £2,913 plus VAT 
(£3,495). So he thought Kindertons valuation was fair, and he didnt ask them to increase 
their valuation.
Mr W didnt agree with the investigator. He believes that the valuations of his van done at the 
time of the accident give a value much higher than £3,504, and hes explained in some detail 
why he feels this is the case. So hes asked for an ombudsman to review his case and make 
a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I have reached the same 
overall conclusions as the investigator, and for broadly the same reasons. Ive focused my 
comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented on any specific point, its 
because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right outcome.
When considering this complaint, Ive looked at the comments made by the independent 
engineer. They said the condition of Mr Ws van was average with some pre-accident 
damage. So Ive considered the valuations done at the time of the accident and taken the 
values that reflect the pre-accident condition of the van.
There are four standard industry price guides that are usually used for valuing vehicles:Carzana valued the van at £3,358, based on November 2019 values and it being in 
good condition (there isnt an average condition value).
CAP valued the van at £1,755, based on November 2019 values and it being in 
average condition.
Glasss valued the van at £2,841, based on November 2019 values (there arent any 
condition options).
Parkers valued a van similar van to Mr Ws at £3,880, based on January 2020 
values.
The valuations from Carzana, CAP and Glasss are all based on the values at the time of the 
accident and were obtained using Mr Ws registration number. But this isnt the same for 
Parkers, which gives a value for vans of the same year with some adjustment for mileage. 
And its based on a January 2020 value. So I dont think its reasonable to consider the 
Parkers valuation  this hasnt been done on the same basis as the other valuations, so 
cant be considered a like-for-like comparison.
I also wont be considering the valuation done by CAP for Mr Ws van in a clean condition. 
The van was in an average condition and CAP have a valuation option for this. So its only 
fair to consider the valuation that most closely reflects the pre-accident condition of the van.
The average value of Mr Ws van, based on the three valuations listed above, is £2,651 plus 
VAT (£3,181). If I were to exclude the CAP valuation  the lowest of the three valuations, the 
average value increases to £3,099 plus VAT (£3,718). But it wouldnt be fair to exclude the 
CAP valuation, as its the only one that truly reflects the pre-accident condition of the van.
So Im satisfied that £3,181 is a fair valuation. And Mr W was paid £3,504. Based on this, I 
cant agree that the valuation Mr W received was unfair.
I appreciate that Mr W hasnt been able to find a replacement van, of a similar age and 
mileage to his van, for the amount hes been paid. And this is unfortunate. But that doesnt 
mean the valuation he received mustve been wrong.
Mr Ws van was first registered in 2009 and had done almost 138,000 miles at the time of 
the accident. Hes provided details of three similar vans that were for sale in early 2020:
Van 1  2011, 123,500 miles, £3,900 (advert states NO VAT to be added to price)
Van 2  2010, 129,000 miles, £3,995 (on sale through a popular online auction site, 
so the price includes VAT)
Van 3  2010, 177,000 miles, €4,000  approximately £3,500 (VAT status unknown 
as the van was for sale in the EU, not the UK)
These are advertised prices and arent necessarily the prices thatd be realised on sale. But 
the trade guides are based on actual sale prices. So these for sale adverts arent enough 
for me to say that the independent engineer shouldve discounted the trade guides when 
valuing Mr Ws van. So I wont be asking Kindertons to adjust their valuation.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint about Kindertons Ltd. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 June 2020.
