The complaint
Mr F complains NewDay Ltd (NewDay) refused his online credit card application to transfer 
his existing credit card account from another provider and gave poor customer service.
What happened
Mr F says he held a partnership credit card with a major retailer, and it changed its card 
provider to NewDay. Mr F says this should have been a straightforward process, but after 
several attempts his online application was declined. Mr F says he then spent unreasonable 
lengths of time on the telephone trying to speak to NewDay and was passed to various 
different NewDay agents. Mr F says he was also worried his credit score had been an issue, 
although he felt he had a perfect credit score. 
Mr F wants NewDay to apologise for the issues he has faced and to pay him compensation 
for the time and trouble he has been put to. 
NewDay says Mr Fs online application was processed by its underwriters but the 
application was declined, as at that time it failed to meet its lending criteria and provided Mr 
F with various reasons why that might be. NewDay says it has apologised for the upset the 
declined application caused, but it hasnt made any errors here. NewDay says Mr F 
subsequently reapplied for a retailer partnership credit card the following month and this was 
approved.
Mr F wasnt happy with NewDays response and referred the matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator says it wasnt for him to decide whether or not NewDay should have agreed to 
the credit card application, only to consider if Mr F was treated fairly during the application 
process. 
The investigator felt NewDay had considered Mr Fs online application but at that time it 
didnt meet its lending criteria and it is not obliged to disclose its lending policy as this is 
business sensitive. The investigator acknowledged Mr F had submitted a new application a 
month later and this was successful. The investigator didnt feel NewDay had done anything 
wrong.
Mr F didnt agree with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I wont be upholding this complaint and I will explain how I have come to my 
decision. 
I can understand it would have been upsetting for Mr F to have his online application for the 
transfer of his existing retailer partnership credit card declined by NewDay. When looking at 
this complaint I will consider if NewDay acted reasonably when it declined Mr Fs credit card 
application and if it treated him fairly during that process.
Mr Fs complaint centres around the fact he was attempting to transfer his existing retailer 
partnership card from one provider to the new provider NewDay, and he cant understand or 
accept why this should have been so difficult to arrange and additionally that this matter 
proved very difficult to discuss with NewDay.
I understand the points Mr F makes here and while he may not agree, the fact the retailer 
changed its provider would mean any transfer of that facility would involve a new 
underwriting process by the new lender, here NewDay. NewDay have explained at the time 
of Mr Fs online application in September 2022, it failed to meet its lending criteria and 
explained this to Mr F providing him with various scenarios why that might be. 
As indicated by the investigator its not the role of this service to tell NewDay it must divulge 
the reasons why the application didnt meet its lending criteria at that time, as this is 
considered business sensitive information. I am satisfied here NewDay did carry out a full 
credit review of the application but unfortunately for the reasons it explained in its final 
response letter to Mr F, it didnt meet its lending criteria at that time, although a subsequent 
application the following month was approved. 
With that in mind although Mr F may have experienced some inconvenience trying to speak 
to NewDay, it has apologised for that and on balance I dont feel that in itself would warrant 
compensation here.On a final note, Mr F has questioned why his credit file showed his 
previous retailer partnership credit card provider, but this isnt something I can consider here 
as thats not the responsibility of NewDay. 
While Mr F will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking anymore of NewDay. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 September 2023.
