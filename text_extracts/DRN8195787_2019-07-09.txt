K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains that NewDay Ltd recorded a default  on his credit  file when he entered into a 
payment plan.
background
Mr R opened a credit card account  with NewDay in October 2014. In August 2017  he 
contacted NewDay  and told it he was experiencing financial  hardship.  Following this, 
NewDay sent Mr R an income and expenditure form to complete and placed  a hold on the 
account.
The hold on the account expired at the end of September 2017. NewDay hadnt received a 
completed income and expenditure form. It contacted  Mr R to let him know  there were 
arrears on his account. It also sent him another income and expenditure form.
In January 2018 NewDay received Mr Rs completed income and expenditure form. Based 
on the information provided in the form NewDay set up a zero pound payment plan.
Mr R is unhappy that a default has been  registered on his credit file. He says he wasnt 
aware that hed been put on a zero pound payment plan or that his account would be 
defaulted. To resolve his complaint he wants NewDay  to remove the default.
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint and said the information provided by Mr R 
showed that he had no income  and that NewDay  hadnt done anything  wrong  in setting up a 
zero pound payment  plan.  The investigator  was satisfied that NewDay  had made Mr R 
aware that the payment  plan would show on his credit file and that a default might  be 
recorded.
Mr R didnt agree so Ive been asked to make  a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr R has said he wasnt aware he was on a payment plan nor was he aware of the 
consequences of being on the plan.
Ive looked at the system notes relating to the telephone call dated  5 January 2018, during 
which the payment  plan was discussed with Mr R. These show that Mr R was told that under 
his payment plan his account would continue to accrue arrears.  These  also show  that that a 
hardship plan script  was read out to Mr R explaining that the monthly payment on a zero 
pound payment plan was lower than the minimum payment required under the agreement.
Ive looked at the script which was read out to Mr R and I can see that there is a part which 
says that the payment plan will show on his credit file and that his account might be 
defaulted.
I think its likely that NewDay discussed the payment plan and its implications with Mr R and 
read out the hardship script to him. Because of this, Im satisfied that Mr R was aware  that 
Ref: DRN81957872he had been put on a payment plan and that he was aware  that his account might be 
defaulted.
I can see that Mr R made payments to the account  after he was put on the zero pound  
payment plan. I dont  doubt that Mr R paid what he could  but these payments werent 
enough to meet the minimum payment on the account which (but for the zero pound  
payment plan)  were  required.  Because of this, arrears continued to accrue on the account.
Mr R says he didnt realise that his account  would be defaulted. Ive already said Im 
satisfied that Mr R was given information about this during the call dated  5 January 2018. In 
addition, I can see that NewDay  sent a notice  of default to Mr R on 30 October 2017. This 
notice should  have served as a warning to Mr R that there were arrears on the account and 
that his account  might  be defaulted. NewDay sent a further letter to Mr R on 16 March 2018  
telling him it was going to proceed  with the default  notice.  I appreciate  that Mr R may not 
have received these  letters because he had moved. However, its up to Mr R to keep 
NewDay updated with any change of address.
Mr R says he wasnt told his account would be defaulted if he didnt repay  the arrears  in 180 
days. I cant see that NewDay provided this information. That said, I dont think Mr R would 
have been in a position to pay the arrears  in any event, because he had no income. 
NewDay are allowed to register a default  once a customer is at least  3 months behind  with 
payments. And it would be expected  to register a default where a customer is 6 months 
behind. I can see that Mr Rs account was more than 6 months in arrears when the default 
was registered.  Because  of this, Im unable to say that NewDay has done anything wrong in 
registering a default.
I appreciate this has been a difficult time for Mr R. However, having  taken  all of the available  
information into account, Im satisfied  that NewDay hasnt done anything  wrong  or treated  Mr 
R unfairly here. So I wont be asking NewDay to remove  the default.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 August 2019.
