Complaint
Mrs M complained about a number of loans she took out through a company called Elevate 
Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mrs M says she was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused her financial problems.
To keep things simple Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
Background
We now know that Mrs M took out 12 instalment loans from Sunny between September 
2018 and July 2019. Ive enclosed a summary of Mrs Ms borrowing with Sunny, based on 
the information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint and said they thought it should be upheld 
from the point of loan number 5 onwards. Sunny didnt agree it had done anything wrong. 
Ive been asked to make an ombudsmans final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice, on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking about Mrs Ms 
complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mrs M 
could repay all the loans she was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. However, certain factors might point to the fact that 
Sunny should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish whether Mrs M could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mrs M could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mrs M including assessing her income, expenditure and creditworthiness. It says that at the 
time all this information showed that she would be able to make the loan repayments she 
was committing to. Ive thought about this and also looked at the overall pattern of lending 
history with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have 
seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, 
at some point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans 
to Mrs M. 
Ive taken account of what Ive said above, about the length of the lending relationship, and 
applied it to the circumstances of loans 1  4 in this case. And I dont think its clear enough 
that what Sunny would have would have seen, from its checks, suggested loans 1  4 were 
either unaffordable for Mrs M or that the information from the checks it carried out 
undermined the income or outgoings Mrs M had herself declared. So Im afraid I dont agree 
that Sunny knew its lending was unsustainable for loans 1 - 4. I therefore dont uphold this 
part of the complaint.
I think from the point of loan number 5, the situation was different. However, theres no clear 
record that the type or depth of financial checks carried out by Sunny were more thorough 
and I dont think it looked thoroughly enough into Mrs Ms overall circumstances from this 
point on. 
For example, she was on a relatively low income and when taking out loan number 5, Mrs M 
still hadnt paid back the previous loan. So that was still outstanding at the same time and 
her combined monthly payments shot up by quite a bit. This meant the total amount Mrs M 
was supposed to pay back each month rose to what I consider to be an excessive amount 
when compared with her disposable income. In short, I think this made loan 5 unsustainable 
in the context of what Ive said above about affordability. Sunny therefore was wrong to lend 
to her from the point of loan 5.
In addition to the above, from the point of loan 6 onwards, there was an additional and clear 
pattern of repeated lending evident in my view. And there was an obvious dependency on 
high-interest, short-term lending evidenced by this, Mrs Ms sixth loan in around 6 months. 
So Im also upholding Mrs Ms complaint in respect of loans 6 -12 as Sunny repeatedly lent 
to Mrs M in an unsustainable manner because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ms indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time 
period; and
the length of time over which Mrs M borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost loans.
 Putting things right
In order to put things right for Mrs M, Sunny should:
refund all interest and charges Mrs M paid on loans 5 -12;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loans 9 - 12 and treat any 
payments Mrs M made towards these loans as payments towards the capital;
if reworking Mrs Ms loans 9 - 12 account(s) as Ive directed results in Mrs M 
effectively having made payments above the original capital borrowed, then Sunny 
should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of 
settlement. 
If reworking Mrs Ms loans 9 - 12 account(s) leaves an amount of capital still to be 
paid, then Sunny can use the total refund for any other outstanding loans to offset 
this. And if there is still an outstanding capital balance then I would remind Sunny 
that it should take a sympathetic view when seeking to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with Mrs M for the remaining capital;
remove any adverse information recorded on Mrs Ms credit file in relation to loan 5.
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 - 12 should be completely 
removed from Mrs Ms credit file.
If any of the debts were sold then Sunny must attempt buy back the debt or 
otherwise ensure the above is strictly complied with.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mrs 
M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
I partially uphold Mrs Ms complaint and direct Elevate Credit International Limited to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 July 2020.
