The complaint
Mr H complains that Oplo PL Limited wont refund to him the money that he paid to a holiday 
company for some membership credits. His wife is also involved in his complaint and hes 
being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
I understand that Mr H and his wife entered into a membership application agreement to buy 
some membership credits in November 2018. The purchase price of the credits was £12,246 
and they also exchanged an existing holiday product. Mr H entered into a fixed sum loan 
agreement with a finance provider for a loan of £12,246 and he agreed to make 179 monthly 
repayments of £125.01 and a final payment of £124.35 to the finance provider.
Mr Hs representative made claims, on Mr Hs behalf, to the finance provider in May 2020 
under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that: the credits were 
mis-sold and misrepresented to Mr H and his wife; the contract between them and the 
holiday company was breached; commission was paid between the finance provider and the 
holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr H which created a breach of fiduciary duty 
and an unfair relationship; the loan agreement was unaffordable; and the holiday company 
had filed for liquidation and was unable to fulfil the contract.
The finance provider said that the liquidators were trying to appoint a new manager for the 
credits and that all timeshare commitments would be honoured. It didnt provide a 
substantive response to Mr Hs section 75 claim but said that there was no commission 
arrangement between it and the holiday company and that it rejected and denied any 
allegations concerning an unfair relationship and breach of fiduciary duty. It also said that 
Mr Hs loan application would have been subject to an affordability assessment, based on 
the information provided by him in his application form. 
Mr H wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. His complaint form 
says that: the holiday company and the finance provider failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of his ability to afford the loan; the finance provider paid a commission to the 
holiday company which wasnt declared to him and the holiday company unduly pressured 
him and his wife into entering into the purchase agreement and him into entering into the 
loan agreement; all rendering the loan agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A. The 
finance provider transferred Mr Hs loan account to Oplo in August 2022.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Hs complaint should be upheld as he didnt think 
that the finance providers decision to turn down Mr Hs claims was unfair or unreasonable. 
He wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and he didnt 
think that Mr Hs claim about a breach of contract should be upheld. He said that he hadnt 
seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr H and the finance provider was 
unfair and he wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship 
was unfair. He didnt think that the lending was unaffordable at the time that the loan was 
made to Mr H, although he said that he appreciated that Mr H and his wifes financial 
circumstances appeared to have changed more recently.
Mr Hs representative, on behalf of Mr H, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. Mr H says that he and his wife were told that it was exactly the same 
product as they had before, they wouldnt sign away nine months of summer holidays for 
three months of winter holidays and they were never given a copy of the contract to look 
through and hence the opportunity to cancel the contract. 
Mr Hs representative says that Mr H has explained that he and his wife understood their 
previous timeshare purchases to be investments that they would be able to sell in the future 
and that they were told that buying the credits was an investment with an opportunity to rent 
points and to re-sell them in the future but timeshares tend to be overvalued and theres no 
functioning resale market. It says that the holiday company breached the Timeshare, Holiday 
Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010, the terms of the contract are 
unfair and oppressive to Mr H and his wife, the holiday company had a significant advantage 
and the clauses contained within the contract are significantly in favour of it.
Mr Hs representative has also raised its serious concerns about the way that the loan was 
sold to Mr H and it says that the holiday company didnt broker proper credit, the provision of 
finance was unfair and failed to reach the standard expected of a regulated firm, and Mr H 
has suffered harm as a result of the actions of both the holiday company and the finance 
provider. It has also provided a generic submission from counsel about various consumer 
complainants and providers of consumer credit for purchase of [credits from the holiday 
company]. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Hs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
I understand that Mr H and his wife bought some credits from the holiday company in 
November 2018 but Ive not been provided with a copy of the membership 
application agreement that they would have signed at that time  I have been 
provided with a copy of an annex to that agreement, the terms and conditions and 
the pre-contact credit information that have been signed by Mr H and his wife and 
Ive also been provided with a copy of the loan agreement that was signed by Mr H  
but I consider it to be likely that they would also have signed other documents in 
November 2018;
Mr Hs representative made claims to the finance provider in its May 2020 letter and 
Mr H then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter refers to claims under 
sections 75 and 140A, including that the credits were misrepresented to Mr H and his 
wife, but his complaint form only refers to claims under section 140A and doesnt 
refer to misrepresentations made by the holiday company;section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Hs claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not the finance 
providers response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
the May 2020 letter says that Mr H and his wife were advised that the product was of 
some substance but its worthless and has no merit and that it was represented to 
them that the purchase would be an investment as the product would increase in 
value and they would be able to sell it at a considerable profit, which is untrue;
neither Mr H nor his representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to Mr H and his 
wife;
I understand that the credits can be exchanged for a variety of vacations and 
experiences so I consider that the credits have some value and arent worthless;
Mr H says that he and his wife were told that the credits were exactly the same 
product as theyd had before but, given the nature of the credits and the way that 
they operated, I consider it to be unlikely that the holiday company would have said 
that the credits were exactly the same product as they had before;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr H and his wife were told that there was a 
functioning resale market for the credits, Mr H has confirmed that he and his wife 
havent tried to sell their credits and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that the holiday company represented to Mr H and his wife that the credits 
were an investment;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the credits were 
misrepresented to Mr H and his wife by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the membership application agreement by any such 
misrepresentations;
the May 2020 letter also says that the holiday company has ceased to trade and has 
committed a repudiatory breach of contract and evidence has been provided to show 
that the holiday company went into liquidation;
I consider that the liquidation of the holiday company would be a breach of contract 
for which Oplo would be liable under section 75, but I understand that a new 
management company has been appointed to provide the services in connection with 
the credits that Mr H and his wife had bought from the holiday company and Ive 
seen no evidence to show that their use of the credits has been adversely impacted 
by the liquidation of the holiday company;
I consider the appointment of the new management company to have been a suitable 
remedy for any breach of contract and Im not persuaded that Mr H and his wife 
would be entitled to terminate the membership application agreement in these 
circumstances;
Mr Hs representative says that commission was paid between the finance provider 
and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr H which created a breach of 
fiduciary duty and an unfair relationship - but the finance provider says that there was 
no commission arrangement between it and the holiday company;Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that the finance provider paid a 
commission to the holiday company and Im not persuaded that theres been a 
breach of any fiduciary duty in these circumstances;
Mr Hs representative says that the loan agreement was unaffordable for Mr H and 
Mr Hs complaint form says that the holiday company and the finance provider failed 
to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan - but the finance 
provider says that Mr Hs loan application would have been subject to an affordability 
assessment, based on the information provided by him in his application form;
it has provided information from Mr Hs application which shows that he had monthly 
pension income of £1,418 and that his wife was in full time employment with an 
annual income of £10,800  it shows that they had monthly outgoings of £1,366.10 
and other credit commitments of £91 each month;
Mr H says that no questions were asked about his and his wifes income and 
expenditure but he also says that his wife was working at that time with a monthly 
income of around £1,000;
I consider that the information that the finance provider has provided shows that it did 
conduct an assessment of the affordability of the loan for Mr H and I consider that it 
was reasonable for it to conclude at that time, based on the information that it had 
obtained from Mr H, that he could afford a loan with a monthly repayment of about 
£125;
Mr H says that he and his wife werent given a copy of the contract so didnt have the 
opportunity to cancel the contract  but they signed the pre-contract credit 
information and Mr H put his initials in a box to confirm that hed:  seen and read 
the pre-contract and explanation documents ; and the pre-contract credit 
information said: You have the right to withdraw from this agreement under section 
66A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, without giving a reason, by writing to [the 
finance provider];
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr H contacted the finance provider to withdraw 
from the loan agreement within the withdrawal period and the finance providers 
account records show that it contacted him about arrears on his account in 
November 2019 and he said that he disputed the account but didnt give any further 
information (and the arrears were then cleared);
Mr H was given a three month payment holiday in May 2020 as a result of the 
government imposed restrictions in response to the pandemic and he contacted the 
finance provider in September 2020, after the payment holiday had ended, and the 
accounts records show that he said that he couldnt afford the payment: due to being 
impacted by covid 19;
Mr H provided an income and expenditure form in September 2020 which showed 
that his wifes income had reduced due to illness and that their credit commitments 
had increased  but the changes to their financial situation have occurred since the 
loan was made to Mr H and, at the time that the loan was made to him, I consider 
that it was reasonable for the finance provider to conclude that the loan was 
affordable for him;
if he hasnt already done so, I suggest that Mr H explains his current financial 
situation to Oplo and its required to respond to any financial difficulties that hes 
experiencing positively and sympathetically;
Mr Hs complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured Mr H and his 
wife into entering into the membership application agreement and Mr H into entering 
into the loan agreement  but if Mr H and his wife felt that theyd been unduly pressured into buying the credits and didnt want to be bound by the agreement, I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have raised their concerns 
with the holiday company or the finance provider soon after theyd entered into the 
agreement;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr H complained about being unduly pressured 
until his representatives May 2020 letter to the finance provider  about 18 months 
later  and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr H and his 
wife were unduly pressured into entering into the membership application agreement, 
that Mr H was unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the 
holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mr Hs representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about 
various consumer complainants and providers of consumer credit for purchase of 
[credits from the holiday company] and Ive considered that submission which is 
made generally and doesnt make any specific reference to Mr H or the 
circumstances that led to the claims that he's made to the finance provider;
Mr Hs representative says that the terms of the contract are unfair and oppressive 
but I havent been provided a copy of the membership application agreement that 
Mr H and his wife would have signed in November 2018 or copies of all of the other 
documents that I consider it to be likely that they would also have signed at that time;
it would be for a court to determine whether any of the terms of those documents 
were unfair but I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) 
term alone is likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair 
relationship between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the 
term operated in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the 
relationship to be unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr H and his wife and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr H and his wife and 
the finance provider;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
has breached the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts 
Regulations 2010, that the loan was mis-sold to Mr H, that the holiday company 
didnt broker proper credit or that it or the finance provider failed to reach the 
standard expected of a regulated firm;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Hs relationship with 
the finance provider was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr H and the finance provider 
in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr H for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership credits, the financial difficulties that theyre experiencing and the health 
problems that his wife is suffering, but I consider that the finance providers response 
to his claims was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Oplo to refund to Mr H any of the money that he's paid for the credits, to cancel his 
loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 August 2023.
