The complaint
Mrs W complains about security checks applied by National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) to a series of payments she had set up on her account.
What happened
In July 2021, Mrs W used NatWests online banking facility to set up a series of payments 
from her account. The payments were to be sent to two separate recipients. Due to the daily 
transfer limit on Mrs Ws account, she set up the payments so that £10,000 would be sent to 
each recipient each day until the total amount she wanted to pay had been sent. 
But Mrs W says the transactions didnt go through smoothly. She says NatWest held up 
several of the payments for security checks, causing her a great deal of stress and 
inconvenience. She received multiple text messages from NatWest, some in the middle of 
the night, and had to speak to its fraud department several times. She says she received 
several automated calls from NatWest and spent a lot of time on hold waiting to get through 
to an agent.
Mrs W says that the first checks were carried out on 27 July 2021. She says she explained 
to NatWests fraud department on that date what the payments were, who the recipients 
were and that there would be a series of payments going out to those two recipients. She 
says NatWest told her that there wouldnt be any issues with the later payments after the first 
ones had been authorised. But that wasnt the case.
Mrs W received further text messages and calls after 27 July, while she was on holiday, 
which caused her further stress and inconvenience. She cancelled the remaining scheduled 
payments so that her holiday wasnt interrupted further. Mrs W then made a CHAPS 
payment to each recipient. These werent subject to a daily limit, so just one CHAPS 
payment was needed for each recipient.
When Mrs W complained, NatWest said it had followed its fraud prevention strategy correctly 
and acted in line with the terms and conditions of Mrs Ws account. It said that its system 
sends alerts to customers phones at the time a payment is flagged for a check, which can 
be at any time of the day or night. But it apologised for the upset caused to Mrs W by 
sending messages in the early hours of the morning and said it had provided feedback to its 
customer experience team about the timing of messages.
NatWest said its automated system calls the customer following an alert and, if the customer 
answers, the system connects them to an agent once an agent is available. It explained that 
it was experiencing higher call volumes at the time, which affected call waiting times.
NatWest said that its agent shouldnt have told Mrs W that future payments would go 
through straight away, because the agent had no way of knowing what the automated 
system would flag up for a security check. NatWest apologised for this.
It refunded the CHAPS fees and, after further communication from Mrs W, it has paid her 
compensation of £250. Mrs W says thats not enough for the distress caused and the fact 
that her family holiday was ruined. She asked this service to look into it.
Our Investigator didnt think NatWest needed to do any more here. But Mrs W didnt agree 
and asked for her complaint to be reviewed by an Ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs W used online banking to set up a series of payments to two recipients, as the amount 
of money she wanted to send exceeded the daily limit on payments from her account. This is 
in line with the suggestion on NatWests website, which says If you need to make a large 
value payment above the maximum payment limit, you can set up separate payments over a 
number of days. So it was reasonable for Mrs W to approach the payments in this way. 
In response to this complaint, NatWest has said that any large or unusual transactions can 
be stopped for further investigation in order to protect the customer and the bank from 
financial harm. I think thats also reasonable and I dont find it to be inconsistent with the 
suggestion on the website of making separate payments over several days.
NatWest has explained that its automated system picked up Mrs Ws transactions because 
they matched fraud trends it was seeing at the time. It says the transactions were stopped 
until NatWest could discuss them with Mrs W and make sure they were authorised by her. I 
think thats reasonable.
NatWest discussed the first transactions with Mrs W on 27 July. It was satisfied they were 
authorised by her as it allowed those payments to go through after speaking to her. Mrs W 
says she explained the nature of the transactions to NatWest on that occasion and told it 
that there would be a series of payments going out to those recipients. Ive no reason to 
doubt this. So Ive considered whether it was reasonable for NatWest to stop further 
transactions, having had this conversation with Mrs W. 
Id expect NatWest to have security measures and procedures in place to safeguard its 
customers accounts. As to exactly what those measures are and how theyre carried out, 
thats for NatWest as a business to decide. It has explained that it has an automated system 
in place to detect any unusual or suspicious payments. NatWest says it cant guarantee that 
payments to a previous recipient will go through without being stopped because the system 
wont know that the previous transactions were genuine. Once the payments had been 
stopped, NatWests procedures required it to obtain verification from Mrs W before they 
could be sent. I dont think thats unreasonable. 
I can appreciate the frustration Mrs W experienced at further payments being stopped. But, 
having put a fraud prevention strategy in place, its reasonable that NatWest followed it 
through. As our Investigator explained, this service doesnt have the power to tell NatWest to 
change its systems or policies. But we can look at whether it applied them correctly and 
fairly. 
The terms and conditions of Mrs Ws account allow NatWest to delay or refuse to act on her 
instructions if it reasonably believes she didnt authorise the instruction, it reasonably 
suspects the instruction is fraudulent or its necessary to protect her or NatWest from a 
crime. Here, its system (which is designed to detect unusual or suspicious transactions) had 
flagged up payments for checks. So I think it was reasonable for NatWest to stop those payments until it had checked them with Mrs W, particularly as it says the payments 
appeared to match fraud trends it was seeing at the time. I find that NatWest was acting 
within the terms and conditions here. It was also following its usual procedures and I havent 
seen anything to suggest that it followed them incorrectly. 
NatWest apologised for the distress caused by sending messages to Mrs W in the early 
hours of the morning. It explained why this happened but said it would provide feedback to 
the relevant team. I think thats fair and I dont think it needs to do any more about that.
But I think NatWest did make a mistake by telling Mrs W that future payments would go 
through without any issues. NatWest accepts that this was incorrect, as the agent couldnt 
have known what transactions might be flagged up by its system. NatWest has apologised 
for this mistake. It initially paid Mrs W compensation of £100 but, after further contact from 
her, it paid her a further £150. So NatWest has paid Mrs W compensation of £250 in total as 
well as refunding the CHAPS fees.
Its very difficult to put a monetary value on the distress and inconvenience caused by a 
situation like this. Our awards arent intended to punish a business but to reflect the impact 
the situation had on the customer and put that right, so far as possible. Mrs W has described 
the effect this situation had at what was already a very stressful time. Im sorry to hear about 
how it affected her. The experience was frustrating and upsetting, interrupting her holiday 
with messages and calls at all times of the day and night and putting her to trouble. 
But I have to be impartial, so Ive balanced this against the fact that NatWest has a duty to 
protect Mrs Ws account and was following its fraud prevention policy. Taking everything into 
account, I think £250 is a fair amount of compensation here, together with the refunded 
CHAPS fees. Im sorry to disappoint Mrs W, but Im not going to ask NatWest to do any 
more.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I dont uphold this complaint as I think NatWest has already done 
enough to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 June 2022.
