K820x#14complaint
Miss C says Barclays  Bank UK PLC (Barclays) mis-sold her a Current  Account Plus 
packaged bank  account and a Travel pack.  Shes used a Claims Management Company 
(CMC) to make her complaint.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  at Miss Cs complaint and didnt think  Barclays had 
mis-sold the Current Account Plus or the Travel pack. The CMC disagreed and asked for an 
ombudsmans decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Miss Cs complaint. 
I think Miss C freely  chose to take the Current Account Plus and the Travel pack and she 
couldve used the benefits included. And while Im open to the possibility Miss C wasnt 
provided with everything she shouldve been, I havent seen anything  to suggest clearer  
information wouldve  changed her decision to take the packages  in the first place. So, in 
these circumstances,  Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Miss Cs complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 April 2019.
