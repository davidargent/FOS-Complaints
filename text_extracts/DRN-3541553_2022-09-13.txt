The complaint
Mr D complains that he was charged late payment fees by Capital One (Europe) plc 
(CapOne).
What happened
Mr D had a credit card with CapOne. In February 2022, the balance was £261.61. In October 
2021, the minimum monthly payment of £9.95 was due by 6 October 2021, but it was paid 
on 7 October 2021. A late fee of £12 was charged.
Mr D complained. He said he had set up a direct debit for the amount to be paid, but due to 
a technical problem on the part of CapOne, it didnt collect the money. He then went onto his 
mobile banking app and paid the amount, but a late fee was still charged. He said CapOne 
should refund the charge, but they had refused. Because of the fee, the debt was now 
mounting up. He says his credit file is now affected.
CapOne said the payment was received after the due date of 6 October 2021, and therefore 
a late fee was charged in line with the terms and conditions of the account. There wasnt a 
record of Mr D logging onto his mobile banking app to set up a direct debit, nor had he called 
CapOne to set one up over the phone. They said that in November 2021, the balance was 
£225.90 and there were arrears of £49.43.
Mr D brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said CapOne acted reasonably. She 
looked at CapOnes mobile banking log  and found there wasnt any activity by Mr D 
between 12 September 2021 until 7 October 2021. And for a direct debit to have been 
effective, it would needed to have been set up by 29 September 2021 in order for it to claim 
the money from Mr Ds bank account. And - the activity on Mr Ds mobile banking in 
September 2021 didnt show a direct debit request was made. She said that the late 
payment markers were correctly advised to the credit reference agencies as accurate 
information. She didnt consider that CapOne had to agree to put a hold on Mr Ds account 
while he disputed the fee.
Mr D didnt agree. He asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint. He said he wont be 
paying any money to CapOne until they refund the fees.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen Mr Ds correspondence with our investigator. So at the outset let me say  we are 
an informal dispute resolution service which seeks to come to fair decisions where there is a 
complaint from a consumer about a financial business. We dont take sides. And Ive looked 
at all the evidence here in coming to a decision.
Mr D says he set up a direct debit, but due to a technical issue with CapOne, it wasnt 
collected when it shouldve been  on 6 October 2021, when the payment of £9.95 was due. 
And when he realised this, he made a payment in the middle of the night (on 7 October 
2021). He says CapOne were at fault and should refund the fee. He has said to us, and on 
calls to CapOne (which we have listened to) that he wont pay Capone if the fee isnt 
refunded. He also says that CapOne should put a hold on his account while the dispute is 
running.
Ive looked at the mobile log on data for Mr D. And he didnt log onto his mobile banking app 
between 12 September 2021 until 7 October 2021. So, during that time  he didnt set up a 
direct debit. And when he did log on before 12 September 2021  he didnt set up a direct 
debit either. And looking at CapOnes call records, he didnt call to set up a direct debit that 
way. And  such is the way that banking systems work  a direct debit wouldve needed to 
be set up by 29 September 2021 for it to be collected by 6 October 2021. And  there isnt 
any evidence it was set up by then.
I can see that Mr D then logged on at 0831 on 7 October 2021  and made the payment of 
£9.95, but that was a day late. So - CapOne charged a fee for late payment of £12. Ive 
thought about whether CapOne should refund this as a gesture of goodwill. But Ive also 
seen that they refunded late payment fees five times in the previous 12 months  and so 
took the position that theyd done enough in terms of refunds in the past. I can see from Mr 
Ds statements that was the case. And he had regularly paid late and was charged such 
fees. And so  I think that was a reasonable thing for CapOne to say.
Mr D has also said that CapOne wouldnt put his account on hold while the dispute was 
running. But  in the round, I can see that CapOne had been supportive in the past  they 
agreed payment plans (with reduced payments) in November 2020; February 2021; and 
March 2021. And on 16 November 2021, CapOne agreed a payment plan of £11 per month 
for a period of 12 months. So overall, they had supported Mr D. Mr D says that a hold on all 
payments should be agreed while he disputed the fee  but I dont think it would be 
reasonable to expect CapOne to agree to that.
CapOne have reported the late payments to the credit reference agencies  and they must 
do that as part of their obligations to record accurate information. So  Im not going to ask 
for the markers to be removed.
Mr D has said he wont make any more payments to CapOne unless the fee is refunded. He 
hasnt made a payment since 7 October 2021 up to February 2022. The balance in February 
2022 was £261.61, and that money is owed by Mr D  so I dont think its a reasonable 
stance for him to take  as this decision says that CapOne acted reasonably. And he does 
owe the money. So  I think it would be sensible that he resumes his payments and follows 
the payment plan thats been agreed in November 2021 (or any other agreement that has 
been out in place since then).
I can see that Mr D feels strongly about his complaint. But I think CapOne acted reasonably 
and I wont be asking them to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 October 2022.
