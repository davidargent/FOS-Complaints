Mrs G says Elevate Credit International Limited T/A Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about five short term loans Sunny provided to Mrs G between 
22 November 2016 to 1 May 2017. Mrs Gs borrowing history is as follows  (I have  rounded 
the figures for ease of reference):

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mrs Gs complaint. He didn't think loans  1 to 3 should be 
upheld but did think loans 4 and 5 shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and the 
complaint was passed to me. 
Mrs Gs representative didn't provide anything further for my consideration. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs G could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN25095662But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs G could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Gs complaint.  I wont  be looking at loans 1 to 3. 
Mrs G didn't provide  anything further to the adjudicators opinion that these three  loans 
shouldnt be upheld.
In November 2016, when Mrs G first borrowed from Sunny, she declared  a relatively low 
monthly income of £563. It remained the same  when she took loan 2. When  Mrs G took loan 
3 her monthly income  had increased to £932 but loans 1 and 2 were still outstanding.  And 
for loan 4 I accept that loan 1 had been  paid off the day before but loans 2 and 3 were  still 
outstanding and still had five months to run.
At that point the monthly cost of the loans was £133 from what was still a relatively modest 
declared monthly income of less than £950.  There hadnt been  any breaks in the borrowing 
in the previous five months  during which time Mrs G was indebted to Sunny and her 
indebtedness was growing. 
With all of this in mind, Sunny should have been doing a much more thorough review of 
Mrs Gs financial  situation to make  sure it understood whether Mrs G would be able to 
sustainably repay  loan 4, and shortly  afterwards loan 5.
Ref: DRN25095663I think the fact that Mrs G had several  loans running  concurrently, and taken within  such a 
short time period,  might  also have suggested  she was having problems with managing  her 
finances. And if Sunny had done what I deem  to be proportionate checks at the point Mrs G 
applied for loan 4, it would have  had a much  clearer  understanding of her financial situation 
and realised Mrs G was struggling. 
Ive had the opportunity to see Mrs Gs bank statements and from these I see there were a 
substantial number of transactions with on-line gambling businesses. And in these 
circumstances, I dont  think  it was likely  Mrs G would be able to sustainably  repay her loans.  
So in conclusion I am upholding Mrs Gs complaint that she shouldnt  have given loans 4 
and 5. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs G paid on loans 4 and 5;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about 4 and 5 from Mrs Gs credit  file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs G a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Gs complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited T/A Sunny should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 January 2020.
