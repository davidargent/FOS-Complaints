Complaint
Miss H has complained about loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) 
provided to her. She says the loans were unaffordable and shouldnt have been lent.
Background
118 118 Money provided Miss H with an initial loan for £1,000.00 in February 2019. This 
loan had an APR of 79.9% and a term of 18 months. This meant that the total amount to be 
repaid of £1,512.54, including interest, fees and charges of £512.54, was due to be repaid in 
18 monthly instalments of just under £85. 
118 118 Money then provided Miss H with a second loan, for £3,500.00, in April 2022. This 
loan had an APR of 79.9% and a term of 12 months. This meant that the total amount to be 
repaid of £4,800.60, including interest, fees and charges of £1,300.60, was due to be repaid 
in 12 monthly instalments of just over £400. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed Miss Hs complaint and he thought 118 118 Money hadnt 
done anything wrong when providing loan 1, but that it ought to have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided Miss H with loan 2. So he thought that Miss Hs complaint should be 
partially upheld. 
Miss H didnt disagree with our adjudicators assessment. And 118 118 Money didnt 
respond at all so the case was passed to an ombudsman for a final decision as per the next 
stage of our dispute resolution process.
As there no longer appears to be a dispute over loan 1, this decision is only looking at 
whether 118 118 Money acted fairly and reasonably when providing loan 2 to Miss H. And 
any reference made to loan from this point onwards is made with reference to loan 2.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Miss Hs complaint. 
Having carefully considered everything Ive decided to uphold Miss Hs complaint. Ill explain 
why in a little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
is 118 118 Money needed to find out enough about Miss H such that it could have a 
reasonable understanding of whether Miss H could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
The information 118 118 Money has provided suggested that it carried out credit checks 
before both loans were provided. The credit check prior to loan 2 showed that Miss Hs 
indebtedness had grown significantly since she applied for loan 1. 
So I think that 118 118 Money ought to have obtained more further information from Miss H 
in order to have been able to make an informed decision on whether to lend to her. 
Furthermore, its clear from the additional information Ive seen that Miss Hs existing 
expenditure meant that she was always going to struggle to make the necessary payments  
particularly in light of the proportion of her income that they would be taking up.
 
Overall and having considered everything, Im persuaded by what Miss H has said about 
already being in a difficult financial position at the time she took out loan 2. And while its 
possible Miss Hs indebtedness reflected her choices rather than financial difficulty, Id add 
that my experience of these types of cases suggest this is unlikely, in the absence of any 
reasonable or plausible arguments from 118 118 Money, Ive been persuaded to accept   
Miss Hs version of events. 
As this is the case, I do think that Miss Hs existing financial position meant that she was 
unlikely to be able to afford the payments to loan 2, without suffering adverse consequences 
or borrowing further. 
And Im satisfied that reasonable enquiries into Miss Hs circumstances would more like than 
not have shown 118 118 Money that it shouldnt have provided loan 2 to her. As 118 118 
Money provided Miss H with loan 2, notwithstanding this, Im satisfied it failed to act fairly 
and reasonably towards her. 
Miss H has ended up paying and is being expected to pay interest, fees and charges on a 
loan she shouldnt have been provided with. So Im satisfied that Miss H lost out because of 
what 118 118 Money did wrong and that it should put things right.
Fair compensation  what 118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Miss H
Having thought about everything, 118 118 Money should put things right for Miss H by:
removing all interest, fees and charges applied to loan 2 from the outset. The 
payments Miss H made, whether to 118 118 Money or any third-party debt 
purchaser, should be deducted from the new starting balance  the £3,500.00 
originally lent. If Miss H has already paid more than £3,500.00 on this loan then    
118 118 Money should treat any extra as overpayments. And any overpayments 
should be refunded to Miss H;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any overpayments, if any, from the date 
they were made by Miss H to the date of settlement;
if no outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, all adverse 
information 118 118 Money recorded about this loan should be removed from          
Miss Hs credit file. HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Miss H a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for 
one.
Id also remind 118 118 Money of its obligation to exercise forbearance and due 
consideration, in the event it decides to collect on any outstanding balance and it be the 
case that Miss H is experiencing financial difficulty. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Miss Hs complaint. Madison CF UK Limited 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 October 2023.
