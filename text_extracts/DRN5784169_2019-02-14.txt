K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that Phoenix Life Assurance Limited failed to pay the required bonus  on his 
late wifes  with-profits  policy.  He said that recent statements showed a final bonus  of around 
£60,000 which was not applied.
background
An adjudicator at this service  did not feel his complaint  should  be upheld.
He noted that Phoenix had said that the policy commenced as a non-profits policy in 1979 
and then converted to a with-profits one in 1984. It had then issued several  mistaken 
statements which did not reflect that the policy attracted  simple  bonuses. It said this was 
due to a clerical error which  wrongly  generated final bonus statements.
Overall, the adjudicator was satisfied that this was simply a mistake and that the previous  
statements, notably the one in 2014,  showed a final bonus was not on the cards. He 
therefore felt there was no evidence to indicate  Phoenix had paid out the wrong  sum.
He also said Mr C was not entitled  to the 2017 annual bonus as Mrs C died before the 
relevant eligibility  date;  albeit just eight days previously.
He said Phoenix  has offered  Mr C £500  in lieu of the trouble and upset  this issue  had 
caused Mr C plus £50 for the delay in dealing with his complaint.
Mr C did not accept this, and said:
He has copies of statements  dating  back to 1989  which  show  annual bonuses and 
final bonus figures, and enclosed  a handwritten  account of what the statements 
showed
He enclosed a 2009 statement which stated that final bonuses  were possible on this 
policy and that the current projected  bonus was £597 (but this statement  also said 
that final bonuses  were not guaranteed)
The statements for 2015 and 2016 showed  final bonus figures of £45,000 and 
£60,000 respectively
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I fully understand  Mr Cs disappointment at the apparent dramatic  collapse in the final bonus 
from £60,000 in 2016 to nil the following year but, given all the evidence provided, I think 
Phoenixs explanation is reasonable and very likely to be correct.
Firstly, all the statements sent to Mr Cs wife made  clear that terminal bonuses were  optional 
and that there was no guarantee of one, let alone a specific sum.
Ref: DRN57841692Secondly, many of the statements showed very modest, if any, predicted final bonuses on 
this policy. For example, the 2008 statement projected a £597 bonus while the 2012,  2013 
and 2014 statements said that no final bonuses were currently projected.
I would be very surprised if a policy predicted  to deliver no final bonus for three years in a 
row would suddenly perform to such a degree  that it could be predicted  to deliver a £45,000 
bonus a year later in 2015 or £60,000 in 2016.  All this suggests that Phoenixs 2015  and 
2016 statements  were  wrong, as it claimed.
Having sought  a further breakdown about Mr Cs pay-out, Ive seen no persuasive evidence 
that it paid out the wrong amount. Given this, I believe Mr C was not entitled to anything  
more than he received  and that while Phoenix clearly  made  mistakes, its payment of £550  I 
lieu of these was not unreasonable.
  
my final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2019.
