The complaint
Miss W complains that Advantage Insurance Company Limited provided poor service when 
she made a claim on her motor insurance policy after an accident.
What happened
As the facts are well known to the parties and arent disputed, I wont repeat them here.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Advantage offered Miss W £150 after accepting that shed been inconvenienced by poor 
contact from it and by initial poor work on the part of its repairer. But I think that sum failed to 
reflect that Miss Ws car still wasnt in good condition after the garage carried out rectification 
work. Miss W faced further disappointment and inconvenience as a result. She then had to 
find another repairer. Her car was off the road three times rather than once - and the matter 
dragged on far longer than it would have done had the repairer done the work correctly in 
the first place - or when given the chance to rectify it. Miss C was given a small courtesy car, 
in line with the policys terms, so although she needed a larger one, I cant say Advantage 
was at fault for that. But I think a further £250 compensation for the overall avoidable 
inconvenience and upset Miss W faced would be appropriate in  the circumstances here.    
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I require Advantage Insurance Company 
Limited to pay Miss W a further £250 compensation for distress and inconvenience (£400 in 
total). Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to 
accept or reject my decision before 17 March 2022.
