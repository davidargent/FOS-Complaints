The complaint
Mr P complained that National Westminster Bank Plc took too long to deal with his complaint 
about a fraud against his account. He also wants more compensation than NatWest gave 
him for customer service issues.
What happened
On 15 January 2021, Mr P rang NatWest and said that he hadnt authorised four online debit 
card transactions. Two were on his previous debit card and had taken place in late 
November 2020, and two were on his current debit card and took place on 13 and 15 
January 2021. The total was £101.76.
Mr P also disputed two payments to credit reporting firms, but the adviser explained that Mr 
P would need to contact those firms direct. He provided Mr P with the contact details for 
those.
The adviser cancelled Mr Ps debit card, and the device from which the payments had been 
made. He ordered a replacement card. One of the transactions hadnt yet debited the 
account, and the adviser said NatWest would start the investigation when that had 
happened. It should then take 5 business days to investigate, and NatWest would then 
phone Mr P with the outcome. 
At the same time, the adviser emailed Mr P the forms to dispute the transactions. On 19 
January, Mr P rang for help completing these forms. The adviser again told Mr P about the 
timescales.
On 20 January, NatWest sent a text, explaining that an extension had been applied to the 
investigation, because it needed more information from the retailer.
On 23 January, Mr P complained. NatWest replied to the complaint the same day. It said it 
didnt agree that when Mr P raised the fraud case, he should have been told there might be 
an extension past the 5 days. It said it only notified customers of any extension after one had 
been approved, and it had sent Mr P a text.
NatWest did, however, agree that when Mr P had asked to be passed to the complaints 
team, hed been put through to the fraud team instead. It noted that Mr P said that another 
adviser had said the fraud investigation could take between 5 and 7 working days. NatWest 
credited Mr Ps account with £60 compensation. A few days later, it refunded him with the 
disputed amounts. 
Mr P wasnt satisfied and complained to this service. He said he had hoped to get his money 
back on time and it had affected him mentally and financially, as hed spent money on his 
credit card.
Meanwhile, NatWest took the decision to close Mr Ps account.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Ps complaint. She pointed out that Mr P had received a 
new debit card within 5 days of reporting the disputed transactions. She considered an 
extension had been reasonable, and pointed out that Mr P had received a refund for the 
disputed transactions as well as £60 compensation. 
Mr P wasnt satisfied. He said he hadnt been aware how long it would take for NatWest to 
refund him. And £60 wasnt acceptable compensation, because hed been told different 
things by different NatWest advisers. Mr P said the investigator had based her decision on 
the fact NatWest had closed his account.
The investigator replied to Mr P. She pointed out that NatWest couldnt have known at the 
start that it would need an extension. NatWest had refunded Mr P for the disputed 
transactions on 3 February, and she considered the short extension was reasonable. She 
said this service recommends modest amount of compensation. And she said she hadnt 
based her decision on the fact that NatWest had subsequently closed Mr Ps account. Shed 
included this as one of the known facts about the case. 
Mr P didnt accept this and asked for an ombudsman decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Whether or not NatWest took too long to investigate the disputed transactions
Ive listened to Mr Ps call on Friday 15 January 2021, and as Ive set out above, he was told 
that one of the transactions hadnt yet debited the account, and NatWest would start the 
investigation when that had happened. It should then take 5 business days to investigate. 
This would bring the date to at least Friday 22 January, depending when the last pending 
transaction debited the account. On 20 January, NatWest sent Mr P the text saying an 
extension was needed. So that was within the timescales Mr P had been told.
I accept that NatWest couldnt have known in advance whether or not it would need an 
extension. With a fraud case, it was important to investigate in full and take whatever time 
was needed. It isnt always possible to give an exact timescale. So I dont find NatWest had 
been required to warn Mr P, when he first rang, that an extension might be needed.
I also find the subsequent timescales reasonable. NatWest sent Mr P a new debit card on 18 
January, and Mr P must have received it promptly because he used it on 20 January. 
NatWest also responded to Mr Ps complaint the same day that he raised it, and it paid him 
£60 compensation and refunded the disputed transactions only a few days later. 
I note that Mr P has said he had a financial loss because hed spent money on his credit 
card and needed the money  though he hasnt provided evidence to support this. But in any 
case, I consider NatWests timescales were reasonable. Fraud needs full investigation and 
Mr P received the refunds on 3 February, less than three weeks after raising the dispute. 
So I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint about delays. I find that NatWest doesnt have to pay Mr 
P any compensation for delays.
Compensation Mr P wants more compensation than the £60 NatWest paid him for an employee passing 
him to the fraud team instead of the complaints team, and for giving conflicting information 
about how long the fraud investigation would take. But I consider that £60 is more than fair 
for any inconvenience from these issues in the circumstances of this case.
Finally, Mr P said he believes the investigator based her decision on the fact NatWest had 
subsequently decided to close his account and stop providing him with banking facilities. 
She replied that she mentioned this because it was part of the history and events of the 
account. I also confirm that I have based my decision on the facts of the fraud investigation 
and NatWests customer service, not on what happened later.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 September 2021.
