The complaint
Mr C complains about what happened when he asked National Westminster Bank Plc to 
remortgage his Buy To Let (BTL) property. He said NatWest had agreed to keep a 
mortgage offer open for him, but then told him it had expired, and it would no longer lend. 
What happened
Mr C said he approached NatWest to remortgage a BTL leasehold property, with a relatively 
short lease period remaining. He said hed asked NatWest before applying, and was told the 
remaining time on this lease wouldnt rule him out of NatWests lending criteria. But NatWest 
then told him he had to extend the lease before it would lend to him. 
Mr C said NatWest told him it would honour his original mortgage deal, if he got the lease 
extended. But then once this was done, NatWest changed its mind. It said it had to restart 
Mr Cs application, and it told him this time hed failed the credit check. So it would no longer 
lend to him. Mr C said he didnt understand that, as nothing had changed on his credit file. 
Mr C said hed paid for an unnecessary lease extension, which cost almost £2,000. And he 
could no longer get a mortgage at anything like the rate NatWest initially suggested. Mr C 
wanted NatWest to honour his original deal, and pay the costs of extending the lease. 
NatWest said it didnt rule Mr C out of lending just because of the remaining term of the 
lease. But the valuation it received on the property in January 2022 put the value at nil (for 
lending purposes) because of the number of years remaining on the lease. NatWest said its 
valuers then confirmed that if the lease was extended, the lending value would be £200,000. 
NatWest said in August 2022, it got confirmation that the lease had been extended, so it 
reconsidered Mr Cs application. Because of the time that had passed, it needed to look at 
the whole application again. And it said, unfortunately, Mr C no longer passed its credit 
scoring. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He noted that the nil valuation 
on Mr Cs property was due to the lease, and NatWest said it would need to be extended for 
the application to go ahead. Mr C was initially reluctant to do this, he said it wasnt really 
worth it unless he was selling the property, but he eventually agreed. 
When Mr C supplied details of the lease extension, in late August 2022, NatWest restarted 
his application, but said it then failed. Mr C said he wasnt told another application would 
need to be restarted after six months. 
Our investigator said that its important to remember that Mr Cs mortgage had only got to 
the application stage, when the valuation was done. And the result of the valuation meant 
NatWest couldnt then proceed further until the lease extension was confirmed. 
Our investigator didnt think NatWest did anything wrong by restarting Mr Cs application, 
once the lease extension was done. He said we couldnt override NatWests decision not to 
lend. And he thought it was likely Mr C wouldve had to pay for the lease extension to get a 
mortgage from any lender. But our investigator said NatWest should have made Mr C aware 
that the application would need to be restarted after six months, and NatWest accepted it 
hadnt told Mr C this. So he said NatWest should pay Mr C £250 in compensation.
NatWest accepted that, but Mr C didnt. He replied to say that a payment of £250 was a 
complete insult from a bank which made £524 million in profit last year, and it didnt cover his 
losses. Mr C said this mortgage product did allow for a lease of 60 years, thats why hed 
chosen NatWest. And he said NatWest wouldnt tell him why hed failed the credit score, so 
he could address that. 
Mr C said if hed got the mortgage he originally applied for, he would be paying £163 a 
month fixed for the next 5 years. He told us he hadnt secured another fixed rate mortgage 
deal, and was now on a variable rate currently paying £583.98. He thought that was 
NatWests fault.
Our investigator didnt change his mind. He said compensation awarded by our service isnt 
aligned to a business profits, its based on the circumstances of the complaint. And he said 
NatWest doesnt have to tell Mr C exactly why it didnt want to lend. 
Mr C had asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman, so the case was then 
passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
Mr C said NatWest hadnt indicated that it would reject his application because of the length 
of the remaining lease on his property. But it doesnt look like NatWest did just reject the 
application because of this. Rather, it took account of what its valuer said, and relied on their 
professional opinion about the impact that this lease had on the propertys value and resale 
prospects. NatWest itself isnt an expert on property values, and I dont think its wrong for 
NatWest to rely on the professional advice it commissions. Here, I can see that NatWest 
discussed the issue further with its valuers, and said it would be able to continue with the 
application if the lease was extended. 
NatWests notes show Mr C wanted to be reassured that the previously agreed deal would 
go ahead, and an offer would be made, after the lease was extended. I can see NatWest 
said at the time that it hadnt made any offer to Mr C. But this was already more than three 
months after Mr C first made his application, and legal work like this can take some time. So, 
given the concerns Mr C had expressed, I do think it would have been helpful for NatWest to 
warn Mr C that his application would lapse after six months and would need to be restarted 
then. 
NatWest has agreed to pay £250 in compensation for not managing Mr Cs expectations at 
this point. Mr C thought NatWest should honour the mortgage deal hed previously 
discussed with it. But Mr C hadnt secured an offer from NatWest before he extended his 
lease, and I cant see it had made any commitment to keep this deal in place for him. NatWest then checked Mr Cs application in full again when he did get the lease extended. It 
was more than six months since hed previously applied, so I think it was reasonable for 
NatWest not to rely on the credit checks it did so long ago. 
When NatWest checked again, it said Mr C no longer passed its credit checks. I know that 
Mr C would like to know exactly why that is, but it isnt unreasonable for NatWest not to 
share the detail here of exactly how it works out who it can lend to, and why he didnt pass at 
this stage. 
Mr C also wanted NatWest to pay for the costs he incurred in extending his lease. But I do 
think the lease extension has a value for Mr C, as it increases the value of his property and 
should make it easier to get a mortgage deal in future. So I dont think it would be fair and 
reasonable for me to ask NatWest to pay for that. 
In summary, I do think that the payment of £250 which NatWest has agreed to make would 
provide a fair and reasonable outcome to Mr Cs complaint. So thats what Ill now award.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must pay Mr C £250 in 
compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 October 2023.
