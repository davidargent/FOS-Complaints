K820x#14complaint
Miss S complains  that J D Williams & Company Limited (trading as Simply  Be) kept 
increasing her credit  limit without doing proper affordability checks.
background
Miss S had two catalogue shopping accounts with J D Williams (trading as Simply Be and as 
Fashion World). Both accounts were opened in 2016, with initial credit limits of £125 and 
£150. She made the minimum payments each month, starting at £10 a month. Her credit  
limits were  regularly increased  until they reached £1,250  and £1,500 respectively  ten times 
what they were at the start. Eventually she failed to keep up with her payments, and so the 
debts were sold to a third party.
Miss S complained to J D Williams, saying  that when she applied for the accounts she 
already had defaults and missed payments on her credit file. But J D Williams  did not uphold  
her complaint. It said she had kept up to date with her payments  until the last limit increases, 
and it had not increased the limits while she was in financial difficulty. So Miss S brought  this 
complaint to our Service.
J D Williams said it had done  proper  affordability  checks with a credit reference agency, and 
that Miss S had passed  them, but our investigator  said that J D Williams had not provided 
enough evidence  to prove this. So she upheld this complaint, and recommended  that J D 
Williams refund all interest and charges. J D Williams asked for an ombudsmans decision.
I wrote  a provisional decision which read as follows.
my provisional findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Records supplied  by J D Williams show that the credit limits were  increased as follows:
Ref: DRN81296592Date of limit increase £125 initially £150 initially
1 October 2016 £250
29 October 2016 £400
22 December 2016 £600
21 January 2017 £750
11 March 2017 £225
8 April 2018 £400
6 May 2017 £600
3 June 2017 £900
10 June 2017 £1,000
1 July 2017 £1,250
5 August 2017 £1,500
Miss S mostly made full use of her credit limit on the second account. But she made less use 
of the first account,  and her balance on that account  increased  more slowly. She mostly 
made small  repayments on her accounts, although I can see that she paid £100 into each 
account in May 2017, and paid another £100  to one account in July. Her balances rarely  
decreased. At the end of 2017, she exceeded  her credit limit on both accounts, and began  to 
regularly miss her payments, incurring charges.
J D Williams says that each time it increased a credit limit, it did a creditworthiness  check  
using information  provided by a credit reference  agency (as well as considering  its own 
data). At the time of the first increase,  it had been 32 months since Miss Ss last default. J D 
Williams says that each time,  the outcome was positive. I have noted that her level of 
indebtedness was usually recorded as medium to high, which  is a factor  in favour of 
upholding this complaint. But balanced  against that is the fact that, at the time of the last 
increase on the first account, the total amount she had repaid on that account was equal  to 
about 49.5%  of her total outstanding balance on that account, which  suggests  to me that she 
was managing her account. The equivalent figure on the second account is 42.5%. She was 
not and had not been in arrears.
J D Williams has said that it starts its customers off on limits which  it calculates  are lower 
than they can afford,  and then gradually increases them. I have seen  the account 
statements, and I think that the payment histories  demonstrate that the credit limits were 
affordable to begin with. There was nothing at the time to suggest that Miss S was 
struggling. On the other hand,  she mostly only made small payments which did little to 
reduce her account  balances, which generally increased over time.  Not long after the last 
increase  which brought the total credit  limit to £2,750  she got into difficulties and began 
to miss payments. However, I note that this coincided with a decrease in her income, when 
she lost her entitlement to some benefits.  J D Williams wouldnt have known that that was 
going to happen when  it increased her credit  limits. This suggests that her financial 
difficulties were the result of intervening  events  which J D Williams  could not have foreseen. 
Had her income not decreased, I think she would probably not have got into difficulty.
There are some factors both for and against upholding this complaint. But on balance,  I am 
currently not persuaded that J D Williams lent to Miss S irresponsibly. She managed her 
accounts well enough until her circumstances changed and her income was reduced.
So my provisional decision is that I currently do not intend to uphold this complaint.
Ref: DRN81296593responses to my provisional  findings
Neither party had anything to add. So there is no reason for me to depart from my 
provisional findings, and I confirm them here.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 July 2020.
