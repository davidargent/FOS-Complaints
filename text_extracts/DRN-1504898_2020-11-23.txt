DRN-1504898
The complaint
Miss J complains about the adverse information that Home Retail Group Card Services 
Limited, trading as Argos Financial Services, has recorded on her credit file.
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Miss J doesnt dispute that she missed a payment that was due on her account with 
Argos Financial Services and it then recorded the late payment on her credit file;
Miss J says that she made a mistake and missed one payment and it was only for a 
small amount  but financial businesses are required to report true and accurate 
information about a customers account - and the information that Argos Financial 
Services has reported to the credit reference agencies is a true and accurate record 
of Miss Js payment history;
I sympathise with Miss J for the difficulties that shes been caused by these events 
and understand the frustration that she feels  but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that Argos Financial Services has acted incorrectly in 
connection with Miss Js account; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it 
to remove the late payment from Miss Js credit file or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Js complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2020.
