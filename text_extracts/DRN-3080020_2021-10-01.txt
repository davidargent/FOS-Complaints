The complaint
Mr W complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA didnt process a partial refund when 
he raised a dispute. 
  
What happened
In February 2021 Mr W raised a dispute as an item he had purchased via PayPal didnt 
work. Mr W submitted a dispute form that said the overall transaction amount was £309.40 
and he was asking for a refund of £199.95. 
The dispute was successful but PayPal refunded the full transaction amount of £309.40. 
Mr W complained and asked PayPal to refund the difference to the merchant. PayPal didnt 
agree or uphold Mr Ws complaint. Mr W referred his complaint to this service and it was 
passed to an investigator. They upheld the complaint and asked PayPal to refund the 
£109.45 difference to the merchant. 
PayPal didnt agree and said Mr W failed to mention a partial refund during the dispute 
process. PayPals response said it had attached evidence that Mr W asked for a full refund. 
But no evidence of that nature was received despite the investigator chasing PayPal for it. 
As PayPal didnt accept, Mr Ws complaint has been passed to me. 
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal says Mr W asked for a full refund of the total transaction value. But Ive seen the 
dispute form Mr W sent to PayPal and it confirms Mr W wanted a refund of £199.95, not the 
total value of the transaction. Despite the case handlers claims, no evidence to show Mr W 
asked for a full refund has been supplied. And Im satisfied the dispute form Mr W submitted 
to PayPal was sufficiently clear. I agree with Mr W that PayPal didnt process the dispute 
correctly and should only have refunded £199.95. 
Mr W responded to the investigator and said he hasnt made up the difference to the 
merchant. So the payment to the merchant remains outstanding. Our investigator asked 
PayPal to refund £109.45 to the merchant in order to resolve Mr Ws complaint. Im satisfied 
thats a fair approach so Im going to proceed on that basis.  
    
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to 
refund £109.45 to the merchant and contact Mr W to confirm once thats completed. 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 October 2021.
