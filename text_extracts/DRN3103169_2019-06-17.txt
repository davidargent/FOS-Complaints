K820x#14complaint
Mr W is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA lent money  to him that he says he 
could never  afford to repay. 
background
In December 2017, Mr W applied for a PayPal Credit facility. His application was accepted  
and he was given  a credit  limit of £2,500. He began to have difficulty meeting the 
repayments and in August 2018, complained that PayPal had been irresponsible to lend to 
him. He said PayPal had failed  to carry out sufficient  checks  to ensure the lending  was 
affordable for him. Mr W asked PayPal to wipe the debt and compensate him for the stress 
and worry it had caused.
PayPal didnt respond directly to Mr W so he referred his complaint to us. One of our 
adjudicators looked into it. She initially felt that, based on the information we had at the time, 
PayPal hadnt  done enough to ensure Mr W could afford  the credit  he was given. In 
response to her opinion  however, PayPal provided  much more information,  explained  its 
assessment process  and the checks that had been carried  out.  
As a result of the new information received from PayPal, our adjudicator changed  her view. 
She said PayPal had provided details of Mr Ws credit score at the time of the application, 
his level of debt and the total credit available to him that it had obtained through a credit 
search. Based on that and what Mr W had told them in his application, he met PayPals 
criteria for lending. Our adjudicator said on reflection, she was satisfied  that PayPals checks 
had been proportionate  and that the information it had didnt support Mr Ws view that the 
credit was unaffordable. 
Mr W didnt agree. He provided a letter from an investigator at our service on another  similar 
complaint about  a different business, who at the time, had upheld his complaint. 
As there was no agreement, Mr Ws complaint has been  passed to me for a final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear from what Ive seen that Mr W has found himself in a difficult position  having 
borrowed money from a number of sources. I have a great deal of empathy with the position  
he finds himself  in. But my role is to decide if PayPal dealt with his application  for lending 
reasonably and made appropriate checks to ensure he could afford the facility at the time. 
Having carefully considered everything  he and PayPal have told us, I think it has. 
Mr W told PayPal  he was earning between  £4,001  and £4,500  per month  and had outgoings 
of up to £2,500  per month. The credit report PayPal  has provided from the time of the 
applications, showed Mr W had £6,992  of debt and had used 63% of the credit available  to 
him. His credit score was considered 'normal  too.
The lending Mr W had applied for was for making purchases online  it wasnt a cash  loan. 
Had it been, I mightve expected PayPal to consider why he needed a loan of £2,500  given 
the income and expenditure  hed quoted  suggested  he had a large disposable income. It 
Ref: DRN31031692mightve questioned why would someone  with a disposable income of at least £1,500 per 
month need a loan of £2,500?  But the facility applied for here was a way of allowing Mr W to 
buy items securely online and spread the cost. I dont think the same concerns would apply 
based on the information Mr W had given to PayPal and that it had sourced itself. 
I have looked  at the other complaint Mr W referred to in his correspondence with our 
adjudicator. It concerns  a different business  and a different type of credit.  I dont think  it has 
any bearing on the complaint that Ive considered  here.  
Overall, I think PayPal  carried out proportionate checks  to assess  Mr Ws application and set 
a credit limit based on the information  he provided and it obtained through  a credit search. I 
appreciate this will come as a disappointment to Mr W as he now finds himself  in a difficult  
financial position, but I dont think PayPal acted  unreasonably based  on the information it 
had at the time. I would  remind PayPal of its obligations to treat customers  who find 
themselves in financial difficulties positively and sympathetically.
my final decision
I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 July 2019.
