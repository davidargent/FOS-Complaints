Mrs R complains Santander  UK Plc wont pay her the balance in her recently discovered 
passbook.
background
At the beginning  of January 1994  Mrs R opened a savings account with Santanders 
predecessor. She recently found the passbook  which showed a balance  of £857.60. But 
when she went into the branch it said she only had £102.69 in the account. It updated her 
passbook and one of the entries said she withdrawn £775 in 2014. She says she didnt do 
this.
Santander said that because her passbook  hadnt  been updated  for over 20 years  the 
entries had been  consolidated. So the entry dated 2014 meant that between 24 January 
1994 and 17 August  2014 a total of £775.09 had been withdrawn. It sent her copies  of 
annual statements for the account  from 2014 to 2018 which  it said had previously been  sent 
to her by post. And as Mrs R had told it she hadnt  made these withdrawals it passed her 
case onto its Fraud Team  to investigate.
Our investigator didnt  think Santander  had done  anything wrong. She could  see from the 
statements and records that the balance in the account from 2009 onwards was much  less 
than the balance in 1994. So she thought  it was likely that the £775.09 had been withdrawn 
before 2009. And it couldve been  in one lump sum or several smaller amounts. So she 
didnt think Santander  was being unreasonable when it relied on the information it had which 
confirmed the balance in the account  was £102.69.
Mrs R was very disappointed by this. She said she hadnt withdrawn the money. And she 
couldnt understand why there  werent any records further back  than six years. Shed never 
received the annual statements.  And one of them  showed a cash  withdrawal and a cash 
deposit of £10 on the same day which she said was ridiculous.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
I can see how strongly Mrs R feels about  this so I know she will be disappointed with my 
decision. But Ive come to the same conclusion as the investigator  for very similar reasons.
Mrs R says she hasnt received any of the statements. But I cant  see that Santander has 
been sending  them to the wrong address. So I cant find its responsible  for any failings in 
the postal system. 
Banks arent  obliged  to keep records for more  than six years. So I cant say Santander was 
wrong not to be able to provide detailed transactions on Mrs Rs account before 2009. But 
the evidence it has provided shows that at the beginning of January 2009 there was £2.40 in 
Mrs Rs account. According to the annual statements a number of deposits  and a withdrawal 
were made up to 2018 when the balance  was £102.69. Looking  at all that information I cant  
find Santander has made any mistake in calculating the current balance.  
Ref: DRN29815092But Mrs R says she didnt use this account so the balance  shouldve been what it was in 
1994. In those circumstances Santander has said its referred her case  onto its Fraud  Team. 
And although I know Mrs R wont agree with me I cant ask it to do anything  more. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 February  2019.
