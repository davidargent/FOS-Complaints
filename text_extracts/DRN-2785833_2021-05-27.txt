The complaint
Miss P complains that Bank of Scotland plc, trading as Halifax, wont refund to her the 
money that she paid to a garage and the other costs that shes claimed. 
What happened
Miss P paid a garage to do some work on her car. She says that she returned to the garage 
a few days later and asked it to do an MOT test on the car. The car failed the MOT test, the 
garage did some work on the car and then re-tested it. It passed the MOT test and Miss P 
paid £354.61 to the garage, using her Halifax credit card, for the work including the MOT 
test. 
Miss P says that a warning light came on when she was driving home from the garage so 
she took the car to another garage and, later that month, she paid it £1,215.40 for the 
required repairs. She claimed a refund of the £354.61 and her consequential losses from 
Halifax under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. She wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He didnt feel that 
there was sufficient evidence to suggest that the garage hadnt provided the goods and 
services that Miss P had paid for and hadnt seen sufficient evidence that any of the actions 
taken by the garage led to the additional payments she made to the other garage. He also 
said that the garage wasnt provided the opportunity to investigate and potentially rectify 
those issues. He said that businesses arent required to raise chargebacks that have little 
chance of success and that he wouldnt be asking Halifax to take any further action.
Miss P has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has responded 
to the investigators recommendations in detail and says, in summary, that she took the car 
to the garage because of a noise issue - but it wasnt dealt with so she had to take the car to 
another garage. She says that she wouldnt have done so unless the issue hadnt been 
repaired and that theres been a breach of contract by the garage.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made but, if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
I consider that any chargeback claim made by Halifax would have been defended by 
the garage and that there wasnt a reasonable prospect of a successful chargeback 
claim in these circumstances  so Im not persuaded that Halifax acted incorrectly by 
not making a chargeback claim for Miss Ps payment to the garage;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Miss Ps complaint about Halifax, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the garage and that Halifaxs 
response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not 
determining the outcome of Miss Ps claim under section 75 as only a court would be 
able to do that;
Miss P paid £222 for the garage to supply and fit a replacement battery in March 
2020  theres no reference on the invoice for that work to a noise issue but the 
garage says that it discussed a knocking noise on the car with Miss P but it didnt 
consider it to be dangerous and wouldnt stop her from using the car  Ive seen no 
evidence to show that the garage tried to repair the noise issue or that it charged 
Miss P for doing so;
Miss P returned to the garage a few days later for an MOT test on her car  if she 
wasnt satisfied with the work that had been done a few days earlier, I dont consider 
it to be likely that she would have returned the car to the garage for an MOT test;
the car failed the MOT test because the exhaust was emitting visible smoke and the 
offside front anti-roll bar ball joint was excessively worn;
the garage repaired those faults and the car passed the MOT re-test  the garages 
invoice shows that it supplied some fuel additive and supplied and fitted a 
replacement ball joint and two link pins - and its charge for the work, including the 
MOT test, was £354.61;
theres no reference on that invoice to a repair of a noise issue  the invoice only 
related to the MOT test and the work required for the car to pass the re-test;
Miss P says in her complaint form that a warning light came on when she was driving 
home from the garage and that it was associated with what the garage had done as 
part of the MOT works  but shes also said that the noise issue continued;
she then took the car to another garage and paid it to do more work on the car  but 
the invoice for that work doesnt refer to a noise issue and I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect her to have returned the car to the garage for it to be given an 
opportunity to rectify any issues if she wasnt satisfied with the work that it had done;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the garages work 
wasnt of a reasonably acceptable standard or that theres been a breach of contract 
or misrepresentation by the garage;
I dont consider that Halifax responded to Miss Ps section 75 claim correctly, but Im 
not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to refund to 
Miss P any of the money that she paid to the garage or any of the other costs that 
shes claimed; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Halifax to refund any payments to Miss P, to pay her any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Ps complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 June 2021.
