K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that Gain Credit  LLC (trading  as Lending Stream) has incorrectly  calculated  
the amount due on his loan.
background
Mr S borrowed £400 from Lending Stream on 17 November 2017.  It was scheduled to be 
repaid with six instalments, the largest of which was £185.60. The final instalment was due 
on 24 May 2018. Mr S says he calculated how much he owed Lending Stream  based on 
settling the loan on 7 February 2018  and transferred that amount to the lender. He says 
Lending Stream then issued a default notice for sums due in March,  April and May 2018. 
The default  notice  said Mr S owed £210.64,  but Mr S says that, based  on the figures 
provided by Lending Stream, the additional  amount owed should  be £89.64. He wants 
Lending Stream to accept that amount to settle  the loan.
Lending Stream explained  that the interest  had been  calculated  in accordance with the 
original loan schedule,  but it also offered to set up an affordable repayment plan for the 
balance.
Following the involvement of this service, however, Lending Stream  subsequently offered  to 
close Mr Ss account with no further payments  due.
Mr S responded to say he wanted  the case referred to the Financial Conduct Authority as, in 
his view, charging interest in advance is illegal.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He explained  the 
reasons for the difference in the interest  calculations and found Lending Streams offer to be 
fair and reasonable.
Mr S wanted  his complaint reviewed.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It is clear to me that Mr S acted in good faith when he paid what he calculated to be the 
settlement balance on 7 February 2018.
However, according to the Pre-Contract Credit Information Interest is calculated  and applied 
to the capital balance outstanding at the beginning of each payment cycle. It goes on to say 
that If you repay your loan early and in full during a cycle, you will incur interest for the 
entirety of the cycle  during which you make  early repayment, but you will not be charged 
interest for what would  have been  the remainder of the loan term. This is entirely consistent 
with the Consumer Credit  (Early Settlement) Regulations 2004  as cited  in the loan 
agreement.
Im satisfied that Lending Stream is entitled to calculate the interest due in that way.
To calculate what Mr S should have repaid on 7 February 2018, I have used the following 
repayment schedule  as outlined in the loan agreement:
Ref: DRN15646092Payment DatesRepayment  Amount  
(Principal + Interest)Principal Interest
22-Dec-2017 £115.20 £0.00 £115.20
24-Jan-2018 £185.60 £80.00 £105.60
23-Feb-2018 £156.80 £80.00 £76.80
23-Mar-2018 £133.76 £80.00 £53.76
24-Apr-2018 £120.96 £80.00 £40.96
24-May-2018 £87.68 £80.00 £7.68
Based on the above, Mr S needed to repay the entirety of December, January and February 
repayments, plus the remaining principal balance from March, April and May. In total that 
comes to £697.60. At that point  Mr S had paid £575.96, so he owed a further  £121.64.
I accept Lending  Stream was saying his outstanding balance was £210.64, but that included 
further interest charges from February 2018  as Mr S didnt clear his balance  at the time.
That said,  I find Mr S emailed Lending Stream the same day he made  his final payment and 
explained he was clearing his outstanding balance. Although Lending Stream responded, it 
referred to a previous payment and did not explain  to Mr S about the shortfall. Mr S did not 
hear from Lending Stream again  until 23 March  2018 when he missed his next payment.
So, although  I dont  dispute the calculations Lending  Stream  has used to work out Mr Ss 
current outstanding  balance, I consider a fair outcome would be to reduce the balance  to the 
additional £121.64 Mr S was liable  for in February 2018. I say that because:
Im satisfied  Mr S intended  to clear his balance at that point;
Lending Stream did not explain the situation  to Mr S at the time he paid the 
settlement, despite him sending an email to that effect;
By the time Mr S became aware  that there was still an outstanding balance  on his 
account he already  owed  more  interest.
Nevertheless, I acknowledge Lending Stream has already offered to close Mr Ss account 
with no further  payments.  Based on the above,  I find that to be a fair and reasonable offer.
my final decision
My decision  is that Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) should  write off the balance 
of Mr Ss loan and close his account, as it has offered to do.
 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 March  2020.
