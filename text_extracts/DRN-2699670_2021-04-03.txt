The complaint
Mr G complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his account without 
notice or reason.
What happened
Mr G says he held a NatWest account for about 25 years but received a letter in April 2020 
telling him his account was closed. He says he also received a cheque for the account 
balance of over Â£800. Mr G says he had no prior warning of the closure and would like 
NatWest to tell him the reasons why it closed the account and to apologise, as well as open 
a new account.
NatWest says it wrote to Mr Gs home address in Pakistan in January 2020 telling him it 
would be closing his account in 60 days in line with account terms and conditions. It says its 
entitled to do so and doesnt have to provide reasons. It also says it isnt responsible for the 
safe delivery of the mail.
Mr G brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought NatWest was entitled to close an account without giving reasons by giving 60 days 
notice. And couldnt hold NatWest responsible for the safe delivery of the mail.
Mr G doesnt accept that view and in summary says the account was a contract and 
NatWest should not close an account without a reason. He also says its our role to protect 
his rights and NatWest should review its policy about account closure. Mr G says NatWest 
has failed to provide evidence that it posted the letter to him in January 2020 giving him the 
60 days notice.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr G will be disappointed by my decision.
I make clear to Mr G that we are not NatWests regulator and so its not our role to decide 
what its policy should be on the closure of accounts and we cant tell it that it should review 
that policy. Im satisfied that its up to NatWest to decide what its policy is on these matters 
when it exercises its commercial judgement and its not something, I can fairly interfere in. I 
also make clear to Mr G that our role is not to protect his rights as he suggests, but to look at 
a complaint independently and make a fair and reasonable decision.
I have looked at NatWests account terms and conditions which I think Mr G would have 
agreed to when the account was opened. Those terms and conditions say that NatWest can 
close a customers account without providing reasons by giving 60 days notice. Im satisfied 
that on balance that notice was given to Mr G in a letter that was sent to his home address in 
Pakistan. So, Im satisfied that NatWest has acted fairly and hasnt made a mistake by 
deciding it no longer wished to have a business relationship with Mr G and that it gave him 
appropriate notice. Im satisfied that NatWest is not obliged to provide reasons for that 
decision.
I appreciate Mr G says he didnt receive the closure notice letter that NatWest says was sent 
in January 2020. I think it likely on balance it was sent, and I dont think NatWest can 
reasonably provide postage evidence as Mr G suggests. I cant fairly hold NatWest 
responsible for the safe delivery of mail as it is not involved in that. I also appreciate Mr G 
suggests that NatWest has breached the contract between them, but Im satisfied that it 
would be for a court to decide that issue.
Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest was entitled to close Mr Gs account and that it gave him 
appropriate notice. And that this decision brings an end to what we can do to resolve this 
complaint informally.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2021.
