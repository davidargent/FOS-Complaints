The complaint
Mr A complains PrePay Technologies Limited unfairly held onto his funds and unfairly closed 
his account. He wants the money returned and compensation for the impact this had on him.
What happened
Mr A held an account with a company for whom PrePay is responsible as principal. In 
November 2021 they blocked his account while they carried out a review. They then decided 
to close his account in December 2021 and retain the funds he held. They say they 
eventually returned the balance in his account to source.
Mr A says he didnt do anything wrong and not being able to access his funds has caused 
him a great deal of distress and inconvenience.  He thinks the issue might relate to funds 
being paid into his account which resulted from him selling cryptocurrency but PrePay hasnt 
confirmed what prompted their actions. Mr A says he regularly buys and sells cryptocurrency 
on a platform, so many of the payments into and out of his account represented those 
transactions. 
In February 2022 PrePay accidentally told Mr A his account had reactivated, but this wasnt 
correct. He says they also sent him commercial material during this period despite his 
account being closed and them holding onto funds. He says he is struggling financially, and 
these events caused him further distress and difficulty.
Our investigator decided to uphold the complaint. They concluded:
- PrePay could block his account to carry out a review. This was in line with their legal 
and regulatory responsibilities. It was understandable why they took this action and 
they werent obliged to provide Mr A with their reasons.
- Mr A says his balance before PrePay blocked his account was around £1555. 
PrePay however hasnt provided copies of his statements, despite them being 
requested.
- PrePay hadnt provided a sufficient basis to show it was fair for them to return the 
funds they held back to source.
- PrePay caused Mr A further distress by accidentally telling him his account had been 
reactivated when it hadnt been. They also sent promotional material to him for a 
period despite his account being closed and holding onto his funds.
- PrePay should refund the sum which represented Mr As balance at the time the 
account was blocked and add 8% simple interest on that sum from 2 December 2021 
until the date of settlement. They should also pay him £500 for the upset and 
inconvenience he was caused.
PrePay asked for a final decision from an ombudsman, so the complaint has been given to 
me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have decided to uphold Mr As complaint. Ill explain why.
I understand the reason for PrePay reviewing and restricting Mr As account. Its clear to me 
that they were acting in line with their legal and regulatory responsibilities. And, while I 
understand Mr A would want to know what prompted PrePays actions, they were under no 
obligation to reveal them  and their reason for not revealing them is legitimate.
Based on the information I have; I cant fairly conclude PrePay took sufficient steps to 
reasonably conclude Mr A wasnt entitled to the funds in his account. I dont find the reason 
PrePay provided was by itself sufficient in the individual circumstances of Mr As complaint - 
it doesnt demonstrate their decision was reasonable.
PrePay could terminate its relationship with Mr A, but they needed to apply the correct 
account terms and conditions. PrePay closed Mr As account with immediate effect, and only 
certain circumstances allow them to do this. I have considered the basis for PrePay relying 
on the term in question, but I dont find they had sufficient information to reasonably 
conclude those circumstances applied. So, I find Mr A ought to have been given the normal 
notice period for his account to close.
PrePay acknowledge they made a mistake when they sent a notification to Mr A that his 
account had reactivated. Given what Mr A has said about his financial circumstances and 
the distress not having hold of the funds had on him, I find this caused him further distress 
when finding out the situation remained the same. It was also insensitive to send commercial 
material to him given his account had closed and they were holding his funds.
Putting things right
PrePay need to refund Mr A an amount which is the same as the balance they held for him 
at the time they blocked his account. They also need to pay 8% simple interest per annum 
on this sum from 2 December 2021 to the date of settlement. I find this date represents a 
reasonable endpoint by which PrePay ought to have completed their review and released 
the funds to Mr A.
PrePay has failed to provide statements for Mr As account despite them being requested, 
so its not possible for me to know for certain what Mr As balance was when his account 
was blocked. But based on what Mr A recollects his balance to be, I dont find the sum 
PrePay held was insubstantial. So, not being able to use those funds to help his situation 
would have had some impact on how he felt.
Mr A has explained he experienced a lot of distress by not being able to access his funds. In 
particular he revealed how his mental health was impacted. I was sorry to hear what Mr A 
said. And, I have seen no reason to question that he has been through a difficult time which 
was worsened by not having use of his funds for a considerable period. 
With this is mind I find PrePay should also pay Mr A £500 compensation for the distress he 
was caused by PrePay not giving him his funds over a prolonged period, for his account 
being closed immediately, for being incorrectly told his account was reactivated, and for 
being sent material when his account was closed and his funds were held. Cumulatively I 
find this likely caused him considerable distress and £500 represents a proportionate sum to 
make up for it.
My final decision
Ive decided to uphold Mr As complaint. I direct PrePay Technologies Limited to pay 
compensation to Mr A according to my direction above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or reject my decision before 10 November 2022.
