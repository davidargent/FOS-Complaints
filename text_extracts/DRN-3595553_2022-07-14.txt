The complaint
Mrs M complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (NewDay) lent irresponsibly when they 
approved her credit card application and then increased her credit limit on two occasions.
Mrs M is represented by a claims management company (the CMC).  
What happened
In January 2018, Mrs M applied to NewDay for a credit card. Her application was completed 
through an online comparison site. Mrs Ms application was assessed by NewDay and they 
agreed to provide a credit card account with an initial limit of £300.
In May 2018, NewDay increased the limit on Mrs Ms credit card account to £1,200. 
Similarly, in January 2019, NewDay increased Mrs Ms credit card account limit again to 
£1,950.
In June 2021, the CMC wrote to NewDay on behalf of Mrs M. They said Mrs M was 
struggling financially at the time the original application was approved. Mrs Ms credit history 
was very poor, and shed subsequently missed or was late with payments. The CMC said 
Mrs M was struggling to pay the credit card along with other financial commitments.
The CMC said Mrs M was earning £1,200 a month with monthly expenses of £1,000, so had 
limited disposable income. They also said Mrs M had stated she wasnt always able to make 
payments and it shouldve been clear she was struggling financially. Mrs M had said that she 
had to borrow to keep up with payments. 
The CMC said NewDay hadnt completed proper checks which wouldve shown that the 
credit card account wasnt affordable for Mrs M. They thought NewDay should have 
completed a review of Mrs Ms income and expenditure before agreeing to lend. The CMC 
said Mrs M was often only paying the minimum required payments and there were instances 
where she was charged overlimit fees because she was continuously in excess of the credit 
limit. They thought this shouldve prompted further checks.
They asked NewDay to:
refund all interest and charges; and
pay 8% statutory interest; and
remove any adverse marks from Mrs Ms credit file.
NewDay responded to the CMC and didnt agree theyd acted irresponsibly when they 
agreed to lend to Mrs M. They said theyd used the information provided by Mrs M in her 
application together with information obtained from the credit reference agencies and 
bureau. NewDay didnt agree theyd been any cause to undertake further checks and 
assessments. 
NewDay also said that theyd reviewed Mrs Ms account together with other reported credit 
before offering to increase her limit. They gave Mrs M 40 days-notice so she could opt out of 
any limit increase. NewDay found no reason not to provide the limits they did.
The CMC didnt agree with NewDays findings. So, they referred Mrs Ms complaint to this 
service.
Having considered all the information and evidence provided, our investigator thought 
NewDays decision to initially provide a credit card with a £300 limit was reasonable. But our 
investigator thought NewDay had failed to complete further reasonable and proportionate 
checks when they increased Mrs Ms credit limit. And that those checks would have 
demonstrated that the limit increases were unaffordable.
Our investigator thought NewDay should refund any interest and charges they applied 
relating to anything above the original limit and adjust the balance owed to what it wouldve 
been had the limit not been increased. They also thought NewDay should pay interest at 8% 
simple on any amount overpaid and due back to Mrs M.
NewDay didnt agree with our investigators findings. They said theyd acted fairly, and 
appropriate checks had been completed. NewDay said there was no indication of financial 
difficulty.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Mrs Ms complaint has been passed to me to 
consider.
I reached a different outcome to that of our investigator. Because of that, I issued a 
provisional decision on 16 June 2022  giving both Mrs M and NewDay the opportunity to 
respond to my findings below before I reached a final decision.
In my provisional decision, I said:
The rules and guidance relevant at the time NewDay provided Mrs M with a credit 
card were set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC). These required NewDay to carry out an assessment using 
reasonable and proportionate checks to determine whether Mrs M could afford to 
repay the credit card in a sustainable way. Those checks needed to be borrower 
focussed and consider whether making the repayments could result in financial 
difficulties for Mrs M.
This service believes that any checks needed to consider Mrs Ms personal 
circumstances and would usually need to be more thorough:
the lower a consumers income; and
the higher the amount due to be repaid; and
the longer the term of the debt; and
the greater the number and frequency of debts.
Conversely, a less detailed affordability assessment, without the need for verification, 
is far more likely to be fair, reasonable, and proportionate where the amount to be 
repaid is relatively small, the financial situation is stable, and the debt is for a 
relatively short period.
Ive been provided with the information used to assess Mrs Ms original credit card 
application. Mrs M stated her annual income as £120,000. She said she worked part 
time as a contractor and lived in rented accommodation. Data obtained from the 
credit bureau showed she had four active credit accounts with unsecured debt 
outstanding of £400. There was a record of three defaults. But the last of these was 
40 months old. NewDay said that this is within their policy to lend. The data also 
showed that Mrs M had no other public records, no payday loans and none of her 
existing accounts were in arrears.
Given the information above and the level of credit offered relative to Mrs Ms 
income, at the time, I dont believe it was necessary for NewDay to complete further 
checks and tests in assessing Mrs Ms application. The credit offered equated to only 
0.25% of her stated income and her total existing borrowings totalled 0.33% of that 
income. So, Im persuaded that NewDays decision to lend to Mrs M was reasonable.NewDay later offered to increase Mrs Ms credit limit to £1,200. She was given an 
option to opt out of this but didnt do so. Bureau information showed no adverse 
information reported and no pay day loans. In the two months prior to her limit being 
increased, Mrs M did exceed her credit limit twice by a maximum of £14.35. But 
relative to her stated income, I think this was a small amount and notice it was 
promptly adjusted each month. 
Given all the information held and Mrs Ms stated income, I dont think this wouldve 
prompted NewDay to complete further checks and tests. Rather, it could well have 
been a sign that Mrs Ms initial limit wasnt sufficient for her needs. So, I dont think 
NewDays decision to offer a limit increase was unreasonable.
Towards the end of 2018, NewDay completed a review of Mrs Ms account for a 
second time. During the period since her limit was first increased, Mrs M had only 
exceeded the limit on two occasions. Again, this was promptly adjusted, and she was 
often paying more than the required minimum payment each month. There was no 
adverse data reported on her credit file and although her debt levels had increased 
elsewhere, this was proportionately low relative to her stated income.
Having considered the information available to NewDay, I dont believe there was 
anything that wouldve prompted them to complete further checks and tests. The 
proposed limit increase to £1,950 equated to just 1.6% of Mrs Ms stated income. 
And accepting that her overall indebtedness had increased, this amounted to a little 
more than 9% of her stated income. So, I dont think NewDays decision to offer a 
further limit increase was unreasonable here.
The CMC have provided a copy of Mrs Ms credit file dated September 2021. Having 
reviewed this, a large proportion of the reported debts and accounts post-date any of 
NewDays lending decisions. So, these wouldnt have influenced NewDays 
assessments. Of the reported accounts that did pre-date NewDays decisions, there 
is no evidence of financial difficulty, missed payments or arrears.
The CMC have asked NewDay to remove all adverse data reported on Mrs Ms credit 
file. But having reviewed what the CMC have provided, I cant see that NewDay have 
recorded anything adverse. In fact, Mrs Ms account has been maintained within the 
contractual terms throughout.
Ive also seen Mrs Ms written summary of her complaint. But this appears to raise 
different issues to that raised by the CMC. And as these werent included within the 
original complaint, NewDay havent had the opportunity to consider them. So, Im 
unable to consider those points at this time.
Given all of the above, while I appreciate that Mrs M may be disappointed, Im not 
persuaded that theres any reason for me to uphold her complaint. So, I dont intend 
to ask NewDay to do anything more.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision, I asked both parties to respond with any new information or 
comments they wanted me to consider. 
Despite follow up requests from this service, neither NewDay, Mrs M or the CMC responded 
to my provisional decision. And as Ive not been provided with any additional comments or 
information, Ive found no reason to vary from my original findings. So, my final decision 
remains the same.My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2022.
