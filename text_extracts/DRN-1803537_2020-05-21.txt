The complaint
Ms R complains that Capital One (Europe) plc wont refund to her the money that she paid 
for some flights. She also complains about the service that she's received from the booking 
company.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
In certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the 
supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier. To be able to uphold Ms Rs complaint about Capital One, 
I must be satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
booking company and that Capital One's response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair 
or reasonable. Im not determining the outcome of Ms Rs claim under section 75 as only a 
court would be able to do that.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
it's clear that Ms R wanted to buy tickets online for some flights from an airline and 
that she thought that she was using the airline's website;
I understand that the search engine took her to the website of a booking 
company and not the airline's website;
Ms R selected the flights that she wanted, entered her details and paid for the flights 
- but some time later she noticed that her payment had been made to the booking 
company and not the airline;
she complained to Capital One that she'd been the victim of a fraud and it made a 
chargeback claim for the money that she'd paid - but the booking company said that 
it had booked Ms R's flights with the airline and that a link to the online check-in 
would be sent to her before the flights - so Capital One said that it wasn't able to 
accept that the transactions were fraudulent but it credited Ms R's account with £35 
as a goodwill gesture;
Ms R says that she didn't receive any paperwork or travel documents for the flights, 
that she needed to change the flights because of a family bereavement and that 
she's not been treated fairly by the booking company when trying to change them;
the booking company says that the booking confirmation, flight details and electronic 
tickets were sent to the e-mail address that Ms R had provided;
I sympathise with Ms R for the family bereavement and the financial and medical 
difficulties that she's described - but she booked the flights on the booking company's 
website and I've seen no evidence to show that the flights weren't available for her to 
use;I don't consider that the booking company has acted fraudulently and I'm not 
persuaded that there'd enough evidence to show that there's been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the booking company;
Ms R complains about the way that she's been dealt with by the booking company - 
but I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that those issues are 
enough to be a breach of contract by the booking company and Capital One 
isn't liable under section 75 for any issues with the service that she received from the 
booking company;
Capital One made a chargeback claim which was defended by the booking company, 
it said that it had considered other options for claiming a refund but had found that it 
didn't have any rights to do so and it credited her account with £35 as a gesture of 
goodwill;
I consider that Capital One's response to Ms R's claim for a refund has been fair and 
reasonable; and
I find that it wouldn't be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Capital One to refund to Ms R the money that she paid for the flights, to pay her any 
further compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I don't uphold Ms R's complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms R to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 June 2020.
