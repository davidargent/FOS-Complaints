Complaint
Mr S complains that an international transfer  he paid Thilina Sri Lanka UK Ltd (TSL) to 
undertake has not reached its destination and hasnt been refunded  either.
Background
What Mr S says
TSL is a money transfer business, Mr S says that on 17 September 2018 he transferred the 
equivalent of £65,297 to TSL in foreign currency, which TSL was to return to him in pounds 
sterling within two weeks.  On 8 October  2018 Mr S received £15,297  from TSL,  leaving a 
balance of £50,000. Mr S then received  a further  £30,000 on 22 October 2018.
Mr S says that TSL asked  him to pay further sums so that it could clear funds from another 
client and return the outstanding amount of £20,000 plus the additional amount requested. Mr 
S was transferring  funds as he was buying a house  and needed  to have a deposit to
apply for a mortgage. He says he didnt want to lose the house, so on 23 October  2018  he 
paid TSL a further  £15,000 in sterling and the equivalent of around £9,500 in foreign currency.  
The £15,000  was to be returned the same day together with the outstanding
£20,000. The amount paid in foreign  currency  was to be returned after a month  with a 3% 
interest rate.
Mr S received £20,000 from TSL on 23 October  and £4,000  on 30 October 2018. Mr S didnt 
receive any further funds  from TSL.
On 11 December 2018 Mr S received an email from TSL It said that for the past few months 
TSL had been facing some  serious  financial difficulties as a financial company had illegally 
retained its clients funds. The email went on to say it owed Mr S £23,000, it had taken  all
required legal actions  and would update  him as soon as it heard from legal authorities. Mr S 
didnt hear anything more from TSL,  so he raised  a complaint with this service.
Our investigation so far
Our investigator got in contact with TSL to let it know Mr S had sought our help to make a 
complaint and asked  it to issue  its final response. She asked it to provide its version  of events 
but, despite repeated requests TSL, didnt respond.
In the absence of any information  from TSL, our investigator said there was evidence  to show  
Mr S paid TSL around £65,000 in foreign currency on 17 September  2018 and his UK bank 
statements showed he received £45,000  from TSL Whilst there was no evidence of the second 
agreement and the interest  rate agreed,  the investigator noted there was evidence of transfers 
to TSL of at least £15,000 on 23 October  2018.  Given that all the other evidence matched Mr 
Ss testimony, and TSL sent Mr S an email and text message saying it owed
him £23,000, the investigator was persuaded Mr S paid a further £25,000 to TSL.
After deducting  the amount Mr S had received from TSL from the total amount he paid, the 
investigator found there was a shortfall  of £21,000. After adding  interest  she thought  the 
outstanding figure was likely to be the £23,000 Mr S says he is owed to him and TSL agreed
it owed. She concluded therefore that TSL should refund Mr S £23,000 and pay him interest 
on this amount. She said it should  also pay Mr S an additional £150 for the trouble and upset 
caused when  Mr S was worried about his mortgage application.
Mr S agreed with the investigators findings.  This services attempt to send the investigators 
opinion to TSLs  registered office or to the email address registered on the Financial Conduct  
Authoritys (FCA) register were unsuccessful and so no official  response was received from 
TSL. But an individual  purporting  to be a director of TSL sent a reply from a private  email  
address. It said he agreed with the investigators  findings and wished to pay Mr S what the 
investigator had recommended but was experiencing financial difficulties and needed  time to 
establish the business again. The individual didnt provide a file but referred me to its email  
exchange with the special  fraud unit concerning the third party  TSL say has retained  client 
funds resulting in its inability  to pay Mr S what it owes.
In the circumstances, the complaint was passed  to me so that if I upheld it Mr S can try to 
enforce the decision through  the courts. I issued my provisional decision on 27 November 
2020 and said:
Ref: DRN5374183This service hasnt received any communication from TSL via the correspondence channels  
listed on the regulators website. The only contact  we have had has been  from an alleged  
individual director who has communicated solely from a private yahoo email address that
could have been created  by anyone. In the circumstances I dont think I can fairly accept that 
this correspondence  has come from TSL direct. So Ive based  my provisional  decision on fairly 
limited and incomplete evidence provided by Mr S, which Ive set out below:
-TSL money transfer confirmation dated  2 October 2018  showing a payment equivalent to 
£65,297 to TSL;
-Mr Ss UK bank statements showing he received £15,297  on 8 October 2018 and £30,000 
on 22 October 2018;
-Evidence Mr S transferred £8,000 and £7,000  to TSL on 23 October 2018;
-Text messages between Mr S and TSL in which Mr S agreed  to pay a certain sum in 
foreign currency to TSL on the basis that sum plus 3% interest would  be returned to him 
after a month;
-Confirmation that Mr S paid the agreed  sum in foreign currency to TSL on 23 October 
2018;
-Mr Ss UK bank statements showing he received £20,000  on 23 October 2018 and £4,000 
on 30 October 2018 from TSL;
-A text message from TSL saying £23,000  was outstanding;
-An email from TSL dated 11 December 2018 referring to its own financial difficulties and 
an outstanding  amount of £23,000.
Mr S has provided evidence of the initial agreement he reached with TSL in September 2018  
and set out in the money transfer confirmation dated 2 October 2018. He has also 
demonstrated receipt of £15,297 (8 October  2018) and £30,000 (23 October  2018) in to his
UK bank  account.  So, at the time Mr S says he agreed to pay further sums TSL owed him
£20,000.
I havent been provided with evidence of the subsequent agreement Mr S says he made with 
TSL to transfer further funds to TSL in sterling and foreign currency  on 23 October 2018. The 
only evidence that is likely  to relate  to the transfer  of foreign currency  part of the
agreement is a series of undated  text messages in which Mr S agreed  to pay a certain sum in 
foreign currency on the basis  TSL would return that sum together with interest at the rate of 
3% after a month. Mr S has evidence he transferred that same sum to TSL on 23 October 
2018. Based  on the exchange  rate used in Mr Ss first transaction when he expected  to
receive £65,297, Mr S transferred the equivalent of £9,132.42 on 23 October 2018.
Mr S tells me all other terms were agreed in telephone calls,  so he doesnt have any further 
evidence.
TSL later sent Mr S a text message and an email dated 11 December  2018  acknowledging it 
owed him £23,000.  TSL didnt provide a breakdown of this figure and I cant see how it was 
arrived at. The evidence  indicates that around £20,132 was owed to Mr S, although I ve not 
seen his statements  from his account abroad to establish if any sums were  paid to another 
account. Ive arrived  at this sum by simply deducting what Mr S received  in his UK account 
from TSL from the amount he paid.
Mr S told me the figure of £23,000 takes into account interest  and exchange rate differences,  
but I havent seen any evidence in support. Interest wasnt discussed in the original agreement 
and Mr S has said that as TSL was due to return the additional £15,000 he paid
on 23 October 2018 on the same day no interest  was agreed.  The only evidence  of an 
agreement in respect of interest was a 3% rate for a month when Mr S transferred foreign 
currency. So, although Mr S has referred to an interest rate of 12 to 13% being normal  in the
country he was transferring funds from, I cant see any agreement was reached about this 
rate. Im also having  difficulty  in understanding why TSL would hold Mr Ss money or pay 
interest on it given it is registered  with the FCA as a payment institution  involved in money
remittance. TSL isnt an authorised  investment  firm.
Overall, I recognise TSL has sent Mr S an email from its registered email address saying it 
owes him £23,000 but dont have enough evidence  to direct TSL to pay this sum.  The email  
from TSLs registered  address  doesnt give any indication of how this sum has been
Ref: DRN5374183calculated and other evidence doesnt  justify the figure.  Also, as Ive already said,  the only 
contact this service has had with TSL has been  from a private email address so cant  fairly be 
relied on.
Following the investigators opinion an email  said to be from a director of TSL from a private 
email address referred to communication with the special fraud unit. Whilst the emails 
demonstrate some issues TSL has faced,  and the reason for its difficult financial position,
they dont help in resolving Mr Ss individual complaint.
TSL didnt respond to my provisional decision. Mr S spoke to the investigator and gave his 
reasons for rejecting  my provisional decision as follows:
-TSL admitted liability from its official email address rather  than in an email  from an 
individual director.
-He has UK bank statements from another account which  shows  he didnt receive 
further credits from TSL. 
-He was trying to get his bank statements from abroad but was facing difficulties as the 
bank would only send  them to an address in that country.
-He has provided  all the evidence he has and cant get anything more from TSL.
He would like his money back.
My findings  
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And having  done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as I did in my provisional  decision  and for the same reasons.
Ref: DRN5374183K820x#14This service has had no contact from any of the correspondence channels  listed on the FCA 
website for TSL. I cant fairly accept the response from a personal  email address as the 
response of TSL. 
I note Mr S has tried to get bank statements from abroad and not been  successful, and that 
hes referred to statements from another UK account. Without  other evidence  particularly 
in relation to the terms of the second agreement Mr S says he reached with TSL  these 
statements wouldnt be sufficient for me to uphold this complaint. 
I accept that TSL emailed  Mr S from its registered email address saying it owes him 
£23,000, but I dont consider this to be enough  for me to issue  a legally binding decision 
requiring it to pay this sum. There is insufficient evidence  of why the amount is owed and no 
evidence of how the figure was calculated. The evidence Mr S has provided doesnt justify  a 
debt of £23,000 either. In the circumstances,  whilst  I understand Mr Ss disappointment, I 
cant fairly require TSL to pay Mr S £23,000.
My final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 February  2021.
