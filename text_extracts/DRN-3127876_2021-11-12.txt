The complaint
Miss R complains that shes unable to transfer funds from her account with National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) to a third-party bank.
What happened
Miss R holds a Help to Buy ISA with NatWest. She wanted to transfer money from the ISA to 
an account she holds with another bank. NatWest declined her request, saying that the 
terms and conditions of the ISA dont allow her to do this. It said that she would need to open 
a current account with NatWest first and then transfer funds from the ISA into that in order to 
make a withdrawal. But Miss R says she should be able to transfer the money to an external 
account. She says shes done so before.
Our Investigator didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly here. But Miss R didnt agree and 
asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman. Miss R has referred to NatWests 
Key Features document which contains information about the Help to Buy ISA. She says its 
not clear from this that she can only withdraw money from the ISA by putting it into another 
NatWest account. She says that the document is misleading.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Key Features document which Miss R has referred to says Can I make withdrawals 
from a Help to Buy: ISA? Yes  the NatWest Help to Buy: ISA is instant access and you may 
withdraw funds if you wish to. I dont find this to be misleading or incorrect, as it is possible 
to withdraw funds from the ISA.
The Key Features document doesnt set out the details of how withdrawals work. But I 
wouldnt expect it to do that. Its intended as an overview of the account features. The full 
details of the way the account works are set out in the terms and conditions, which Miss R 
agreed to be bound by when opening and continuing to use the account.
The terms and conditions say that Miss R can transfer money from the ISA to another 
account held in her name with NatWest. If she wants to make a withdrawal, she needs to 
transfer the money into a NatWest current account (or another type of NatWest account 
described in the terms and conditions as a Payment Account) first. The terms say that, if 
Miss R has a Payment Account, she can transfer money from it to any other account based 
in the UK. 
So, Miss R can withdraw funds from the ISA. But she cant transfer money directly from the 
ISA to a third-party bank. If she wants to do that, she needs to move it to another NatWest 
account first. Thats in line with what NatWest has told Miss R. So I dont think it made a 
mistake when it told her she couldnt transfer the funds directly to her other bank account.
But Miss R says she transferred money directly from the ISA to an account with another 
bank in September 2020. She says she doesnt understand why NatWest wont let her do 
this again as nothing has changed since the last time. NatWest hasnt been able to confirm 
the reason why Miss R was previously able to transfer funds to an external account.  But 
Miss R says that she spent more than five hours on the phone to NatWest at the time and 
that it only agreed to the transfer after she spoke to a senior manager. She says that tens of 
people had told her beforehand that she couldnt do it.
Theres no further evidence on this point for me to consider. But, in light of what Ive said 
above and the wider surrounding circumstances here, I think its most likely that NatWest 
allowed the transfer to take place in September 2020, despite it being contrary to the terms 
and conditions, in response to the extensive contact from Miss R about the issue and in 
order to try and resolve her dissatisfaction at the time. I dont find that NatWest is obliged to 
allow another transfer, simply because it allowed one previously.
Miss R says that, because she cant transfer money to an external account, she isnt able to 
use the money she has in the ISA. I understand that she would like to be able to transfer 
money directly to a non-NatWest account online or by phone. But I dont think NatWest 
acted unfairly by saying this isnt possible. Thats because Miss R is able to access her 
funds in other ways and NatWest has told Miss R what she needs to do to withdraw the 
money. It confirmed in its final response letter that, in order to transfer funds from the ISA, 
Miss R will need to open a current account with NatWest. She can then transfer funds from 
the ISA to the current account, in line with the terms and conditions. Alternatively, NatWest 
said that Miss R can visit a NatWest branch to arrange a CHAPS transfer. I think thats 
reasonable.
I realise Miss R feels strongly about her complaint and Im sorry to disappoint her. But I dont 
think NatWest has acted unfairly here. So Im not going to ask it to do anything.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 December 2021.
