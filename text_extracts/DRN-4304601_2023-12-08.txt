The complaint
Mr M complains that he was charged a late payment fee by PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA (PayPal); and his credit file was marked.
What happened
Mr M has a credit account with PayPal. His limit was £2,250. On his statement dated 25 
December 2022, he was charged a late payment fee of £12 and his credit file was marked 
with a late payment note.
The transactions on his PayPal account were:
Statement date Balance Minimum payment due 
date / AmountCredits received to 
PayPal account/ date
25 October 2022 £1,385.32 19 November 2022 - £45.27 £47.80 - 1 October 2022
25 November 2022 £1,361.89 20 December 2022 - £45.21 £45.27 - 30 October 2022
£50 - 25 November 2022
25 December 2022 £1,332.61 19 January 2023 - £109.43 None  late payment fee 
£12
25 January 2023 £1,699.26 19 February 2023 - £54.72 £109.43 - 13 January 
2023
Mr M complained. He said he paid the minimum amount due for December 2022 early. He 
paid £50 on 25 November 2022  and therefore he had not missed the December 2022 
payment. He said the late payment fee was unfair, as was the late payment marker added to 
his credit file. He also said he was told by PayPal he had two late payment marks on his 
credit file  but this couldnt be correct. 
Mr M argued that PayPals terms and conditions do not say he had to make the minimum 
payment within the statement cycle, but just that it must be paid by the due date  which was 
by 20 December 2022. And  he had done that as hed paid in the minimum on 25 
November 2022. He said PayPal had breached the contract. He told us the late payment fee 
had been refunded by PayPal, but he wants the late payment marker removed from his 
credit file, and compensation for the trouble and time taken by what happened. 
PayPal said Mr M didnt make the necessary payment to his account by 20 December 2022, 
and was therefore charged a late payment fee, and his credit file was marked. Mr Ms 
statement for December 2022 showed no payment was received in that period.
Mr M brought his complaint to us. Our investigator didnt uphold it. She said PayPals terms 
and conditions required him to make the minimum payment by the due date shown on the 
statement, and it also said that any missed payments would be reflected on his credit file. 
PayPal said the credit of £50 was paid during the November 2022 statement period, and not 
in December 2022  this was PayPals process. There wasnt a payment made in the 
December 2022 period.
She noted that PayPal had sent Mr M a payment reminder on 15 December 2022  to his 
email address. This said the payment was due soon, but Mr M hadnt contacted PayPal at 
that time.
Mr M asked that an ombudsman looks at his complaint. He said again that PayPals terms 
and conditions dont cover the circumstances of what happened. So  his complaint has 
come to me to look at and make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of Mr Ms complaint is (in summary) that PayPals terms and conditions dont say 
that the minimum payment must be paid within the statement period  i.e. in this case, after 
25 November 2022 but before 20 December 2022. He argues that the terms and conditions 
simply say (in summary) that the minimum payment must be paid by 20 December 2022  
and he says the £50 credit (25 November 2022) was that payment.
So, I looked at PayPals terms and conditions. They say: We will make monthly Credit
Account statements available online at paypal.co.uk and will send you an email
reminder when a statement becomes available. Each statement shows all
amounts added to the Credit Account or paid to us in the period covered by the
statement, the minimum monthly payment and the due date for payment.
 Payment Due Date means the payment due date shown on your statement. This date 
will be at least 25 days after the statement date.
Each month you must pay at least the minimum monthly payment on or before the date 
shown on your statement. This date will be at least 25 days after your statement date, unless 
we tell you otherwise.
Ive then considered what these say in the context of Mr Ms complaint. I think the important 
clause here is Each statement shows all amounts added to the Credit Account or paid to us 
in the period covered by the statement. In Mr Ms case, the credit of £50 was shown on 
his November 2022 statement (it was credited on 25 November 2022) - i.e. it counted 
towards payments in November 2022  and couldnt be considered a payment due the 
following month.
There is a practical point to consider here  Mr M couldve simply decided to pay in a further 
credit (of £50) in November 2022  to reduce his balance and the interest he was paying. 
That wouldve been an understandable thing to do, and of course a lot of customers pay in 
extra amounts of money over and above the minimum due for that reason. I dont think its 
reasonable to expect PayPal to distinguish between those overpayments and contractual 
minimum payments. 
Moreover, I also noted that PayPal emailed Mr M on 15 December 2022 to advise him the 
December 2022 payment was due and hadnt been paid. The advice said A payment for 
your PayPal Credit account is due on 20 December 2022 It went on to describe ways to pay. So - PayPal did advise Mr M that he still needed to make the payment due in December 
2022. And therefore, its reasonable to have expected him to realise that the payment made 
on 25 November 2022 wasnt considered to be the payment due by 20 December 2022.
Mr M told us that PayPal refunded the late payment fee in any case. Turning to the mark on 
Mr Ms credit file, PayPal are obliged to report accurate information to the credit reference 
agencies  they can only change that if there is an error. And in this case, I dont consider 
PayPal have made an error or acted unreasonably.  Mr M has said he has two late payment 
marks on his credit file, but PayPal told us that one relates to a missed payment in May 2019 
 which isnt part of the complaint Mr M brought to us.
Going forward, it would seem sensible for Mr M to set up a direct debit for PayPal to take the 
minimum payments and in line with the statements issued  then there wont be any further, 
similar issues.
Mr M has argued passionately and in detail in support of his complaint, which I appreciate. 
He will therefore be disappointed by my decision, which is that PayPal dont have to do 
anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2024.
