The complaint
Mrs M complains that National Savings and Investments (NSI) made an error when opening 
investment accounts.
What happened
In July 2021, Mrs M called NSI to invest £50,000. This was placed into a direct saver 
account. In May 2022, £30,000 was transferred into PSBs and the remainder transferred 
away from NSI.
Mrs M complained that she wanted to open PSBs with the investment of £50,000  not into a 
direct saver. She said this was important to her as it was all the investment money she had 
left after a split from her ex-partner. She said she wouldve won much more than the offered 
compensation from NSI if the investment into PSBs had been made as she intended.
NSI discussed Mrs Ms complaint with her and agreed to pay compensation of £150. Mrs M 
didnt, on reflection accept this outcome and brought her complaint to us. We asked for more 
information from NSI, who told us that Mrs M called NSI on 26 July 2021 and an investment 
of £50,000 was made into a direct saver account. 
The call isnt any longer available. Mrs M opted for paperless account maintenance. NSI 
emailed to Mrs M a welcome pack confirming the opening of a direct saver. NSI sent her a 
NSI number and log on details by post. She tried to log on but was unsuccessful  on 12 
August 2021. The first time she logged on was 22 May 2022  which is when she wouldve 
seen she had a direct saver and not PSBs. It was then that she transferred £30,000 to PSBs 
and withdrew the remainder of £20,000.
Because NSI dont have the call in question anymore, they said they have no evidence to 
say if she wanted to invest in PSBs or not. And as PSBs are luck of the draw its not 
possible to say if she wouldve won a large prize or not. But NSI offered to pay the PSB fund 
rate of 1% (increased to 1.4% in June 2022) - £454.25. And they would leave the £86.14 
earned on the direct saver. Plus, NSI increased the compensation offered to £250. So NSI 
offered a total of £790.39.
Mrs M didnt agree. She brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said NSI acted 
reasonably in dealing with Mrs Ms complaint and  he thought the offered compensation was 
fair. There wasnt any firm evidence to say that Mrs M instructed the opening of PSBs. And 
she was sent a welcome pack for a direct saver account.
Mrs M disagreed. She said she wanted a payment which reflected the possibility of winning 
a larger prize. So  her complaint came to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NSI cant provide the call made by Mrs M in July 2021. So, neither NSI nor us can say what 
the call contained. Mrs M said she wanted to open PSBs, but a direct saver was opened 
instead. So here  we have a situation where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear, 
or contradictory (as some of it is here). Therefore, I must base my decision on the balance of 
probabilities. That is  whats more likely than not to have happened in all of the 
circumstances here, based on the available evidence.
On one hand, Mrs M says she wanted to open PSBs. But equally, I can see that she opted 
for paperless  which meant she wouldnt get paper statements in the post. But she was 
sent a welcome pack for a direct saver account  and Ive seen the email she was sent. It 
says we've opened your Direct Saver we'll send you separate confirmation of your NS&I 
number by post. You will be able to log in as soon as you receive this. And so  it wouldve 
been reasonable for Mrs M to have read this email and realised a direct saver had been 
opened. She could then have contacted NSI.
Unfortunately, Mrs M didnt log on until May 2022. So, she didnt see any details of the direct 
saver until then.
But I can see she tried to log on before then  but each time she failed or was sent a new 
temporary password. But I would say that having opted to manage the investment online (i.e. 
go paperless) there was a responsibility for Mrs M to log on and view her investment  
especially as it was a large amount.
Against that, because NSI cant be certain of what was said on the call in July 2021  theyve 
accepted that Mrs M intended to open PSBs. And made an offer to settle her complaint in 
line with that. And therefore, the crux of my decision is - whether the offer is reasonable or 
not. 
NSI have offered:
- £454.25 - the PSB prize fund rate of 1% (1.4% for month of June 2022). This is 
calculated from 26 July 2021 to 23 May 2022 (£50,000) and then from 23 May 2022 
to 30 June 2022 (£30,000).
- £86.14 - earned whilst the funds were in the direct saver: NS&I are not asking for this 
to be repaid.
- £250 payment (increased from £150).
The main issue at hand is the amount of £454.25. As NSI have said, the prize draw for PSBs 
is just that  it is luck of the draw. So  we just cant say whether Mrs M wouldve won a 
larger prize or not. But NSI showed us the data for the prize draws for September 2021 and 
May 2022  the two draws that Mrs M wouldve been eligible for. These show that the 
average prize pay-out for an investment of £50,000 was 1% per annum. Mrs Ms potential 
holding of PSBs was for nine months  and so the average pay-out for that period was £320. 
So  in the light of that data, NSIs offer of £454.25 is very fair  as it is above the average 
pay-out for the investment.
Now  Mrs M argues she may have won a higher prize. But NSIs data shows that the 
chances of that are about 0.27%. Ive considered this further. But - I dont think its fair for me 
to say that she may have won a higher value prize, nor to make a higher award based on 
that possibility.Mrs M has also argued that if the phone call in July 2021 was available, the award would be 
higher. Ive considered this and it wouldnt affect the compensation - because NSI have 
accepted that her intention was to open PSBs. And the chances of her winning a higher 
prize would still be subject to the same considerations as Ive set out. And so  the 
availability of the call isnt relevant here.
Ive considered the other two aspects of NSIs offer and I think they are also reasonable. The 
retaining of the interest of £86.14 is self-explanatory. And looking at the compensation, our 
service has set out some criteria for compensation payments. We say an award up to £300 
might be suitable where there have been repeated small errors, or a larger single mistake, 
requiring a reasonable effort to sort out. Typically, in this range well usually see either some 
inconvenience has been causedor disappointment and loss of expectation. I think what 
happened fits into this definition and so - the award of £250 is also fair.
Putting things right
My decision confirms the award that NSI have offered  and which Mrs M has rejected. This 
is for NSI to pay £704.25 made up as follows:
- £454.25 - the PSB prize fund rate of 1% (1.4% for month of June 2022). This is 
calculated from July 2021 to end of June 2022.
- £250 compensation payment (increased from £150).
And as Ive said, NSI agree to leave the interest earned on the direct saver.(continued)
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. National Savings and Investments have already made an offer to 
pay £704.25 to settle the complaint and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
So my decision is that National Savings and Investments should pay £704.25.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 January 2023.
