The complaint
Mr and Mrs K are unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed their bank 
account. 
What happened 
In 2019 Mr and Mrs K asked NatWest to update their address. NatWest told them theyd 
have to do this over the phone.
NatWest also asked Mr and Mrs K to fill out forms and provide information about their assets 
and liabilities. NatWest had some follow-up questions and asked for further information in 
relation to this, but in July 2019 Mr and Mrs K told the bank theyd provided all the 
information they would be and had nothing more to disclose.
In August 2019 NatWest issued a letter telling Mr and Mrs K that they would be closing their 
account with 60 days notice, and theyd have to move their banking elsewhere. This was 
sent to the old address as it hadnt been updated. NatWest said there was no evidence of
Mr and Mrs K completing the request to change the address, so they had to send letters to 
the address they had on file.
Mr and Mrs K believed NatWest was closing the account because they didnt respond to 
letters. They dont think this is fair because the letters were going to the old address. So
Mr and Mrs K complained to NatWest about their decision to close the account. NatWest 
said it was a commercial decision and it wouldnt be reversed. They also said they werent 
required to explain why the account was closing, they just had to give 60 days notice of the 
closure, which they had.
Mr and Mrs K werent happy with NatWests response and brought their complaint to our 
service. 
One of our investigators looked at the complaint but didnt uphold it. He said NatWest acted 
fairly in closing the account and confirmed the bank didnt have to explain why. He also 
couldnt see any request for Mr and Mrs Ks address to be changed. As a result, he didnt 
think NatWest had to take any further action.
Mr and Mrs K didnt agree and asked for a final decision from an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, Im not going to uphold 
Mr and Mrs Ks complaint. Ill explain why.
The agreement between NatWest and Mr and Mrs K allowed either party to end the banking 
arrangements. In NatWests case, other than for one of the specified reasons for immediate 
closure, they would give 60 days notice. Banking regulations require NatWest to consider the effect of closure and give customers notice before the account closes, to allow them to 
make alternative arrangements.
Theres nothing in the agreement or the regulations that requires NatWest to give customers 
any reasons behind the closure of an account, provided notice is given to the account 
holders. But I do expect the bank to provide me with its reasons  in confidence, if necessary 
 so that I can be satisfied they havent acted unfairly.
Im satisfied, based on what NatWest have provided to us in confidence, that they had 
legitimate reasons for closing the account and that these were not inherently unfair. I dont 
consider it necessary in order to resolve the complaint that NatWest provides Mr and Mrs K 
with any further information regarding the closure. I recognise that must be frustrating for
Mr and Mrs K, but I can assure them that Ive considered NatWests reasoning carefully and 
I wouldve asked them to take action if I wasnt satisfied with their answers.
I understand that Mr and Mrs K have been loyal customers of NatWest for many years and 
feel that the bank is being unfair. And I sympathise that the account closure may have an 
impact on how Mr and Mrs K operate their finances in the future. But that doesnt mean 
NatWest cant decide to close the account and give the appropriate notice to do so. 
Mr and Mrs K have said that they didnt receive 60 days notice because the letter confirming 
this went to an old address and this meant they couldnt respond in time. However, NatWest 
has no evidence of Mr and Mrs K completing the process of changing the address on the 
account. And Mr and Mrs K say they have no evidence of this either. So Im satisfied there 
isnt a proper basis for me to say NatWest should have changed the address on their 
system.
I can accept Mr and Mrs K didnt initially see the letter giving 60 days notice. But I dont think 
this makes a significant difference. The purpose of the letter was to inform
Mr and Mrs K of NatWests intention to close the account, and to give them time to make 
alternative arrangements. It wasnt to request further information in order to prevent the 
account being closed. And Mr and Mrs K were in email correspondence with NatWest before 
the letter was issued in August 2019. In July theyd already said theyd already provided all 
the information they were going to. This was during email correspondence with NatWest 
about what information they needed from Mr and Mrs K about their assets and liabilities.
The account was closed on 24 October 2019. Between this date and the letter giving notice 
in August, Mr and Mrs K were in email contact with NatWest to complain about the account 
closure. While they may not have initially received the postal notice, they had already 
complained to NatWest before the account was closed. So they were clearly aware of the 
closure, albeit even if they found out less than 60 days beforehand.
The account was always going to be closed, which wasnt dependent on whether
Mr and Mrs K responded to the letter giving 60 days notice. And I cant see that not 
receiving the notice or having the full 60 days caused any immediate problems beyond
Mr and Mrs K being unable to use the account in the future. This would always have been 
the case after the closure anyway. So I dont think their address being an old one has had a 
material impact on things here.
Based on what Ive seen, I think NatWest have acted reasonably, so I wont be asking them 
to do anything further.
My final decision
Its my final decision that I dont uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K and Mrs K to 
accept or reject my decision before 21 May 2020.
