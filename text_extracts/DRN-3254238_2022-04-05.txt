The complaint
Mrs K complains that Bank of Scotland plc  trading as Halifax (Halifax) marked her loan as in 
default.
What happened
Mrs K took a loan of £15,000 from Halifax in February 2019. Interest was 11.4% APR and 
monthly repayments were £324.97. The payments were made in March 2019, April 2019, 
and May 2019. In June 2019, the direct debit was unpaid, and no payments were made until 
three manual payments of £424.97 were made in August 2019, October 2019, and 
November 2019. The loan was defaulted and passed to debt collectors in April 2020  the 
balance was £13,269.49. On 15 October 2019, Halifax sent to Mrs K a redemption letter and 
on 23 December 2019, they sent a further redemption letter.
Mrs K complained. She said the default wasnt fair  as she was in the process of arranging 
a remortgage  which would repay Halifaxs loan. Shed asked for a redemption statement in 
September 2019 but this hadnt arrived. She said she had to call Halifax repeatedly to ask 
for it again. When it was sent in December 2019  it was sent in the post rather than 
electronically. So, it was delayed again, and Mrs K said it wasnt received until 8 January 
2020. This meant the remortgage was delayed. And by the time the application was lodged 
with the new lender, the pandemic occurred  which then meant it was delayed further. As a 
result, the loan with Halifax was defaulted  and she said this was the fault of Halifax in not 
sending to her the redemption statement as shed requested. She spent hours trying to get 
through to Halifax on the phone during the pandemic to try to discuss her situation. She 
couldnt now get a mortgage because of the default on her credit file. She said she wanted 
the default removed. 
Halifax said they shouldve sent the early settlement letter to Mrs Ks online mailbox in 
December 2019 but they sent it in the post instead. For that, they apologised and paid 
compensation of £50. They said they sent an early settlement letter to Mrs K in October 
2019. They couldnt find any evidence that Mrs K asked for a further early settlement letter 
between October 2019 and December 2019. Halifax said the default on her loan had been 
applied correctly and couldnt be removed from her credit file. Halifax had given Mrs K many 
breathing space holds on her loan repayments to allow time for the remortgage to take 
place. When Mrs K spoke to Halifax on 3 March 2020, a final 30-day hold was agreed. When 
they didnt hear anymore from Mrs K, the loan was closed and transferred to their recoveries 
team.  A default was registered on her credit file.
Mrs K brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said Halifax acted reasonably. Halifax 
had sent two early settlement letters to Mrs K  in October 2019 and December 2019. While 
they werent sent to Mrs Ks online mailbox, they had been sent to her address. And that 
gave her sufficient time to arrange the remortgage  before the pandemic took hold in March 
2020.  Halifax had sent letters to Mrs K in January 2020 and in March 2020  to say that 
arrears needed to be paid or a default would be applied. Mrs K spoke to Halifax on 8 March 
2020  when a further 30-day hold was agreed. But Mrs K didnt then get back in touch with 
Halifax when that ended in April 2020. 
Mrs K asked that an ombudsman look at her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs K took a loan from Halifax in February 2019  for £15,000. I can see she was in financial 
difficulty soon after that  as she only made three monthly payments to the loan through until 
May 2019. Thereafter, payments stopped until three more manual payments were made 
later in the year. From when the loan was drawn in February 2019 though to April 2020, Mrs 
K made six payments. So, it was clear she was in financial difficulty throughout the period. 
Mrs K intended to arrange a remortgage to repay her debts, including the Halifax loan. She 
asked for an early settlement letter in September 2019 and says she didnt get that. She said 
she called Halifax many times after that and eventually they agreed to send an early 
settlement letter on 23 December 2019. Mrs K says that because of the delays, her 
remortgage fell through  as by the time she submitted everything to her new lenders, the 
pandemic occurred and it couldnt be arranged because of that.
Ive looked at what happened. I can see that Halifax sent an early settlement letter to Mrs Ks 
address on 15 October 2019. Mrs K says she didnt get it and had to call Halifax many times 
to arrange another one. Ive seen Halifaxs records and they dont record that Mrs K called 
them during that period. Mrs K then asked for another letter on 23 December 2019  and 
asked for it to be sent to her Halifax online mailbox. But it was sent in the post instead and 
didnt reach her until around 8 January 2020  she says this caused a further delay. For the 
fact that Halifax sent it in the post, they apologised and paid compensation of £50.
Mrs K says that she called Halifax many times between September 2019 and December 
2019  to chase the redemption letter. Halifax have said they dont have any record of those 
calls  and Ive seen their records which confirm what theyve said. We asked Mrs K for 
evidence of her calls, but unfortunately, she hasnt provided anything.
Ive considered whether its reasonable to say that if its accepted that there was a delay in 
receiving the redemption letter until 8 January 2020  that it wouldve delayed the 
remortgage as Mrs K says it did. The pandemic affected the UK from 23 March 2020  when 
the first lockdown was announced. That gave Mrs Ks lender two and a half months to 
arrange the remortgage. And three months until the end of the 30-day hold arranged on 8 
March 2020. I noted that on Mrs Ks call to Halifax on 23 December 2019, she said it should 
be completed within three weeks. And in January 2020, Mrs K called Halifax to say that the 
paperwork had been submitted to the mortgage lender and a decision was expected within 
30 days time from then. So  Mrs K expected the remortgage to be completed well before 
the lockdown happened later in March 2020. And I think that was a reasonable assumption 
to make. Clearly, I dont know what the approval processes were at Mrs Ks new lender, but I 
think that more than two months was a reasonable time for it to be completed.
We dont know why the remortgage didnt happen. But its fair to say that a lender may 
decline an application for a remortgage for several reasons  for example, loan to value ratio 
being too high, insufficient income/affordability, or suitability of the mortgage term. Mrs K 
hasnt provided any evidence from the lender which says why the remortgage didnt take 
place. 
Halifax agreed several 30 day holds  in June 2019, October 2019, November 2019, 
December 2019, January 2020, and March 2020. I can see that no interest was charged on 
the loan from June 2019. So  Halifax did try to support and help Mrs K. When Mrs K called Halifax on 8 March 2020  a further 30-day hold was agreed. Ive listened to this call, and 
the call handler asked Mrs K to diarise and come back to Halifax after 30 days to let them 
know the position. But  Halifaxs records show that she didnt contact Halifax again. 
The call handler told Mrs K to ignore any regulatory letters. Halifax sent Mrs K a notice of 
arrears on 3 March 2020  which said the arrears of £1,922.96 should be paid. On 15 April 
2020, Halifax wrote to Mrs K to say the debt had defaulted and the full balance was due for 
repayment. The letter said the debt may be passed to a debt collection agency to collect the 
debt.  So, I considered whether Halifax acted fairly here  because Mrs K was told to ignore 
regulatory letters. But equally, she hadnt contacted Halifax at the end of the 30 day hold as 
theyd asked. Nor had any money been paid to the loan. So even if Halifax had, for example, 
delayed any action for a further month, Im not persuaded that the outcome wouldve been 
any different  other than the default wouldve occurred a month later.
I can see that Mrs K feels strongly about her complaint and therefore will be disappointed by 
my decision. But in the circumstances of her case, I think Halifax acted reasonably, and I 
wont be asking them to do anymore here. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 May 2022.
