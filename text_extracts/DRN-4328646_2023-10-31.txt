The complaint
Mr M complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) returned a standing order payment.
What happened
Mr M had an overdraft limit of £1,400.
On 28 March 2013, he had a balance of £407.29 debit. The following four days was the 
Easter bank holiday weekend, starting on Good Friday (29 March 2013) through to Easter 
Monday (1 April 2013). 
The following transactions took place on Mr Ms account:
Date Type of payment Amount
Opening balance  2 April 2013 £407.29 debit
28 March 2013  31 March 2013 ATM withdrawals (5) £160.00
2 April 2013 Direct debits/ Standing order (3) £106.30
2 April 2013 Debit card payments (14) £1,075.25
Balance before loans £1,811.83 debit
2 April 2013 Credits  loans (2) (£660.00)
2 April 2013 Returned standing order (£5)
Closing balance - 2 April 2013 £1,146.83 debit
Barclays returned unpaid one standing order for £5. 
Mr M complained. He said the standing order shouldnt have been returned  as he had 
sufficient funds in his account. He was then charged a return fee of £8. He says he wants 
that refunding, plus interest at 8% per annum. He said Barclays didnt deal with his complaint 
when he emailed them in September 2018  and this was a failing on their part.
In November 2022, Barclays said it wasnt possible to say exactly when each debit was 
applied to Mr Ms account. But the total debits shown on 2 April 2013 wouldve taken Mr M 
over his overdraft limit. So  there werent sufficient funds, and the standing order wasnt 
paid. On their response to the complaint being made in 2018, Barclays said it wasnt 
reasonable to send an email to a personal email address, and the ways to complain are 
shown on their website.
Mr M brought his complaint to us. He showed us the Financial Conduct Authoritys (FCA) 
website  which did show he sent an email to the correct address at Barclays.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint. She said - on 28 March 2013 the closing 
balance was £470.29 debit. There was a total of £1,341.54 in outgoing debits - making the 
closing balance £1,811.83 debit. Given the passage of time, it wasnt possible to determine 
the exact order of the debits, but it was likely that the debit card payments were reflected in 
the available balance immediately  even though the actual debits to the account were 
shown later, when the merchants claimed payment. So  it was likely that Mr Ms balance 
was shown as £1,811.83, and that was the basis on which the pay or no pay decision was 
made. 
She followed up her view and addressed Mr Ms points about Barclays complaint handling 
process and expanded on her view about the debits.
She could see that Mr M initially got a non-delivery message, so he could see the email 
hadnt been delivered  in July 2018. Mr M then emailed a specific person, but Barclays said 
no email had been received. But on the other hand, Mr M didnt chase this up with Barclays 
until November 2022  two years later. While this was frustrating, she didnt think Barclays 
wouldve responded any differently in 2018 (if theyd looked at Mr Ms complaint then) as 
when they did so in 2022.
She considered that it was unlikely the two loans wouldve gone into Mr Ms account early on 
2 April 2013  so wouldnt have been included in the balance. She asked Mr M if hed called 
Barclays at the time (to explain what was happening on his account)  but he couldnt be 
sure if he did.
So on balance, our investigator didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr M asked for a Subject Access Request (SAR) from our service to give him information 
with which to respond. And asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint, and so it has 
come to me to make a final decision. (continued)
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I checked that weve sent Mr M the documents requested under the SAR  and these were 
sent on 13 September 2023. I noted he hasnt made any further comments on his complaint 
since that time.Return of standing order - £5:
The crux of Mr Ms complaint comes down to what balance Barclays wouldve seen when 
they made the decision to return the standing order on 2 April 2013. With the passage of 
time, and changes in banking systems  Barclays cant be specific about their IT and 
approval systems in 2013. 
So - where the information Ive got is incomplete, or unclear (as some of it is here), I must 
base my decision on the balance of probabilities. That is  whats more likely than not to 
have happened in all of the circumstances here, based on the available evidence.
My role isnt to say whether Barclays were right, or not to return the standing order, but to 
consider what information Barclays had to make that decision.
I considered what likely happened. And here, I think it is very likely that all the transactions 
wouldve shown in Mr Ms projected balance when Barclays opened for business on 2 April 
2013. 
The two direct debits and one standing order (for £5) wouldve been shown as items which 
were to about to be debited to Mr Ms account  they wouldve been loaded onto Barclays 
systems and shown in Mr Ms projected balance before they were applied to Mr Ms 
account on 2 April 2013.
The same goes for the debit card payments - even though they were applied to Mr Ms 
account on 2 April 2013, the actual purchases wouldve been made one or two days before  
and Barclays wouldve seen in advance the debits were to be applied.
And looking at the ATM withdrawals made over the bank holiday weekend  these wouldve 
been shown in Mr Ms balance immediately.
So  Im satisfied that Barclays wouldve seen Mr Ms projected balance as £1,811.82 debit 
on 2 April 2013 and took the decision to return the standing order unpaid based on that 
information.
I dont think its likely that the loan funds of £660 wouldve been shown in the balance, and I 
think its probable those arrived into Mr Ms account later on the day of 2 April 2013, after the 
decision to return the standing order had been made.
We did ask Mr M if he made contact with Barclays to advise them of his situation, and 
(presumably) let them know that the loan funds were due to come into his account, but he 
cant recollect that he did.
Mr Ms complaint to Barclays  September 2018:
Mr M argues that Barclays failed to address his complaint when he emailed them in 
September 2018. I accept that he sent an email to the Barclays address  which was as 
shown on the FCAs website. Barclays, for their part, cant explain what happened to this, 
nor why it wasnt dealt with. 
But equally, Mr M didnt chase this up with Barclays for more than two years.  And while that 
doesnt excuse Barclays for not responding to his email in September 2018, I must reach a 
balanced conclusion based on what happened. And  I dont think its unreasonable to have 
expected Mr M to have followed up with Barclays before he did  to see what had happened 
to his email. And theres nothing in Barclays records to show he did - by correspondence or 
phone.So here, while I accept that Mr M will be disappointed by my decision, on balance and in the 
circumstances of this case, Im not going to ask Barclays to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 November 2023.
