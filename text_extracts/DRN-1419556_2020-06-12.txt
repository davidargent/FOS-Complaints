Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Rs complaint and thought the loans from loan two 
onwards shouldnt have been given as loan one was still outstanding and Mr R had 
borrowing with other short-term credit providers. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint for loans nine and ten. We put the 
offer to Mr R, but he rejected it.
DRN-1419556While the complaint was waiting to be considered by an ombudsman, the complaint was 
further reviewed. The second adjudicator concluded none of the lending should have been 
given because of the term of the loan one and taking into consideration Mr Rs financial 
circumstances.
Neither party responded. So, as the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me 
to decide in my role as ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in full. 
Like the second adjudicator, I think the term of loan one  14 months for high-cost credit  
the total amount to be repaid if it ran to term  £2,978, and the monthly commitment of 
around £200 for that length of time, should have caused Sunny to carry out additional and 
more robust checks about Mr Rs financial circumstances. 
Finding out more about a consumers financial situation can be done by a variety of ways 
and could include asking for copies of pay slips, bills and receipts etc. In this case, Mr R sent 
us copies of his bank statements from around the time of the borrowing which Ive reviewed. 
Its clear from those statements that just prior to loan one being granted, Mr R was having 
problems managing his money. I see he was making monthly repayments to three other 
short-term credit providers which I think was a clear indication Mr R was struggling with his 
finances. An additional commitment over 14 months would have only made his financial 
position worse. And I think it is clear this happened as Mr R returned to borrow an additional 
£900 a week later and which was also for a 14 month term. So, I dont think it was fair of 
Sunny to have given Mr R this borrowing as he was already in what would appear to be a 
dire financial situation. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr R was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr R had taken out six loans within 11 months. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr R was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying his previous loan (the loans were being repaid before the agreed 
term) was leaving in his finances and that Mr Rs indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
 
Mr R was sometimes provided with a new loan within days or weeks of settling a 
previous one. Loan four was taken out the same day that Mr R settled loan two and 
loan seven was taken a week after loan three was repaid, as examples. This would 
indicate that the borrowing was unsustainable for Mr R, and he was persistently 
reliant upon this type of credit.
 
Mr R wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan ten was 
taken out 17 months after Mr Rs first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr R had paid 
large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Mr R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing him
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr R borrowed was likely to
have had negative implications on Mr Rs ability to access mainstream credit and so
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr R paid on all of the loans;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans one to five from Mr Rs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information recorded
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans six to ten should be removed from
Mr Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Rs complaint. Elevate Credit International 
Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 July 2020.
