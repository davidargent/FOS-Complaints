Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Bs complaint  and thought  the loans from loan two 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. Uncle Buck disagreed and the complaint was passed  to 
me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN28794392refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  was required to establish 
whether Mr B could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
Mr B didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion about loan one. Because of this I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  this loan. So, I wont be making a decision  
about this lending. But this was part of the borrowing relationship Mr B had with Uncle  Buck. 
So, this is something  I will take into account  when considering the other  loans he took
As our adjudicator explained, the information Uncle Buck gathered when  Mr B applied  for 
loans two to seven showed that Mr B was having problems managing  his money and had a 
number of other short-term lending commitments that were outstanding. Having seen this 
information, Uncle Buck shouldve  realised  it would be unlikely that Mr B would be able to 
repay his borrowing sustainably without undue difficulty. So, these loans should not have 
been given to him. 
Uncle Buck  disagreed with what the adjudicator had said  it said that at the time it provided 
loan two to Mr B, the credit report it used showed that he currently  had no short term loans  - 
and that a credit report produced in 2015 would also not be a fair reflection of Mr Bs 
financial situation in 2017, when it provided loan seven.
But looking  at the credit report provided by Uncle Buck, while Mr B may not have currently 
had any open  short-term loans  but it seems that he had seven in the six months prior to his 
application for loan two. The repayments to these loans were  significant  and likely to have  
left a shortfall in his income. It also shows that Mr B had a high level of unsecured debt and 
was having trouble managing his finances. And while a credit report generated in 2015 may 
not be reflective of Mr Bs situation  in 2017, it is clear to me that Uncle  Buck shouldve ended  
its lending relationship with Mr B at loan two. 
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans two to seven  and Uncle Buck  should  put 
things right.
Ref: DRN28794393putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans two to seven;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans two to seven  from Mr Bs credit  file;
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Uncle  Buck  to take off tax from this interest.  Uncle Buck  must 
give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Bs complaint. Uncle Buck  Finance 
LLP should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2020.
