K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) lent to him irresponsibly by 
allowing him to extend  his overdraft and take out loans despite  having debt with other 
lenders. Mr M would like a full refund of interest  and charges  plus statutory interest.
background
Mr M has been a customer of NatWests since 2011.  Since  2011  Mr M has applied for a 
number of loans  and increases to his overdraft limit. Most of the applications were declined.
In Jan 2017 NatWest did approve two loans and both were  paid back  in full before any 
repayments were due.
And in May 2017 NatWest agreed an arranged overdraft and an increase to the limit in June 
2017. 
In September  2017 NatWest received a financial difficulty  referral  from third parties with 
payment proposals.  This was discussed with Mr M but he did not wish for any arrangement 
to be put in place as he didnt want a default to be applied to his account. And because his 
account was within its agreed overdraft limit NatWest did not set up any formal repayment  
arrangement.
Mr M complained to NatWest that it had lent irresponsibly to him since 2013 and that the 
interest and charges applied to his account had caused him to go into further financial 
difficulty. 
NatWest denied it had lent irresponsibility. NatWest says all its credit risk procedures  were 
carried out prior to agreeing any lending and that all charges applied  to Mr Ms account  were 
in line with the terms and conditions of the account  and no errors had occurred.
Our adjudicator looked into Mr Ms complaint but didnt think  NatWest  had done  anything 
wrong. He thought it was up to NatWest to decide its own lending  criteria for affordability and 
that the lending criteria set was reasonable and adhered to. He didnt think  NatWest  had 
done anything  wrong in agreeing the loans and overdraft.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And having  done so, Im in agreement 
with our adjudicator  that NatWest didnt do anything  wrong when it agreed to lend to Mr M 
and Ill explain why.
Mr M says that if NatWest had lent responsibly  and carried out its checks  properly it would 
have seen on his credit file and bank  statements he had loans with other companies and 
gambling transactions and wouldnt have lent to him.
But its up to NatWest to set its own lending assessment criteria and providing its checks  are 
appropriate and Mr M met its affordability  assessment criteria I cant  say it has done 
anything wrong.
Ref: DRN38772802I accept Mr M may have had some  adverse entries  on his credit  report  and other loans but 
from what I understand at the time Mr M applied for the loans  and overdraft most of these 
entries wouldnt have  shown up or werent applicable at the time. And a customers credit 
report is only one of a number of factors we would  expect  a business to take into 
consideration when carrying out an affordability assessment.
Other factors  may include the customers income  and expenditure, account activity  and 
management and internal  lending history.
From the information I have seen at the time NatWest agreed to lend to Mr M his income far 
exceeded his expenditure and NatWest had never been in a position where it had had to 
report any negative information  on his credit file.
And although Mr M bank  statements may have shown up gambling  transactions in the past 
its not up to NatWest to tell Mr M how to spend  his money if its not aware of any difficulties. 
And I dont  think it would be fair of NatWest to never lend again  solely  based on the past.  
So I know  this will come as a disappointment,  but I dont think  NatWest did anything wrong 
lending to Mr M. So I wont  be asking  it to do anything.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ms complaint against  National Westminster Bank 
Plc.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019..
