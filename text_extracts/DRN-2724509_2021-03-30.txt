The complaint
Mr H has complained about how Preferred Mortgages Limited has treated him whilst hes 
been in financial difficulties. Mr Hs complaint can be broken down into the following broad 
categories:
Request for a temporary switch to interest-only
Litigation
Fees and charges
Communication
Credit file.  
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
Although Ive read and considered the whole file, Ill keep my comments to what I think is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point, its not because Ive not considered it but 
because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach the right outcome.
Ive read and understood everything Mr H has told us about his health and Ive a great deal 
of sympathy for what hes been  and is going  through. I wont go into any detail about his 
ill-health in this decision to protect his privacy, but I have taken it into account.
As our investigator has explained, we can only deal with matters that happened before the 
complaint was progressed with us in October 2019. Anything that has happened since then 
 including any fees and charges added to the account - would need to be raised as a new 
complaint with Preferred. If Mr H was unhappy with Preferreds response then he could refer 
that to us as a new complaint at the time (subject to our usual rules, of course).
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Interest-only
Mr H requested a switch to interest-only in September 2018. At that time he was in arrears 
and Preferred asked him to complete an income and expenditure form and provide medical 
evidence as Mr H had explained about his ill-health.
After correspondence back and forth Preferred received the income and expenditure 
information from Mr H, but the medical evidence was still outstanding.
Unfortunately, the information Mr H provided showed his outgoings were higher than his 
income so even if the mortgage was changed to interest-only it would still have been 
unaffordable.
I understand Mr H feels a change to interest-only would help him, but interest-only would 
normally only be considered as a short-term measure, for example for a consumer that was 
briefly out of work just to give them a month or so breathing space. Its not normally 
considered a long-term option for financial difficulties, as it just moves the problem further 
down the line. Mr H has no way of repaying an interest-only mortgage at the end of the term, 
and a temporary switch to interest-only would mean his payments would be even higher by 
the time the mortgage was switched back to capital repayment, so would make things worse 
in the longer term.
Arrears reporting is based on the number of months in arrears a person is, so a change to 
interest-only  if the payments then still werent affordable and so werent made  could 
actually make things worse. To explain (Ive taken the approximate figures from April 2017).
On a repayment basis (as this mortgage is) Mr H needed to pay £482 a month. At the start 
of the month he was £539 in arrears, and at the end of the month he was £1,021 in arrears. 
If you divide the amount of arrears by the monthly payment you get that Mr H was 
1.1 months in arrears at the start of the month, and 2.1 months in arrears at the end of the 
month.
If the account had been switched to interest-only then the monthly payment would have 
been £187. Dividing those same amounts of arrears (£539 and £1,021) by the now lower 
monthly payment (£187) you get that Mr H was 2.9 months in arrears at the start of the 
month, and 5.5 months in arrears at the end of the month.
So on a repayment basis the account was recorded as 1.1 months and 2.1 months in 
arrears, but if the account had been switched to interest-only those arrears would instead 
have been recorded as 2.9 months and 5.5 months; a much worse situation and one more 
likely to proceed to litigation.
Having considered everything Im satisfied Preferred didnt treat Mr H unfairly when it didnt 
agree to switch his mortgage onto an interest-only basis.
Litigation
As Mr Hs income and expenditure information showed his outgoings were higher than his 
income, there were no options available to Preferred to make changes to the mortgage to 
help Mr H. Anything it did would be unaffordable, other than allowing Mr H to live in the 
house and not have to make any payments, and that wouldnt be something Preferred would 
be expected to do.
Preferred asked Mr H to send the medical evidence as that was still outstanding, and also 
asked for proof the property was on the market as Mr H said he was selling it. Preferred put 
a 30-day hold on the account to prevent further action being taken whilst it awaited that 
information.
As the information wasnt received Preferred moved things to litigation. By that time Mr H 
hadnt made any payments in over a year, and it had been six-months since a payment had 
been received from the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP). Mr H had said the 
property had been on the market for around six-months at that point.
Whilst Ive great deal of sympathy for the situation Mr H was in, having considered 
everything very carefully I dont think Preferred acted unreasonably when it decided to move 
things forward to litigation at that time.Mr H said he wasnt notified in advance of the court hearing, so he wanted the order set 
aside. Preferreds solicitor wrote to Mr H on 26 June 2019 to let him know the hearing was 
set for 7 August 2019. As that letter was correctly addressed, Im satisfied enough was done 
by Preferred and its solicitor to make Mr H aware of the date of the hearing.
Fees and charges
As was agreed, we can only look at the fees and charges that were incurred between 
September 2013 and October 2019.

Ive considered the remaining fees very carefully, along with the contact notes, Mr Hs 
submissions and the conduct of the account. Having done so I think all the remaining AMFs 
were fairly charged apart from one, which I will detail below. The AMFs were charged when 
the account was in arrears and a full payment hadnt been made. Whilst I acknowledge 
Mr Hs difficulties, the AMFs are an integral part of the account and can be charged in these 
circumstances. Having considered everything there are no grounds for me to order these be 
reversed, other than one. 
The fee charged on 3 April 2017 was following Mr H paying £350 of the £482 due in March, 
and a phone call between the parties on 29 March. At that time the interest due was around 
£187 so the £350 payment more than covered that. In that call it was recorded that Mr H 
said he wont have any income for three months and he needed some help. It was recorded 
that he had a negative disposable income. 
The account was referred to a specialist team, but the follow up call wasnt made until 
5 April. In that call it was agreed that Mr H wouldnt make a payment for the next three 
months, but by then hed already been charged the AMF for March. It seems Preferred 
accepted Mr H couldnt afford his payments at that time, yet he still managed to pay £350 of 
the £482 due, so all things considered Im satisfied the AMF charged on 3 April 2017 should 
be reversed off the account.
Preferred has provided copies of the invoices it received from its legal representatives and 
Im satisfied those match the amounts charged to Mr Hs mortgage account. Under the terms 
and conditions of the account Preferred is allowed to pass on any third-party costs it incurs 
on the account  such as legal fees  onto Mr H, so Preferred did nothing wrong in adding 
those legal costs onto Mr Hs mortgage account.
Having considered everything, Preferred should reverse all the fees and charges listed in the 
first table (if it hasnt already done so), and also reverse the £55 AMF charged on 3 April 
2017.
Communication
Mr H often used a contact us form on Preferreds website. I understand Mr H felt some of 
his messages should have been dealt with as complaints, but as our investigator explained, 
wording such as I request that you move me to an interest only arrangement for 2 years 
would be dealt with as an enquiry to amend an account, not a formal complaint. For that 
reason, we cant hold Preferred liable for not responding to everything using the formal 
complaints procedure.
Mr H has said that because Preferred doesnt have a time stamp on its website contact form 
page then he doesnt know when each of his messages was submitted. Hes also 
commented on the fact not all the letters he received from Preferred have a complaint 
reference number or date on them. Were not the regulator and its not our role to tell a 
business how it should operate in general terms. Whilst I can understand how it would help Mr H keep track of matters, these arent things I could order Preferred to change as it isnt 
within my power to do so.
Whilst it is clear there has been a lot of communication between the parties, I cant see any 
of Mr Hs messages werent dealt with in some form, and so I dont uphold this part of Mr Hs 
complaint.
Credit file
Mr H has asked that Preferred change the adverse information recorded on his credit file, 
but unfortunately that isnt something we would order Preferred to do.
Its normal industry practice for a lender to record any arrears on a credit file. In fact, lenders 
have a duty to report that information. In this case I dont think Preferred did anything wrong 
in reporting the true arrears position of Mr Hs mortgage account. The fact some AMFs will 
be refunded is unconnected to the credit file reporting. The credit file reporting has to be a 
true statement of Mr Hs account, so all the time his mortgage is in arrears his credit file will 
reflect that.
Putting things right
Preferred needs to remove the following debits from Mr Hs mortgage account (if it hasnt 
already done so), backdated to the date each was charged for interest purposes:
Date Description Amount
28 April 2014 Arrears Management Fee (AMF) £70
28 July 2014 AMF £70

4 October 2017 AMF £55

11 January 2018 Legal Costs (part of the overall £801 charged) £159
6 March 2018 AMF £35
3 September 2018 AMF £35
4 October 2018 AMF £35
3 January 2019 AMF £35
6 March 2019 AMF £35
24 April 2019 AMF £35
3 August 2019 AMF £35
6 September 2019 Legal Costs £243.20
4 October 2019 AMF 35
I make no other order or award.
  My final decision
I uphold this complaint and order Preferred Mortgages Limited to remove the debits Ive set 
out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 April 2021.
