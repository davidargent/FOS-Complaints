The complaint
Mrs B complains Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax provided poor customer service.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. 
Instead, I will focus on the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs B had an overdraft with Halifax. In May 2022 Halifax agreed not to charge her interest 
until November 2022. In June 2022, it sent her a letter saying it would start charging interest. 
This was a mistake which stemmed from Mrs Cs overdraft position changing from 
unauthorised to authorised. 
When Mrs B contacted Halifax, it quickly recognised its mistake, ensured interest would not 
be charged until November 2022, apologised and paid Mrs B Â£50 compensation. While I 
take onboard what Mrs C has said about her husbands health, I find this was a fair and 
reasonable resolution to the complaint.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 April 2023.
