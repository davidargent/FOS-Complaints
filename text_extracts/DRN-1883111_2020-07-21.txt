The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that Ulster Bank Ltd sent him a letter which implied hed closed his account, 
when it was them who closed the account. 
What happened
Having closed Mr S account, Ulster Bank sent him a letter which included the phrase from 
the date you closed your account. Mr S is unhappy as he didnt close his account, Ulster 
Bank did. 
One of our investigators looked into this and agreed the letter had been incorrectly worded. 
But he didnt think anything further needed to be done to resolve the complaint. Mr S 
disagrees and has asked for an ombudsman to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ulster Bank accept that the letter should have read we closed your account  they say they 
apologise if this upset Mr S. But they pointed out that Mr S was well aware that it was them, 
not him, that closed the account and that this was a minor administrative error. 
I agree the letter is incorrectly worded. But Im not persuaded that this had such an impact 
on Mr S that compensation needs to be paid. Sometimes, mistakes happen. Here, Ulster 
Bank have apologised and even though that apology was shared with our service rather than 
directly with Mr S, I consider that sufficient.
I appreciate Mr S has very strong feelings on this matter and Im also aware there is a 
separate complaint being considered by another ombudsman about the account closure 
decision itself  something I make no comment on here. Overall, I accept that Ulster Bank 
made an error, but Im not going to tell them to do anything further to resolve this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 August 2020.
