The complaint
Mrs M complains about the amount that shes been charged by Toyota Financial Services 
(UK) plc for damage to a car that she returned at the end of her hire agreement.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mrs M under a hire agreement with Toyota Financial Services in 
2017. The agreement had a term of three years and Mrs M returned the car at the end of the 
agreement. It was inspected by a third party on behalf of Toyota Financial Services in 
August 2020 and eleven areas of damage to the car, with a total cost of £1,114.20, were 
identified.
Toyota Financial Services charged that amount to Mrs M but she didnt agree with the 
charges so complained to it. She wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this 
service. Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He said that 
the inspection report showed that the car was returned with multiple damages that had 
exceeded fair wear and tear guidelines and that he didnt think it would be fair or reasonable 
to ask Toyota Financial Services to waive any of the charges. 
Mrs M has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has responded 
in detail and says, in summary, that:
the legality of the basis of assessment and of the charges hasnt been properly 
considered;
Toyota Financial Services has chosen to unilaterally impose only parts of the 
guidelines and has ignored the parts which protect her;
she doesnt confirm or deny whether the evidence provided by Toyota Financial 
Services is genuine and a fair reflection of the actual condition of the car;
she should be able to negotiate and agree with Toyota Financial Services the 
definition of fair wear and tear;
she should be able to physically examine any damage;
she should be afforded a reasonable period of time to take possession of the car and 
have any damage repaired; and
if that isnt possible because Toyota Financial Services has sold the car, she would 
expect that her cost should be limited to the provable and documented cost incurred 
by it on the alleged damaged areas prior to the sale.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the hire agreement said that the car must be returned at the end of the agreement: 
in good condition (fair wear and tear excepted); and that: If the returned Goods 
are not in a reasonable condition for the age and mileage, you must also immediately 
pay to us the cost of putting them in that condition or (if we choose) the reduction in 
the value caused by them not being in reasonable condition;
Toyota Financial Services wrote to Mrs M in April 2020 about the government 
imposed restrictions in response to the pandemic and that letter said: If the vehicle 
does have excess mileage or damage which are outside of the BVLRAs fair wear 
and tear guidelines, we will address these with you after the vehicle has been 
collected;
Toyota Financial Services arranged for the car to be inspected in August 2020 and 
eleven areas of damage to the car were identified  the inspection report recorded 
the cars mileage as 18,519, included photos of the damage and said that the total 
cost of the damage was £1,114.20;
the BVLRA is the British Vehicle Leasing and Rental Association which is an 
independent organisation and its guidelines on fair wear and tear are widely used in 
the car hire industry as a standard for fair wear and tear - Toyota Financial Services 
says that its not a member of that Association but it uses its guidelines as a 
recognised industry standard;
although the hire agreement didnt refer to the BVLRA guidelines on fair wear tear, 
the letter that was sent by Toyota Financial Services to Mrs M in April 2020 did refer 
to them and I consider that its fair and reasonable for Toyota Financial Services to 
use those guidelines to assess whether damage to a car is fair wear and tear;
Mrs M had agreed to return the car in a good condition and I consider that the photos 
in the inspection report are enough to show that the car wasnt returned in a good 
condition and I consider that the damage was more than would reasonably be 
considered to be fair wear and tear;
I consider that Mrs M ought reasonably to have been aware that she had to return 
the car in a good condition and that she would be responsible for any damage that 
wasnt fair wear and tear but she returned the car in a damaged condition - Im not 
persuaded that there was any requirement for Toyota Financial Services to return the 
car to her so that she could arrange for the damage to be repaired  she had the 
opportunity to have the damage repaired before she returned the car but didnt do so;
Im not persuaded that there was any requirement for Toyota Financial Services to 
have the car repaired and I consider that its fair and reasonable for it to make the 
charges for the damage which were recommended by the third party in the inspection 
report  Im not persuaded that those charges are excessive or unreasonable;
I sympathise with Mrs M for the costs that she now has to pay but I consider that she 
returned the car with damage that was more than would reasonably be considered to 
be fair wear and tear  and I consider that its fair and reasonable for Toyota 
Financial Services to charge her for that damage; 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Toyota Financial 
Services has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mrs M about the return of the car; 
and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Toyota Financial Services to reduce, or waive, the amount that its charged Mrs M for 
the damage to the car, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint. 
Mrs M says that the charge isnt within her financial means. If shes unable to pay the 
charges, I suggest that she contacts Toyota Financial Services to try to agree an affordable repayment arrangement for the amount that she owes to it. Its required to respond to any 
financial difficulties that shes experiencing positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 May 2021.
