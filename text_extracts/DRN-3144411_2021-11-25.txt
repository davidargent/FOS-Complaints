The complaint
Mr V complains that National Westminster Bank Plc lent irresponsibly when it approved two 
loans.   
What happened
Mr V successfully applied for a NatWest loan of £8,000 in October 2016. In December 2017 
a loan for £12,000 was approved by NatWest. Mr V has told us the loan payments werent 
affordable in the long term. 
Mr V complained and NatWest sent him a final response. NatWest said Mr Vs loans were 
approved after it carried out checks and applied its lending criteria to his applications. 
NatWest didnt agree it had lent irresponsibly. 
Mr V referred his complaint to this service. In June 2021 our investigator asked NatWest to 
provide information, including evidence to show the checks it completed for both loans 
before they were approved. Despite several further requests and emails from the 
investigator, no response was received from NatWest. Mr V provided bank statements and 
evidence of his income and outgoings at the time the loans were approved. 
In the absence of a response from NatWest and considering the information Mr V supplied, 
the investigator upheld his complaint. They thought NatWest had lent irresponsibly when it 
approved both the first and second loans. 
The investigator asked NatWest to respond to their findings by 3 November 2021. On 4 
November 2021 the investigator contacted both Mr V and NatWest to explain they were 
referring his complaint to an ombudsman as no response had been received. The 
investigator asked NatWest to respond by 18 November 2021 but no further contact has 
been received. As the investigator has upheld Mr Vs complaint and NatWest hasnt 
responded, this complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr V complains that NatWest lent irresponsibly when it approved personal loans in 2016 and 
2017. Whilst I can see NatWest rejected Mr Vs complaint and gave its reasoning in the final 
response, it hasnt provided supporting information that show the checks it completed. So 
whilst I can see NatWest set out the types of checks it says it completed before approving 
both loans, without seeing the evidence to verify what its said, I cant say its demonstrated 
proportionate checks were carried out. 
Given the size of the loans and Mr Vs existing credit, I think NatWest shouldve carried out 
some reasonably comprehensive checks to ensure the repayments were sustainable. I note 
Mr V banks with NatWest and hes also provided statements to show his everyday spending. 
Ive looked at the available information, including Mr Vs bank statements for the three month 
period before both loans were approved. In line with the investigators findings, Mr Vs 
income appears to have been taken up by existing living expenses without leaving capacity 
for additional loan payments of £216 and £307 to be sustainably made. Based on the 
information available, I agree the loans Mr V applied for appear unaffordable. 
I think its reasonable to note Mr V was later unable to maintain the loan payments in the 
long term. 
Im satisfied NatWest has been asked to provide supporting information on several 
occasions since June 2021 and that the investigator sent their findings setting out why they 
intended to uphold Mr Vs complaint. NatWest has also been sent confirmation this case has 
been appealed and asked to provide further comment and information. As Ive said above, 
the available information indicates that if NatWest had carried out more comprehensive 
checks I think it wouldve found the loans Mr V applied for were not affordable.
Based on the available information, I agree that NatWest lent irresponsibly when it approved 
Mr Vs loans. As a result, Im upholding Mr Vs complaint. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to settle 
as follows: 
- Refund all interest, fees and charges applied to both loans
- If outstanding balances remain once the above adjustments have been made, 
NatWest or its agents should contact Mr V to arrange suitable repayment plans
- If the effect of refunding all interest, fees and charges to the loan accounts results in 
there no longer being an outstanding balance, any extra should be treated as an 
overpayment and returned to Mr V along with 8% simple interest from the date they 
were made (if they were) until the date of settlement
- Remove all adverse information recorded about both loans from Mr Vs credit file
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NatWest to deduct tax from this interest. NatWest must 
give Mr V a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if they ask for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 December 2021.
