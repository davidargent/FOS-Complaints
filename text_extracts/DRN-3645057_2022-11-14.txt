The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) restricted his account while 
completing a fraud investigation, then removed funds from his account as a result of the 
investigation.
Mr Ss complaint has been brought by a representative. As the account is held in Mr Ss 
name, Ill refer to Mr S throughout the decision.
What happened
Mr S holds an account with NatWest. In July 2021, NatWest received a fraud claim from 
someone who paid funds into Mr Ss account  Ill refer to that individual as G. While 
investigating the fraud claim, NatWest placed a restriction on Mr Ss account so no funds 
could be removed. At the conclusion of their fraud investigation on 1 July 2021, they 
removed the restriction and debited Mr Ss account and sent £1,200 to the bank that 
submitted the fraud claim.
Mr S raised a complaint with NatWest as he was unhappy they had restricted his account 
and saying they shouldnt have removed the £1,200 from his account. NatWest looked into 
Mr Ss complaint and upheld it in part. They said the restriction was applied fairly while they 
completed their fraud investigation, however they accepted that the dispute between Mr S 
and the sender of the funds was a civil dispute  as such  they shouldnt have removed the 
£1,200 from Mr Ss account. NatWest told Mr S they had contacted the other bank and 
requested the return of the funds. NatWest apologised to Mr S and paid him £350 
compensation for incorrectly removing the funds.
Mr S wasnt happy with NatWests response, so he brought a complaint to our service.
While the complaint was with our service, the funds were returned from the other bank and 
paid into Mr Ss account in August 2022.
An investigator looked into Mr Ss complaint and didnt uphold it. They agreed that NatWest 
had incorrectly removed the funds from Mr Ss account, however they felt the £350 was fair 
compensation for the impact this had on Mr S. The investigator felt it was reasonable for 
NatWest to place a restriction on Mr Ss account based on them receiving a fraud claim, and 
for it to remain while they investigated that claim.
Mr S disagreed with the investigators opinion saying £350 doesnt adequately address: the 
impact of him not having use of these funds, the impact of these funds being removed from 
his account, the restriction being placed on his account and the overall time this matter has 
taken to resolve. Mr S raised a point about a holiday having to be cancelled due to him not 
having access to these funds.
As Mr S disagreed with the investigators opinion, the case was passed to me to review.
Having reviewed the case, I contacted NatWest about their refund of £1,200 as there wasnt 
any mention of interest being calculated and paid for the time Mr S was without the money. 
NatWest agreed to pay simple interest at 8% calculated from the date the funds were 
removed from Mr Ss account to the date they were returned.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Should NatWest have removed the money from Mr Ss account?
From what Ive seen NatWest contacted Mr S on receiving the fraud claim to get his side of 
the story and to find out why the payment was originally made into his account. While 
NatWest carried out its fraud investigation it placed a block on Mr Ss account to prevent the 
funds being removed, in case they upheld the fraud claim. Based on a fraud claim being 
received, Im satisfied that NatWest acted reasonably in placing a restriction on Mr Ss 
account while they carried out an investigation.
However, Im not satisfied that NatWest shouldve taken the money out of Mr Ss account 
and returned it to the other bank. I say this based on the information Mr S gave them about 
the payment into his account. Its clear that G (who paid the money into Ss account) was a 
family friend and there was a personal situation which had resulted in G later raising a fraud 
claim. Im not satisfied that the evidence NatWest had, including Mr Ss testimony, 
suggested that Mr S didnt have a legitimate claim to the funds  so they shouldnt have 
been removed from his account.
NatWest have refunded Mr S and paid the money back into his account. They have also 
offered to pay interest on that refund at 8% simple interest, calculated from the date the 
funds left Mr Ss account until the date they were returned to him. This is in line with what I 
wouldve recommended.
The impact NatWests actions have had on Mr S
NatWest have already offered to pay Mr S £350 compensation for the distress he was 
caused due to the funds being removed from his account incorrectly. Having considered 
everything very carefully, this offer is more than I wouldve recommended in the 
circumstances and Ill explain why.
Mr S says that he suffered significant and ongoing emotional distress due to what happened. 
He has also referred to a family holiday that was unable to proceed due to the events.
In considering what is fair compensation for Mr S, I can only take into account the results of 
NatWests actions. I cant award based on the overall emotional distress caused by G raising 
a fraud claim, or by Gs bank in issuing a fraud claim to NatWest.  Also, as I think NatWest 
acted reasonably in placing the restriction on Mr Ss account while they completed their 
investigation, I cant award compensation in relation to this action.
From what Ive seen, Mr Ss account had a balance of over £6,000 in it after the £1,200 had 
been returned to Gs bank. This balance had been maintained at this level for a significant 
period of time prior to the fraud claim. Because of this, Im not satisfied that not having 
access to the £1,200, significantly impacted Mr S. And having considered the length of time 
it took NatWest to return the £1,200 to Mr S, and the impact of them removing the money 
incorrectly in the first place, Im satisfied that the £350 already offered by NatWest is more 
than I wouldve recommended in the circumstances.I appreciate that Mr S is going to be very disappointed as this has been a particularly difficult 
situation for him and his family based on Gs actions. However, Im not going to ask NatWest 
to pay anything more than the £350 theyve already offered in compensation. But NatWest 
should calculate and pay 8% simple interest on the £1,200 from the date the funds left       
Mr Ss account until the date they were returned.
Putting things right
To put things right National Westminster Bank Plc should:
Pay interest at 8% simple on the £1,200 refund, calculated from the date the funds 
left Mr Ss account until the date of their return.
Pay Mr S £350 compensation, if it hasnt already done so.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc and 
require it to compensate Mr S as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 December 2022.
