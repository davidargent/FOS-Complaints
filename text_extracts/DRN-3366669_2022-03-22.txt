The complaint
Mr S complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his account, withheld 
funds held in it, told him he could collect his funds when he couldnt, and then caused severe 
delay in returning them to him.   
What happened
In January 2020, Mr S opened a new account with NatWest. He then deposited a cheque 
into it. Around a week later, NatWest wrote to Mr S explaining it was not proceeding with his 
application for his bank account as he does not meet its criteria. 
In that letter, Mr S was told he could go into a NatWest branch with ID to collect his balance. 
Mr S says he went into the branch shortly after, but NatWests staff said they couldnt give 
him the funds. 
NatWest said it was carrying out a review and gave no timescale to Mr S as to how long it 
would take. NatWest didnt complete its review until late May 2020. Shortly after the funds 
held in Mr S were released to him. 
NatWest accepted it had taken longer than it should have in carrying out its review. 
One of our Investigators looked into the matter, and whilst doing so NatWest made an offer 
of £300 as compensation to resolve Mr S complaint. 
In summary, our Investigator concluded: 
- NatWest was meeting legal and regulatory obligations whilst restricting funds in 
Mr Ss account 
- NatWest was proactively working to complete its review
- NatWest cant evidence the full time the block was in place was an avoidable delay. 
But based on what they could see, £300 is fair compensation for any delay
Mr S did not agree. It follows the matter has now been passed to me to decide.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Ive decided to uphold this complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
Banks in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their 
legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of an 
existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need to restrict, or in some 
cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
A bank is entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with a bank. 
But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which complies with the terms 
and conditions of the account.
Having looked at the information given to me by NatWest  which Im under no obligation to 
disclose - Im satisfied it was entitled to close the account in the way that it has done. In 
reaching this conclusion, I have considered this was a new account which had been opened 
for just a few days when NatWest decided to review and close it.  
NatWest told Mr S he could have the funds straight away when that wasnt the case. This no 
doubt caused inconvenience and distress. But NatWest had cause to hold onto the funds 
whilst it carried out a review. I dont, as Ive already said, need to disclose what those 
reasons were. 
NatWest has little information available to show what investigations were carried out. But 
from what little I have seen; Im satisfied it was conducting checks which Im persuaded were 
reasonable and proportionate. 
Having said that, I cant be sure if NatWest could have returned the funds sooner than it did 
at the end of May. But I do think its likely, that if anytime could have been saved, it would 
have likely been a few weeks, or little over a month. 
So given what Mr S has told us, including where his funds came from, Im satisfied 
NatWests offer to address the delays, and any distress and inconvenience this caused him, 
is fair compensation. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mr S £300 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience it has caused. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 April 2022.
