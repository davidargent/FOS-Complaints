The complaint
A company, which Ill refer to as R, complains that WorldPay Limited has unfairly charged it 
£59,646 of transaction authorisation fees. 
R is represented by one of its directors, who Ill refer to as Mr M.
What happened
R accepts card payments via its website, using WorldPay as its merchant acquirer.
On 19 August 2021, WorldPay emailed R to inform it of suspicious activity on its website. 
The company suspended its website and started investigating what had happened. It later 
discovered that its August invoice from WorldPay contained an unexpected £59,646 of 
transaction fees. 
R complained to WorldPay, which said that the charges were correct, as they related to 
some 238,000 small £0.001 card transaction attempts, which took place over 12 August 
2021 and the following days. WorldPay said these transactions fitted the pattern of an 
activity known as card testing. 
WorldPay declined to refund the 25p per transaction fee, as they said theyd done nothing 
wrong and had themselves incurred a cost. They suggested R implement security measures 
on its website. In the meantime, as Rs account was subject to net settlement, WorldPay 
stopped settling any further transactions until the outstanding fees were cleared. 
R referred its complaint to our service and one of our investigators concluded that it wouldnt 
be fair to expect WorldPay to waive the charges, as it wasnt responsible for protecting R 
against this type of activity. 
R disagreed with our investigator and asked for an ombudsman to look at things again. 
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on 11 January 2023, because I had reached a different 
conclusion from our investigator. I provisionally concluded that WorldPay should recalculate 
its fee at 4.5p per transaction rather than 25p for the fees resulting from the card testing 
activity. In my provisional decision, I said:
I think both sides agree that its likely R has been the victim of a fraudulent practice 
known as high volume card testing. This is where fraudsters attempt a large number 
of low value payments with an online merchant to check if stolen card details are 
still valid or to search for valid card numbers. Automated bots or scripts are often 
used to carry out a large amount of card testing transactions in a very short period 
of time. 
Its also not in dispute that the terms of the contract between R and WorldPay 
permit WorldPay to charge a fee per authorisation attempt, whether successful or 
not. There is no exception for card testing. I can also see that R was given due 
notice of the introduction of the 25p transaction fee and didnt object. 
There does seem to be a disagreement between the parties about who is in control 
of the front end platform that Rs clients use to input their card details on Rs 
website. R told us that it was using WorldPays hosted payment gateway. 
WorldPay says that this isnt correct and the service they provide is just a set of 
application programming interface (API) keys that plug in to their customers 
platform to communicate the transaction details to WorldPay for authorisation. I can 
see from Rs application form that it applied for the API keys, so I dont think 
WorldPay is in control of the payment gateway in this case.
If WorldPay were in control of the gateway, I think it would have given WorldPay 
greater and earlier visibility of the fraudulent transactions. It would also have meant 
they had some oversight over any protections in place to prevent fraud. In the 
absence of this, I agree with WorldPay that it wouldnt be fair to hold WorldPay 
responsible for the vulnerability of Rs website. 
I dont agree with R that WorldPay was under an obligation to alert them rapidly to 
any suspicious activity. I say this notwithstanding what any other merchant 
acquiring firms might do. I would expect such an obligation to be documented in the 
contract and I havent seen that it was in this case. Rather, the contract says (in the 
Merchant Services Agreement) that the merchant (in this case R) is solely 
responsible for establishing and applying adequate security systems and 
procedures - and the merchant is responsible for all losses resulting from any 
unauthorised activity. I think this makes it clear that WorldPay cannot be held 
responsible for attacks on the security of Rs payment arrangements. 
Having said all that, the decision for me is whether its fair and reasonable for 
WorldPay to exercise their rights under the contract (to charge a 25p transaction 
fee) in the very specific circumstances that apply in this case. 
My starting point here is that I wouldnt consider it fair for WorldPay to profit from 
this fraud. The fraudulent activity was not foreseen by either party, and I do not 
believe it would be fair for Worldpay to be enriched by it. But I do accept that 
WorldPay incur a cost in processing transactions, even rejected ones, and I would 
consider it reasonable for them to cover their costs. 
Our investigator asked WorldPay to explain why their transaction fee in this case 
was substantially higher than in other cases weve seen. WorldPay said that there 
were a number of variables in their pricing arrangements and there was 
considerable variation in how accounts functioned. In particular, WorldPay said that 
the vast majority of accounts were subject to daily settlement and invoiced monthly 
for commissions and fees. By contrast, Rs account is one of a far smaller number 
that are batch-settled, with all fees subtracted from future settlements. 
WorldPay also said that their pricing was a matter for their commercial judgement 
and hence not relevant to my considerations. I accept that there are a lot of different and overlapping variables in pricing 
merchant services contracts. But, having reviewed the evidence provided by 
WorldPay, I consider it unlikely that the marginal cost per transaction to WorldPay in 
this case is anywhere near 25p. WorldPay have currently not provided any estimate 
of how much it cost them in Rs case. Im conscious that the card testing activity in 
this case has generated exceptionally high volumes of transactions that are clearly 
very different from what WorldPay expected when they set the transaction fee. 
My current view is that the 25p fee is likely to reflect a low volume, low-profit 
account to WorldPay. I agree that this would generally be a matter for WorldPays 
commercial judgement and may be perfectly fair for R in normal trading 
circumstances. But what has happened here is clearly not normal. 
I will of course consider any evidence WorldPay choose to provide about how they 
set the level of the fee and their own costs, but my current view is that the 
incremental cost per transaction to WorldPay is substantially lower than 25p. 
Therefore, my provisional conclusion is that, whilst WorldPay are entitled to cover 
their costs, it appears that they profited from the card testing activity on Rs account, 
which is not fair. I am therefore minded to direct them to reduce their invoice to an 
amount that only covers their costs. 
I am aware that in several other cases, WorldPays transaction fee is set at 4.5p per 
transaction. WorldPay says that these are higher volume, daily-settled accounts, 
which should not be directly compared. But I dont currently have any other data on 
which to base my assessment. 
My provisional conclusion is therefore that, in the absence of evidence to indicate 
otherwise, WorldPay should recalculate their fee for R at 4.5p per transaction for 
the transactions resulting from the August 2021 card testing activity. If this results in 
a refund to R, then WorldPay must arrange to make this refund, and add interest to 
it at 8% from the date the fees were paid by R to the date of settlement. This 
interest is compensation to R for being deprived of the funds for this period. 
I fully appreciate the gravity of whats happened to Mr M. It threatens his livelihood 
and has had an impact on his mental health. I understand that this has left him 
feeling exposed and vulnerable and must seem deeply unfair, as crime so often 
does. 
However, the complainant here is R, which is a limited company. Limited 
companies cannot be distressed and I dont have the power to award compensation 
for distress suffered by a director. I do have the power to award compensation for 
inconvenience to a limited company, but I am not currently minded to do so in this 
case.
Mr M accepted my decision, which he thought was fair and well balanced. WorldPay initially 
disagreed and made a number of further points for me to consider. However, they have 
since written to me to say that, whilst they still disagree with my assessment, they now 
accept my proposed outcome. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Having done so, I havent been persuaded to change my provisional decision. Ill explain 
why that is the case below. 
First, I would like to make it clear that I agree with WorldPay that decisions concerning their 
pricing structure are solely a matter for them. My comments here should not be taken to 
refer to WorldPays general pricing strategy, nor should they be taken to mean that I think 
WorldPay did anything wrong in the way it set the pricing for Rs contract. My conclusion is 
simply that, in these very specific circumstances, where a high volume card testing attack 
out of the blue has coincided with a contract that loads much of the cost onto a high 
transaction fee, it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for WorldPay to charge R the full amount of 
the fee. 
It may well be true that in normal circumstances, where no fraud has occurred, WorldPay 
would not make a great deal of profit on Rs authorisation fee, bearing in mind that this fee 
may also cover other costs beyond simply authorisation. But WorldPay was happy to do 
business with R before the events of this complaint, so I think it is reasonable to conclude 
that they were making a profit they were satisfied with before the arrival of an unexpected 
card testing windfall. 
As I set out in my provisional decision, I dont consider what has happened here can be 
considered normal activity between R and WorldPay. Rs contract was set up anticipating 
low transaction volumes and the transaction fee agreed by R and WorldPay reflected that. 
Although the wording of the contract did envisage the possibility of some form of security 
breach, I dont believe the nature of this actual fraudulent event and the impact it would have 
on this pricing structure was foreseen. 
WorldPay has said that the pricing structure in this individual case loads most of the costs 
onto the authorisation fee. I think this meant that the card testing attack resulted in a 
disproportionately high charge to R. I do not think it likely that this exceptional fee was built 
into any of WorldPays calculations when they set their pricing structure for this product. If 
paid, in my view, it would therefore result in WorldPay being unfairly enriched by the 
fraudulent activity suffered by R.  
It seems to me that this is a case of exceptional circumstances, which it is therefore fair and 
reasonable for WorldPay to reflect and reduce the transaction fee charged. Im mindful here 
that as a regulated firm carrying on a regulated activity, WorldPay must comply with the 
Principles for firms set out by the Financial Conduct Authority. Principle 6 is A firm must pay 
due regard to the interest of its customers and treat them fairly. Im not persuaded that 
WorldPay would be treating their customer fairly, if they didnt reconsider the charges in the 
light of this exceptional event. 
In deciding what would be a fair and reasonable outcome in this case, I need to be mindful 
that the fraudulent card testing wasnt WorldPays fault, so it would be unfair for WorldPay to 
be out of pocket as a result. In other words, I dont think they should profit from these 
unfortunate circumstances, but neither do I think they should lose out. 
WorldPay have argued that it isnt possible for them to provide evidence of their costs, 
because they arent charged by the card providers in a way that separates their customers. I 
accept this is a difficulty. However, where I determine a complaint in favour of the 
complainant, section 229 of the Financial Services and Markets Act allows me to make an 
award against the respondent of such amount as I consider fair compensation for loss or 
damage. For completeness, section 229 also allows me to include a direction that the 
respondent take such steps in relation to the complainant as I consider just and appropriate. I dont dispute that my proposal here was to apply a transaction price from a different 
product, involving different cost considerations and a different customer base. I took the view 
that it was better to apply pricing that I know WorldPay uses elsewhere than to come up with 
something entirely new. On balance, and in the absence of any other evidence or 
submissions from WorldPay on which to base a figure, I still think this is the fairest option. I 
think its unlikely that this pricing would leave WorldPay making a loss. I say this partly 
because Im aware of other cases where WorldPay has charged a much lower fee than 4.5p. 
In summary, for the reasons set out above, I have concluded that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable for WorldPay to charge R the full 25p per transaction set out in their contract in 
the specific circumstances that have happened here. In the absence of any submissions 
from WorldPay on their costs in this case, I consider that 4.5p per transaction is a fair 
amount to charge in these circumstances. 
Putting things right
WorldPay should recalculate its fee for R at 4.5p per transaction for the transactions 
resulting from the August 2021 card testing activity and provide R with a new invoice. 
From the evidence Ive seen, I think its unlikely that this will result in a refund to R. But if it 
does, then WorldPay must arrange to make this refund and add interest to the amount of the 
refund at 8% from the date the fees were paid by R to the date of settlement. This interest is 
intended to compensate R for being deprived of the funds for this period. If, following this 
recalculation, R still owes WorldPay an amount, then no interest will be payable by 
WorldPay. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct WorldPay Limited to take the actions set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask R to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 August 2023.
