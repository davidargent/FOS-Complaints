The complaint
Ms K complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) declined her requests to 
withdraw £10,000 in cash. Ms K also complains about the service provided by NatWest in 
branch. 
What happened
In February 2022 Ms K attended a branch of NatWest with the intention of withdrawing 
£10,000 in cash. NatWest has explained it has a process to help protect customers that 
means when a large cash withdrawal request is received, it asks questions and requests 
evidence to show what the funds are for. 
NatWest says Ms K advised she intended to use £300 to buy a fridge and the remaining 
funds to pay off relatives. NatWest says it asked Ms K for evidence to show the funds were 
legitimately required to check whether shed been the victim of fraud. But when Ms K didnt 
supply the information NatWest asked for, it declined the withdrawal. 
Ms Ks told us she made three requests to withdraw £10,000 in cash in branch but all were 
declined. Ms K says she had to wait around three hours in branch for service and that staff 
members were aggressive and rude when dealing with her withdrawal requests. 
Ms K complained and NatWest issued a final response on 26 March 2023. NatWest advised 
that no error had been made when declining the withdrawal requests and said it had acted in 
line with the accounts terms and conditions. But NatWest agreed the service Ms K received 
in branch shouldve been better, apologised and paid her £250 for the inconvenience 
caused. 
An investigator at this service looked at Ms Ks complaint. They thought NatWest had acted 
reasonably by declining Ms Ks withdrawal requests. The investigator agreed that the service 
provided in branch was poor at times but thought the award of £250 for the distress and 
inconvenience caused was a fair way to resolve Ms Ks complaint. Ms K didnt accept the 
investigators view so her complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Ms K was upset that NatWest declined her withdrawal requests. As 
Ms K told NatWest, the funds in her account belonged to her. And I appreciate that Ms K 
wanted to use her money which is why she requested cash withdrawals of £10,000. But, I 
have to take both parties points into account when considering whether a business has 
acted fairly or not. And my view is that NatWest makes a reasonable point when it says its 
obliged to protect customers from fraud. 
NatWest has supplied evidence to show its standard approach for large cash withdrawals. 
The guidance shows that when a large cash withdrawal request is made NatWest has to 
complete a customer protection check. That involves asking targeted questions about the 
reason for the withdrawal and asking for evidence to show what the funds were intended for. 
I understand that on each occasion Ms K attempted to make the withdrawal she was asked 
questions and for evidence by branch staff. But whilst branch staff recorded Ms K intended 
to spend £300 on a new fridge and said the remaining funds were intended to repay family, 
no evidence to support that was supplied. 
NatWest has pointed to section 2.2 of Ms Ks account terms and conditions which say We 
will always follow your instructions unless we reasonably suspect your instruction is 
connected to a scam, fraud or any  other crime, or we reasonably consider that your 
instruction is of a type where there is a high risk of there being such a connection. I 
appreciate Ms K has told us that the transaction was entirely genuine. But Im satisfied 
NatWest needed to be sure that Ms K wasnt the victim of a scam and was seeking to 
protect her account and funds when asking for further information in relation to the 
withdrawal. Im sorry to disappoint Ms K but Im satisfied NatWest had genuine concerns and 
reasonably asked her to provide more information and supporting evidence before agreeing 
to approve the withdrawal request. And Im satisfied NatWest followed the account terms 
and conditions when taking the decision to decline Ms Ks requests. 
Ms Ks told us she visited the branch on three occasions and had to wait for around three 
hours for service. I also understand Ms K found staff to be rude and aggressive when 
dealing with her. Our investigator asked NatWest to supply a statement from branch staff 
concerning Ms Ks visits. Branch staff have confirmed they recall Ms Ks visits and requests 
to withdraw £10,000 in cash. But branch have explained that as Ms K didnt answer the 
questions asked, they werent able to approve the withdrawal. I dont doubt that Ms K was 
frustrated by her experience in branch and the long delays she experienced. I agree that the 
service Ms K was given shouldve been better. And it shouldnt have taken a three hour wait 
for NatWest to advise whether it as possible to complete the withdrawal or not. 
In its final response, NatWest apologised for the service provided in branch and offered Ms 
K £250 for the distress and inconvenience caused. In my view, a settlement of £250 fairly 
reflects how Ms Ks branch visits were handled and the trouble and upset caused. To put it 
another way, NatWests settlement is very much in line with what I wouldve told it to pay, 
had no offer been made already. Im very sorry to disappoint Ms K, but as Im satisfied 
NatWest didnt make an error by declining her withdrawal requests and has already agreed a 
settlement that is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances Im not telling it to do anything 
else.
 
My final decision
My decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc has already agreed a settlement that is 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 November 2023.
