The complaint
Mr T complains that Mitsubishi HC Capital UK plc, trading as Hitachi Capital, wont refund to 
him the money that he paid for a holiday club membership. Hes being represented in his 
complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr T and his wife signed an upgrade agreement in September 2015 to upgrade their holiday 
club membership. The purchase price of the upgrade was £10,118 and Mr T entered into a 
fixed sum loan agreement with Hitachi Capital, that he signed in September 2015, for a loan 
of that amount. He agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £146.29 to Hitachi Capital.
Mr T and his wife complained to Hitachi Capital in May 2020 that they hadnt been provided 
with pre-contract credit information and that the loan hadnt been explained to them. They 
said that this was an example of the unfair relationship between them and was a breach of 
contract. Hitachi Capital said that pre-contract credit information was signed by Mr T and that 
the holiday company went through all of the contractual documentation with him and his 
wife.
Mr Ts representative made a detailed complaint to this service, on behalf of Mr T, in 
February 2021 about the sales process and other issues, including that Mr T didnt recall 
receiving the pre-contract credit information, if the holiday company was authorised to act as 
a credit broker it had breached its authorisation, the membership had been misrepresented 
to Mr T and his wife, there was no evidence that a credit check was conducted prior to the 
loan being granted and the high interest rate was an indication of an unfair relationship. 
Hitachi Capital said that it had responded to Mr Ts complaint in August 2020 and that its 
stance remained unchanged so it wouldnt be upholding his complaint.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ts complaint should be upheld. He wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and he didnt think that the 
contractual terms were so problematic as to be unfair or that Mr T had agreed to the 
purchase without knowing something that was important to that decision or that Hitachi 
Capitals conduct fell so short of the standard that could have been reasonably expected that 
it made its relationship with Mr T unfair. He didnt think that it was likely that any commission 
was paid to the holiday company by Hitachi Capital and he said that he hadnt seen anything 
persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr T.
Mr Ts representative has asked, on his behalf, for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, that 
the membership was misrepresented to Mr T and his wife, there was an unfair relationship 
between Hitachi Capital and Mr T and that Hitachi Capital was required to conduct an 
assessment of the affordability of the loan for Mr T.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr T paid for the upgrade to his and his wifes membership using credit provided by 
Hitachi Capital and his representative has made claims to Hitachi Capital, on his 
behalf, under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ts claims under sections 75 and 140A as only 
a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Hitachi Capitals 
response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr Ts representative says that Mr T and his wife entered into a trial membership 
agreement with the holiday company in September 2014 but I understand that they 
paid the purchase price for that membership by credit card and didnt pay for it using 
credit provided by Hitachi Capital so I dont consider that Hitachi Capital has any 
liability to them for any issues with that agreement;
Mr T and his wife signed the upgrade agreement and the holiday companys terms 
and conditions in September 2015 - they also signed a separate standard 
withdrawal form to acknowledge receipt of that information, a key information 
document, a membership application form and a compliance statement  they also 
signed documents relating to their membership of an exchange programme;
Mr T also signed the loan agreement with Hitachi Capital which included his right to 
withdraw from the loan agreement and an adequate explanation declaration;
Hitachi Capital has provided a copy of the pre-contract credit information that was 
prepared for Mr T and he signed the adequate explanation document which said that 
he would receive the pre-contract credit information  Hitachi Capital says that the 
holiday company went through all of the contractual documentation with Mr T and his 
wife  Ive not seen a signed copy of the pre-contract credit information but I consider 
it to be more likely than not that the information was provided to Mr T even though he 
doesnt recall receiving it;
Mr Ts representative says that the membership was misrepresented to Mr T and his 
wife and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them - 
the latest time that any such misrepresentations could have been made to them was 
in September 2015 as that was when they entered into the upgrade agreement and 
Mr T entered into the loan agreement, but Mr T didnt complain to Hitachi Capital until 
May 2020 and he didnt refer at that time to any misrepresentations by the holiday 
company  the first claim about the alleged misrepresentations was in his 
representatives complaint to this service in February 2021, more than five years after 
hed entered into the agreements, and I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect him to have complained about any misrepresentations before then and to 
have referred to them in his complaint to Hitachi Capital in May 2020;
the terms and conditions that Mr T and his wife signed say, if you have relied on 
verbal promises please ask for these to be put in writing and the compliance 
statement that they signed says: We understand that this document, the Purchase 
Agreement and the documents referred to in it form the entire agreement between the parties. We confirm that no oral or written representations have been made to us 
upon which we have relied and which are either not contained in the documentation 
presented to us today or noted by us below in the comments box - Ive seen no 
evidence to show that Mr T or his wife asked for any information on which theyd 
relied to be confirmed in writing;
Mr T and his wife were able to use their membership and the holiday company has 
described the holidays for which they used their membership in 2016 and 2017  and 
it says that they also made a cash booking in 2018 as theyd not paid their annual 
management fees for 2018 so couldnt use their points  Ive seen no evidence to 
show that they complained about any misrepresentations by the holiday company at 
that time;
I understand that Mr T and his wife havent paid the annual management fees since 
2018 so havent been able to use their membership  but I consider that their liability 
for the management fee was described and accepted in the documents that theyd 
signed;
Im not persuaded that Mr T has provided enough evidence to show that the 
membership was misrepresented to him and his wife by the holiday company before 
they entered into the upgrade agreement;
Mr Ts representative has described the way that the membership was sold to Mr T 
and his wife but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they 
were unduly pressured into entering into the upgrade agreement or that Mr T was 
unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement in September 2015 or that the 
holiday company used unacceptable commercial practices against them;
the compliance statement that Mr T and his wife signed said: We confirm that we 
have been treated courteously during the sales presentation, that we have been 
given plenty of time to consider if the product is right for us and we have not been put 
under any pressure to purchase our points  I consider that it would be reasonable 
to expect them not to have signed the compliance statement if they felt that theyd 
been unduly pressured into signing the agreements or if they had any issues with the 
sales process that the holiday company had used;
Mr T and his wife signed a separate standard withdrawal form which set out their 
right to withdraw from the upgrade agreement and said: The consumer has the right 
to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason;
the loan agreement also clearly set out Mr Ts right to withdraw from the loan 
agreement without giving any reason within 14 days  he signed the loan agreement 
and immediately above his signatures it says: This is a Credit Agreement regulated 
by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be legally bound by its 
terms;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr T or his wife tried to withdraw from the 
upgrade agreement or that Mr T tried to withdraw from the loan agreement during the 
withdrawal periods;
Mr Ts representative says that the high interest rate that Mr T was expected to pay is 
an indication of an unfair relationship  but Mr T signed the loan agreement which 
clearly set out the annual rate of interest (and the APR), the amount of credit, the 
total charge for credit and the number and amount of the monthly repayments  and 
the monthly repayments and the interest rate were also referred to in other 
documents  if the interest rate wasnt acceptable to Mr T I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him not to have signed the loan agreement;
Mr T and his wife confirmed in the compliance statement that they had read the purchase agreement and key information document, together with the loan 
agreement and were happy to proceed with the purchase;
Mr Ts representative says that if the holiday company was authorised to act as a 
credit broker it has breached its authorisation  Hitachi Capital says that the holiday 
company was authorised to act as a credit broker and Im not persuaded that Mr Ts 
representative has provided enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
acted as an unauthorised broker in arranging the loan to Mr T or that it breached its 
authorisation;
Mr Ts representative also says that no credit checks were carried out by Hitachi 
Capital before the loan was made to Mr T  but Hitachi Capital has provided 
evidence to show that the affordability of the loan for Mr T was assessed and that 
information was obtained about his employment, property ownership and income 
which showed that he could afford a loan with monthly repayments of £146.29  and 
Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr T;
the compliance statement said that the holiday company didnt receive any 
commission in respect of credit brokered and Ive seen no evidence to show that 
Hitachi Capital paid a commission to the holiday company;
Im not persuaded that Mr T has provided enough evidence to show that his 
relationship with Hitachi Capital was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr T and Hitachi 
Capital in these circumstances;
I consider that it was fair and reasonable for Hitachi Capital to say that it didnt uphold 
Mr Ts complaint; and
I sympathise with Mr T and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their 
membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Hitachi 
Capital to refund to them any of the money that theyve paid under the loan 
agreement, to pay them any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 January 2023.
