The complaint
Mr M says Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) lent to him irresponsibly.  
What happened
Mr M took out three instalment loans from 118 118 Money. A summary of his borrowing
follows.
Mr M says he had a number of pressing debts when he applied, and it was very easy to get
the loans. He says if the lender had asked for supporting documentation, like his bank
statements, it would have seen what a mess he was in.
Our investigator didnt recommend Mr Ms complaint should be upheld. He said the checks
were proportionate and it seemed the loans were affordable for Mr M.
Mr M disagreed. His representative pointed to his credit accounts that had been in arrears, a
defaulted loan account and his Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) as evidence that
loans 2 and 3 were lent irresponsibly.
As agreement wasnt reached the complaint was passed to me to make a decision. I 
reached a different conclusion to the investigator, so I issued a provisional decision. An 
extract follows and forms part of this final decision. I asked both parties to send me any new 
comments or information by 8 December 2021.
Extract from my provisional decision
I can see 118 118 Money asked for some information from Mr M before it approved the
loans. It asked for his monthly income and expenditure. It says it completed income
verification with a third party but hasnt made clear if this changed the income figures it used
in its affordability assessments. Each time, it checked Mr Ms credit file to understand his
existing monthly credit commitments and credit history. From these checks combined 118
118 Money concluded Mr M had sufficient disposable income to afford each of the loans.
Our investigator found 118 118 Money wasnt wrong to lend to Mr M. I have, in places,
reached a different conclusion. Ill explain why.
Loan 1
I think the checks 118 118 Money carried out were proportionate given the size and term of
the loan, and the age of the lending relationship. But I dont think 118 118 Money made a fair
lending decision based on the information it gathered. Mr M declared an income of £1,375
and living costs of £505, including his mortgage. He declared his existing credit
commitments were £279 a month. 118 118 Money could see his unsecured commitments
were £419 based on the credit commitments it saw on his credit report, assuming he made a
minimum payment of 3% on his credit card balance of £5,531, plus the loan repayment of
£254.
So in giving the loan 118 118 Money was increasing Mr Ms monthly unsecured credit
commitments to £533  a significant proportion of Mr Ms monthly income. I think 118 118
Money ought to have realised this meant there was a risk the repayments would not be
sustainably affordable for Mr M. The fact he made all his repayments does not alter this
finding as we do not know how Mr M managed to do so.
From its credit check the lender could see Mr M had nine active credit accounts and around
£17,469 of unsecured debt. He had withdrawn £3,310 in cash on credit in the last 12
months, often an indicator of financial stress. He had also taken out four payday loans (one
was still active) in the two months prior to this application. From this information I think 118
118 Money should have been concerned Mr M was already having problems managing his
money. And so further increasing his monthly credit commitments was likely to cause
adverse financial consequences for him. And it needed to consider this, not just the pounds
and pence affordability.
It follows I think 118 118 Money was wrong to give Mr M loan 1.
Loan 2
Mr M applied for loan 2 over four years later. Given the term and value of both the loan and
its monthly repayments, I think the checks 118 118 Money carried out for loan 2 were
proportionate. Mr M declared an income of £2,141, living expenses (including his mortgage)
of £683.35 and credit commitments of £51. The lenders credit check showed his financial
situation had improved significantly since loan 1. His overall unsecured indebtedness was
now £1,015 and his associated monthly credit commitments - whilst marginally higher than
the level he declared - were around £75.
I note the check showed Mr M had defaulted on a loan in early 2017, but this debt had been
cleared by March 2019. And there were two credit card accounts that had been in arrears
from 2017 to mid-2018 but they were then repaid under a debt management plan and settled 
by January 2019. I think it was reasonable for 118 118 Money to consider this adverse
information as historic and not a reason to decline Mr Ms application.
In response to the investigators assessment Mr Ms representative pointed out that Mr M
entered into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) in June 2017 that he was discharged
from in February 2019. I cant see that 118 118 Money would have been aware of this from
the results of the credit check it carried out. A lender will often not see the same information
as a borrower would on their full credit file: there can be timing differences and not all
lenders to report to all credit reference agencies. I can see from the full credit report Mr M
has supplied that only one of the four agencies returned information in the insolvency
section. And I can only fairly expect 118 118 Money to react to the information returned on
the check it completed.
Overall, I think 118 118 Money made a fair lending decision based on the information it
gathered for loan 2. It follows I dont think 118 118 Money was wrong to give loan 2 to Mr M.
Loan 3
Mr M declared income of £1,650, living expenses of £484 (including his mortgage) and creditcommitments of £250. From this the lender concluded the loan would be affordable. But as
at the time of loan 1, I dont think 118 118 Money made a fair lending decision based on the
information it gathered. From the credit check it completed it knew Mr M had two secured
loans with combined monthly repayments of £54, a revolving line of credit with a monthly
repayment of £39, a loan (that he was overdue on) with a monthly repayment of £251 and a
credit card requiring a minimum payment of £19. Approving this loan took his total
monthly credit commitments (excluding his mortgage) to £594.60.
This was a significant percentage of Mr Ms declared income and as a result I think 118 118
Money ought to have realised Mr M was unlikely to be able to sustainable repay the loan
over its 18-month term. Whilst he had repaid loan 2 early, it could see from the credit check
for this loan that he had taken out another loan on the same date suggesting he had
borrowed to repay. Overall, I think it ought to have realised there was a high risk this loan
would not be sustainably affordable for Mr M.
It follows I think 118 118 Money was wrong to give loan 3 to Mr M.
I havent found any evidence that 118 118 Money acted unfairly or unreasonably in some
other way. Mr M referenced a data breach that the lender notified him about but hasnt
provided any more detail or supporting evidence. So I cant comment on this - if he wishes to
send in more detail I may be able to investigate before issuing my final decision. However, if
it is something he has not complained to the lender about, he would need to first do so
before we can consider it.
I then set out what 118 118 Money would have to do if I upheld Mr Ms complaint about 
loans 1 and 3.
Both parties responded accepting my provisional decision. Mr M did not provide any further 
information about the data breach he referenced previously.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to unaffordable/irresponsible lending complaints is set out on our website and
Ive followed it here.
As neither party sent in new comments or information I have no reason to depart from the 
findings or outcome I set out in my provisional decision. 
It follows I think 118 118 Money was wrong to give loans 1 and 3 to Mr M. 
Putting things right
I think its fair and reasonable for Mr M to repay the capital that he borrowed as part of
loans 1 and 3 because he had the benefit of that money. But he has paid interest and
charges on these loans that shouldnt have been provided to him.
118 118 Money must now:
For loans 1 and 3 refund all interest and charges  so add up the total amount Mr M
repaid for each loan and deduct the sum from the capital amount of the respective
loan.
If this results in him having effectively made payments above the original capitalborrowed, then 118 118 Money should refund these overpayments with 8% simple
interest calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have
arisen, to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ms credit file in relation to loans 1
and 3.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to deduct tax from this interest. 118 118 Money
should give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its deducted if he asks for one.  
My final decision
I am upholding Mr Ms complaint about loans 1 and 3. Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 
118 118 Money) must put things right as set out above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 January 2022.
