The complaint
Miss L complains that Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) was irresponsible to lend 
to her.
What happened
Miss L had 24 loans from Lending Stream between March 2016 and September 2019. The 
first ten loans were as follows:

* Including overlapping loans
Miss L says the loans were unaffordable and she had to borrow further to make repayments. 
She says she became trapped in a debt spiral and suffered financial hardship as a result.
Lending Stream says it asked Miss L about her income and expenditure and sanity-checked 
the information with independent data sources. It says it adjusted Miss Ls declared 
expenditure upwards where necessary before assessing the loan applications. Lending 
Stream says it was satisfied all the loans were affordable based upon the available 
information. However, it offered to discuss an affordable payment arrangement with Miss L.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld in part. He said that Miss Ls 
pattern of borrowing showed she had become persistently reliant on short-term lending by 
loan 6. He recommended that interest and charges should be refunded on loans 6 to 24 
(plus 8% statutory interest) and that these loans should be removed from her credit file.
Lending Stream did not respond to the adjudicators recommendation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure 
Miss L could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether Miss L could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ls complaint.
Loans 1 to 5
Im not satisfied that Lending Stream did enough checks for some of the later loans in this 
chain, but based on the available information, I cant see there was anything that should 
have indicated to Lending Stream that any of these loans were unaffordable. So I cant 
conclude Lending Stream was wrong to approve Miss Ls first five loans.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Lending Streams lending history with Miss L, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Lending Stream should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ls case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:By this stage, Miss L had consistently had multiple loans outstanding at the time of 
each loan application;
The term of loan 6 meant that Miss L would have been in debt to Lending Stream for 
over 15 months. As the purpose of these high-cost loans is to address a short-term 
cashflow issue, I consider Lending Stream should have realised she was not using 
the loans for their intended purpose;
From loan 6 onwards Miss L was provided with a new loan within days of settling a 
previous one. So Lending Stream ought to have realised it was more likely than not 
Miss L was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances and that Miss Ls indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
Miss L wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Lending Stream. 
Loan 24 was taken out three-and-a-half years after Miss Ls first. Miss L had paid 
large amounts of interest to service a debt to Lending Stream over a long period.
I think Miss L lost out because Lending Stream continued to provide borrowing from loan 6:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ls indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period;
the sheer number of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Miss Ls ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding Miss Ls complaint about loans 6 to 24.
My final decision
My decision is that Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Miss L paid on loans 6 to 24;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on refunds from payment date to settlement date*;
Write off any unpaid interest and charges for the outstanding loans, apply the refund 
to reduce any capital outstanding and pay any balance to Miss L; 
The number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 to 24 should be removed from 
Miss Ls credit file once theyve been repaid.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Miss L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
If Lending Stream intends to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it 
must do so after deducting the tax.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss L to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 October 2020.
