The complaint
A company, which Ill refer to as T, complains about the handling by National Westminster 
Bank Plc (NatWest) of its access to foreign exchange trading services.
Mr H, the director of T, brings the complaint on T's behalf.
What happened
In March 2020, T asked NatWest to reinstate its access to NatWests foreign exchange 
trading service. T said that it had previously had a good relationship with NatWest FX 
Services, and had been a customer of the bank for many years.
In July 2020, having seen no progress, T complained to NatWest. 
NatWest told T that, due to the requirements on banks to ringfence certain activities, it was 
no longer able to provide T with its former service. NatWest said that T would have to 
become a new customer of NatWest Markets (a non-ringfenced bank) for this kind of 
service. 
Over the following months, T followed up its complaint with further correspondence to 
various NatWest staff members, including NatWests CEO.
In late July 2020, NatWest told T that it was envisaged the new onboarding process would 
go live in about a month. However, the process took much longer. 
In September 2020, NatWest said that, while it would have liked to enable T to transact with 
NatWest Markets, this wasnt currently possible. It said there were temporary issues 
following regulatory guidance, which meant NatWest Markets wouldnt yet start the 
onboarding process.
Although T contacted both NatWest and NatWest Markets several times, the issue remained 
unresolved. 
Mr H brought Ts complaint to our service. Finally, in June 2021, NatWest confirmed that 
NatWest Markets could now begin onboarding T to its service.
Our investigator considered Ts complaint but said that, in her view, NatWest had acted 
reasonably in explaining why it was unable to provide the foreign exchange services it had 
previously provided to T. She said that any issue with how NatWest Markets had onboarded 
T, and how long this process had taken, would need to be raised in a separate complaint 
about NatWest Markets. However, she said that NatWest could have done more to manage 
Ts expectations about the length of time the onboarding process at NatWest Markets might 
take. She also said that T had suffered some inconvenience from having to chase the matter 
with NatWest. For these reasons, she said NatWest should pay T £250.
In response to this view, Mr H provided various comments and questions to which our 
investigator responded. To the extent these comments are relevant to my decision, they are 
addressed below.
As Mr H didnt agree with the view of our investigator, he asked for an ombudsmans 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
While I have read carefully the full correspondence between T and NatWest and considered 
all the evidence submitted, I have focussed my decision on the matters which I consider 
central to this complaint. 
I am unable to consider Ts experience of NatWest Markets, which is a different entity to 
NatWest. Rather, in this complaint, I have considered the behaviour of NatWest in its 
dealings with T. There are two key issues:
Should NatWest have done more to provide the services T was seeking?
Was NatWest clear and timely in its communication with T about the foreign 
exchange services T was seeking?
I consider each in turn.
Should NatWest have done more to provide the services T was seeking
The ring-fencing of certain banking services was a requirement which obliged NatWest to 
restructure many of its activities. NatWest has explained that it was in response to these 
requirements that it moved its foreign exchange services for customers including T from 
NatWest to NatWest Markets, a separate legal entity. Given these changes in response to 
Government requirements, I believe it is reasonable that NatWest was unable to provide T 
with the foreign exchange services it was seeking, even though NatWest had previously 
provided T with those services. 
I understand that T believes that its inability to access foreign exchange services caused it to 
suffer a financial loss. However, given that I do not believe NatWest acted unreasonably in 
ceasing to provide these services, and given I cannot consider the behaviour of NatWest 
Markets within this complaint, there is no basis to compensate for these missed 
opportunities.
Communication between NatWest and T
T approached NatWest in March 2020 to reinstate its access to NatWests foreign exchange 
trading service. However, it appears that it wasnt until July 2020 that NatWest explained to 
T that this service would now need to be provided by NatWest Markets.
In July 2020, NatWest explained to T that, to be onboarded to NatWest Markets, T would 
have to go through various checks. T was frustrated by this process as it had been a 
customer of NatWest for many years. However, NatWest was simply communicating the 
process being adopted by NatWest Markets. As mentioned above, any concerns about the 
behaviour of NatWest Markets in welcoming and onboarding T is beyond the scope of this current complaint. Therefore, I am not going to comment on the appropriateness or 
otherwise of the checks employed by NatWest Markets.
Also in July 2020, NatWest explained to T that NatWest Markets was addressing certain 
ongoing regulatory issues in its onboarding. NatWest told T that NatWest Markets hoped to 
have this resolved in about a month. 
At the end of July 2020, NatWest told T that it couldnt confirm when the issues at NatWest 
Markets would be resolved, and it invited T to consider approaching another provider for 
foreign exchange services.
In early September 2020, NatWest informed T that the ongoing regulatory issues had still not 
been resolved, and that it was unable to provide a timeframe in which they would be 
resolved. 
In late September, NatWest indicated the issues might be resolved by mid-October. But in 
late October, NatWest said it was likely to be in the first quarter of 2021.
Only in June 2021 did NatWest explain that NatWest Markets had resolved the issues and 
was now able to begin onboarding T to its service.
Overall, it clearly took NatWest Markets a long time to make its foreign exchange services 
available to T, and this caused Mr H substantial frustration. However, it is not clear that 
NatWest could have anticipated the length of this process. It appears that, from July 2020 
onwards, NatWest responded in a timely way to T and kept it informed, as much as it could, 
of the status of the issues at NatWest Markets. Although the timetable given proved wrong at 
various points, I cannot fairly hold NatWest responsible when the delays were due to the 
actions of NatWest Markets. 
I note that in July 2020, soon after it became clear that NatWest Markets was not going to 
onboard T quickly, NatWest said to T that it might wish to approach another provider. I 
acknowledge that T didnt want to approach a new provider given its long relationship with 
NatWest and because it didnt want to go through the new customer checks, but NatWest 
had already explained to T that similar checks would apply in becoming a new customer of 
NatWest Markets.
Therefore, from July 2020 onwards, while I acknowledge Mr Hs frustration at not being able 
to access the services he wanted, I do not believe NatWest did anything wrong. 
Where I believe NatWest could have done better is in its initial response to T. In March 2020, 
NatWest could have been clearer about its inability to provide the foreign exchange services 
T had previously used, and it could have set out more clearly the need for T to be set up as 
a new customer of NatWest Markets to access similar services, and what that process might 
entail. However, at that time, NatWest would not have been able to give a reliable timeframe 
for how quickly NatWest Markets might onboard T. 
Overall, I believe the payment to T of £250 by NatWest, as proposed by our investigator, is 
appropriate to put things right.
In the course of its complaint, T also contacted the CEO of NatWest and did not receive a 
response. However, given that NatWest was in regular contact with T, I do not think it 
unreasonable that the CEO didnt also respond.
I know Mr H will be very disappointed by this outcome given the long period in which he was 
unable to gain access to financial exchange services, whether from NatWest or NatWest Markets, and given the inaccurate information on how long the process might take for his 
business to onboard with NatWest Markets. However, for the reasons set out above, I 
believe the mistakes made by NatWest were limited in the circumstances, and I cannot 
consider the actions of NatWest Markets.
My final decision
I require National Westminster Bank Plc to pay T £250.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask T to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 May 2022.
