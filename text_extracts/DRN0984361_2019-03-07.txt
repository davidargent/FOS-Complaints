K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt pay him an account  reward as 
advertised and that he was told the advert hed received about the offer was potentially 
fraudulent. 
Mr M also complains  about delays from NatWest when paying compensations. 
background
Mr M holds  a NatWest bank account and received details of a NatWest promotion that 
meant he was eligible  for a reward. But despite  meeting the terms, the reward  wasnt paid by 
NatWest so Mr M got in touch. 
When Mr M spoke  with NatWest he was incorrectly told the offer was a scam and was 
promised a call back. But that didnt happen and when Mr M spoke with NatWest again it 
confirmed the same information. After Mr M complained NatWest went on to pay him £10, 
confirmed there was no scam and offered an additional £20. 
There were delays in paying  the settlement to Mr M and as a result NatWest offered Mr M a 
total of £70 to apologise.  Mr M doesnt feel the offer goes  far enough  as there were some 
further delays  paying the settlement.  Mr M referred his complaint to this service and an 
adjudicator looked at what had happened. They agreed Mr M had been  given  incorrect 
information and that there  were delays crediting his account but thought the existing offer 
was fair. Mr M didnt agree so his complaints been passed to me to make a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
All parties  to this case  broadly  agree  about  what happened so Ive been brief when setting  
out the background. In Mr Ms most  recent emails to this service  hes told us he doesnt  feel 
NatWests offer is fair as it doesnt  factor  in additional delays he experienced receiving the 
settlement. I appreciate  where Mr M is coming  from but as the adjudicators explained, we 
dont fine or punish  businesses  for making errors.  In this case, Im considering  whether the 
£70 compensation  NatWest has paid is fair in relation to everything Mr Ms raised.
Mr Ms told us that he spent several hours  dealing with the issues that arose  from being  
given incorrect information  by NatWest. I can see hes had to make  some calls and had to 
chase NatWest up to ensure it paid him as agreed. And I agree there were delays paying the 
agreed settlement.  But even taking those points into account, Im satisfied the £70 NatWest  
has paid fairly reflects  the impact  of its errors  on Mr M. 
I agree  that there was some inconvenience  to Mr M in this case but Ive not found  the 
situation caused him to spend  an unreasonable amount  of time that isnt reflected in what 
NatWests paid. 
As Im satisfied the settlement NatWests paid of £70 is fair in all the circumstances Im not 
telling it to increase  the offer or take any further action to resolve this complaint.

My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint  beyond the settlement  
National Westminster Bank Plc has already paid. Under the rules  of the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or reject my decision 
before 7 April 2019.
