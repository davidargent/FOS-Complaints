K820x#14complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) did not transfer all his direct  
debit payments when  using  their current account switching service.
background
Mr A asked NatWest to switch his current account from his previous bank to them  using their 
online switching service.
NatWest arranged to switch Mr As current account shortly after, moving all his direct  debit  
payments to his NatWest  account. Mr A spoke to NatWest next day to clarify  some points 
and was assured  that his existing direct  debit payments were being amended as planned. 
On the day of the switch Mr As existing account balance was moved over to his new 
account. Mr A says he checked his online account which  only showed two of his direct  debit 
payments. Mr A waited  a few days before contacting each of the companies with whom  he 
had a direct  debit. Mr A says that most of these businesses informed him that they had not 
received any instructions  to change his bank  details. Mr A asked for the direct  debits  to be 
amended manually to his new account as he was concerned the payments would be missed.
Mr A then made  a complaint to NatWest saying that he was not happy with the service  he 
received as he believed that most  of his direct debit payments had not been switched over to 
his new account.  Mr A asked for an explanation of what had gone  on and for compensation.
In response to Mr As complaint NatWest  said that all the direct  debit mandates  were set up 
two days before the switching date. They said Mr A was informed on this date that the 
payments had been moved and then again on the day the account  was switched over. 
NatWest said they do not believe that any error  had occurred.
Mr A was not happy with NatWests response and so brought his complaint to us. 
NatWest provided evidence to our investigator that they had instructed the amendments to 
the direct  debit mandates before the date of the switch  and could not see that an error 
had occurred. In response,  Mr A provided  the investigator with letters from some  of the 
companies involved saying that after the date of the switch  they still had Mr As old bank 
details for payments. 
Our investigator was satisfied that NatWest had provided enough evidence to show  that they 
had informed each  of the companies involved before the account was switched. 
Their opinion was that NatWest had not done anything  wrong.  Mr A disagreed so the matter 
has been passed onto me for a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest told Mr A that all his direct debit  payments would be moved  to his new account as 
part of the switching service. Mr A was kept up to date with the progress of the switch and 
the balance of his old account  was moved over on the correct  date. 
Ref: DRN46257052Looking at the information provided by NatWest I am satisfied that they did send instructions 
to amend the direct debits for all the companies  involved. They have  provided  screenshots  
of this process which show that NatWest did provide the information to the direct  debit 
providers as they were  required  to do so and within the timeframe of the switch.
Mr A understands that the direct debit payments would not have shown up on his online 
banking until after the first payment had been made.  I do believe that this is what made Mr A 
check his direct debits with the companies  in the following days  and amend them manually. 
I can see why Mr A did this, to ensure that the payments were not missed, however  he did 
this of his own accord without speaking to NatWest first. 
I have read through the letters provided  by Mr A from the companies  with whom he has 
direct debits. I can see why Mr A believes NatWest did not send instructions to change  his 
direct debits to some  the businesses involved.  Most of these letters  confirm  that Mr A 
manually changed  the direct  debits but do not show that instructions were not sent by 
NatWest previously. I accept that one company have said that they had not received any 
requests to change bank  details from NatWest before Mr As intervention.  
Where the evidence is incomplete  or conflicting, I need to decide whats most likely to have 
happened. Two of the direct debits did switch over as planned  along  with the account 
balance. I believe that NatWest did send the instructions as promised prior to the switchover 
date and from that point whatever happened with that information was out of their control.
Due to Mr As pre-emptive  actions  it is impossible to say that the payments would not have 
been collected correctly had Mr A not intervened. Mr A has not been subject to any financial 
loss and I cannot say that NatWest did anything wrong. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 December  2019.
