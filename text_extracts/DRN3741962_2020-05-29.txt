K821x#15Complaint
Mr D complains Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent to him 
irresponsibly.
Background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision dated  21 April 2020. 
An extract  from this is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I will not repeat that 
information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to partly uphold the complaint. I invited 
both parties to let me have any further  comments or evidence. Mr D has told us he doesnt  
have anything further to add. Sunny didnt  respond  to the provisional decision. 
My findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mr D accepted the provisional decision and Sunny  didnt respond  with any further 
comments or evidence it wanted  me to consider. So, I see no reason to depart from the 
findings that I previously  outlined  in my provisional  decision. 
So, in summary,  I still think Sunny was wrong to have provided Mr D loans 3  11 and loans 
14  17.  Ive explained below what Sunny  needs  to do to put things right. 
Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr D paid on loans 3 to 11 and 14 to 17;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 to 5 from Mr Ds credit file;
remove loans 6 to 11 and 14 to 17 from Mr Ds credit file entirely, this is because  the 
period of time Mr D owed Sunny money means  that any information still recorded 
about these loans is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr D a certificate showing how much  tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN37419622My final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I partly uphold Mr Ds 
complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr D as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 June  2020.

* Loan one was a running credit facility (RCF) and this is different to the instalment loans  that Mr D 
took afterwards. 
The RCF allows a consumer to either request funds up to their agreed credit limit in one go or take 
multiple drawdowns up to their limit. Mr D had a credit limit of £500. Each drawdown could be repaid 
via five monthly instalments.  
In our latest assessment an adjudicator didnt think it was wrong for Sunny to have granted  the RCF.  
But she didnt think it was likely Mr D could have continued with drawdowns and make his repayments 
in a way that was sustainable from the fifth drawdown.  So, she said Sunny shouldnt have allowed 
any further drawdowns on the RCF from 28 October 2014. This adjudicator also thought  loans 2 to 11 
shouldnt have been given but concluded that loans 12 onwards werent  given irresponsibly.  
Neither Mr D or Sunny have  replied to the latest adjudicators view.  But, Sunny has already accepted 
that something may have gone wrong when it provided loans 14 to 17, so it agreed to refund interest 
on these loans together with 8% simple interest. It also agreed  to update the credit file in line with the 
adjudicators recommendation. Mr D wasnt happy with this offer when it was made. 
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  And 
Ref: DRN37419624while Im still intending to partly uphold Mr Ds complaint, but I dont think as many loans should  be 
upheld and Ive explained why below. 
Mr D doesnt appear  to disagree  with our adjudicators  findings that Sunny didnt make an error by 
approving the RCF as well as the first four drawdowns,  neither does he appear to disagree with the 
outcome reached  for loans 12 and 13. It seems therefore that these  drawdowns and loans arent  in 
dispute and so I no longer think that I need to make  a finding about them.  
Ive also not considered whether Sunny  should have lent loans 14 to 17 as it has already agreed it 
shouldnt. But for clarity Ive set out what Sunny  has agreed to do for these loans in line with the 
adjudicators recommendation.   
So instead,  this decision will focus  on whether  Sunny did anything wrong when it granted the RCFs  
drawdowns from 28 October 2014 (when Mr D took his fifth drawdown) until 7 February  2016 (loan  
11). But I have kept the other  lending in mind  when thinking about  the overall lending relationship 
between Sunny and Mr D. 
For the lending that remains in dispute, Sunny had check if Mr D could afford  to pay back the 
amounts hed borrowed  without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was proportionate 
to the circumstances.  Sunnys checks could have taken into account  a number  of different  things, 
such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments  and Mr Ds income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, I think  in the early stages of a lending  relationship,  less thorough checks  might have 
been proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest Sunny should have done  more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for Mr D. These factors include:
Mr D having a low income (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid  being especially  high (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to 
meet a higher repayment  from a particular level of income); 
Mr D having a large number of loans and/or having  these loans over a long period of time 
(reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, 
or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr D coming  back  for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid  (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable  for Mr D.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr D could sustainably repay  his instalment loans   not just 
whether he technically had enough money to make his repayments. Having enough money  to make 
the repayments could of course  be an indicator  that Mr D was able to repay his loans sustainably. But 
it doesnt automatically  follow that this is the case. The Financial Conduct Authoritys (the industry  
regulatory) says in the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) states payments are sustainable if 
they are made without undue difficulties  and in particular, made on time,  while meeting  other 
reasonable commitments and without  having  to borrow to make them. If a lender  realises, or ought  
reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
There was also an expectation in October 2014, when the fifth drawdown  under the RCF was 
granted, that Sunny would  review and monitor how Mr D was using the RCF facility. CONC 6.7.2 says 
A firm must monitor a customers repayment record and take appropriate action where there are 
signs of actual  or possible repayment difficulties. So it wasnt enough  for Sunny to just assess  the 
further lending based on what it knew when the RCF had initially been approved. In October  2014, 
and throughout, it needed  to monitor how Mr D was using the facility - and then step in and provide 
help when or if it could see Mr D was or was likely having financial difficulties.
Ref: DRN37419625Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context,  and thought 
about what this means for Mr Ds complaint.
Our adjudicator thought that Sunny shouldnt  have lent from the fifth drawdown under  the RCF 
because such lending wouldnt have been sustainable. But I dont agree. 
I can see that Mr D had a credit limit under  the RCF of £500. He took four drawdowns totalling £475  in 
the first two weeks of having  the facility. He then repaid the outstanding balance  in full almost 
immediately before  drawing down £400 on 28 October  2014 and £100 on 6 November 2014 (taking 
him back up to the RCFs credit limit). The balance in connection with these two drawdowns was 
repaid three weeks later. Shortly afterwards,  Mr D took two further drawdowns which also took him 
back to the RCFs credit  limit. The outstanding balance  was then repaid within two weeks on 18 
December 2014. 
I think  the lending activity  under the RCF by December 2014 could have indicated that Mr Ds 
underlying financial situation was deteriorating.  I dont think though there was quite enough  evidence 
by this point  to say that a pattern of unsustainable lending  had become  established given  that Mr D 
hadnt breached his credit limit and hadnt  had the facility  for too long. So overall, I dont think  it was 
wrong of Sunny did anything wrong  in relation  to the RCF and I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint about  
this facility. 
There was then a gap of around seven  weeks after the RCF before the first instalment  loan of £250. 
Nine days later Mr D borrowed a further £150, taking his overall indebtedness to £400 as this new 
loan overlapped with the previous loan.  So, this was the fourth occasion when Mr Ds indebtedness 
had reached  £400, with generally quite short gaps following the repayment of previous batches of 
lending of between £400  and £500. 
I think  that this ought to have alerted Sunny  to the likelihood that Mr D was having problems 
managing his money.  So I dont  think he would have been able to sustainably  repay  loan 3 - 5. 
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr D, to see if there was a point 
at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful. And I agree  with our adjudicator that Sunny should have realised this at the time it provided 
loan 6. I say this because:
By loan 6 it was over six-months into the lending relationship during which Mr D had taken 
loans or batches of lending of between £400 to £500. In my view, Mr Ds loan history up until 
this point was a clear indication  that his underlying financial situation didnt seem to be 
improving; 
Mr D took some  loans shortly after having repaid previous ones.  For example,  loan 4 was 
taken out shortly after repayment of loans 2 and 3, loan 5 was taken out the day after 
repayment of loan 4 and loan 6 was taken out the same day as loan 5 had been repaid.  So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr D, on these  occasions, was 
having to borrow further to cover  the hole the repayment of his previous loans had left in his 
finances and that this was indicative of his indebtedness not being sustainable;
Mr D was borrowing broadly  similar amounts. Instalment loans 4, 5 and 6 were all for £500, 
following £400 being taken in February 2015 and batches of lending of between  £400 and 
£500 under  the RCF. I think its most  likely  this consistent pattern of the level of borrowing 
over the period showed  that Mr D didnt  just have  a
short-term cash-flow  problem but was probably  supporting regular living  expenses  or other 
financial commitments,    
Ref: DRN37419626Mr Ds lending history  was prolonged  with loans being taken out until December  2015 and 
then into early 2016 when  loan 11 was lent. The amount of time that Mr D spent  indebted to 
Sunny meant that he was servicing a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think  that Mr D lost out when Sunny provided loans 6 to 11 because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans  was likely to have had negative  implications on
Mr Ds ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost 
loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Ds complaint about his borrowing  from loan 3 to loan 11. And taken together 
with what Sunny has already agreed for loans 14 to 17, have set out what  it should do to put things 
right as detailed below.
