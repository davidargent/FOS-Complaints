There was a break in lending  between  loan 9 and loan 10 of around 14 months. This is a 
significant period  of time that has passed.  So I think it is fair from loan 10 that I consider a 
new lending  relationship between the parties.  I have therefore  considered  loans 1-9 and 
loans 10-15 as two separate lending chains.
MYJAR made  an offer to put things right in relation to loans 5-9. 
Our adjudicator didnt  feel MYJAR  had gone  far enough and upheld  Mr Ws complaint in part 
when he issued his view. He thought loans 5-9 and 14-15 shouldnt  have been given. 
MYJAR didnt agree.  So the complaint was passed to me, an ombudsman,  to make a 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN25816682MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because guidance given by The Office of Fair Trading and then The FCA 
through its Consumer  Credit Sourcebook  (CONC)  defines sustainable as being without 
undue difficulties. In particular the Sourcebook says the customer  should be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator, and for the same reasons, that there  was nothing to indicate 
MYJAR needed to do more when it approved loans 1-4 and 10-13. It was early  on in the 
lending relationship between the two parties  and the loan repayments for each one of these 
loans seemed affordable based on what Mr W had told MYJAR.  So I dont think MYJAR was 
wrong to give the first four loans of the first lending chain and loans 10-13 in the second to 
Mr W.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of MYJARs lending history  with Mr W for the two 
lending chains, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which  MYJAR should  reasonably  
Ref: DRN25816683have seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  And so MYJAR 
should have realised that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached at loan 
5 for the first lending chain. I say this because:
At this point MYJAR  ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr W had taken out and repaid 4 loans  within around 7 months 
and was now asking  for his fifth loan. So MYJAR ought to have realised it was more 
likely than not Mr W was having  to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loans were  leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Ws indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR. In fact, the 
amount Mr W had requested had steadily increased by the time he asked for loan 5. 
MYJAR ought to have  known  that Mr W was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. Mr W had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect; service a debt to MYJAR  over an extended period.
I think this pattern of lending should have alerted MYJAR to the likelihood that Mr W 
was having problems managing his money. I think that MYJAR  shouldve been 
concerned that Mr W might be borrowing elsewhere to repay its loans, again 
increasing his indebtedness unsustainably.
And I think that this point  was reached at loan 14 for the second  lending chain. I say this 
because:
At this point MYJAR  ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably again. Mr W had taken out and repaid 4 loans within  around 
12 months and was now asking for his fifth loan in this second  lending chain. So 
MYJAR ought to have  realised  it was more likely than not Mr W was having to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loans  were leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR. In fact, the 
amount Mr W had requested had increased by the time he asked for loan 14. MYJAR  
ought to have known that Mr W was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  
in his income but to meet an ongoing  need.  Mr W had paid large  amounts of interest 
to, in effect; service  a debt to MYJAR  over an extended period.
I think that Mr W lost out because MYJAR continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 to loan 
9 and 14 to 15 because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Ws ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5-9 and 14-15 for the reasons  given  above.
Ref: DRN25816684putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
Refund all interest  and charges Mr W paid on loans  5-9 and 14-15;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
The number of loans  taken from 5-9 and 14-15 means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse, so all entries about  loans 5-9 and 14-15  should be removed 
from Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must give Mr W 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. MYJAR Limited 
(trading as MYJAR) should pay Mr W compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 March  2020.
