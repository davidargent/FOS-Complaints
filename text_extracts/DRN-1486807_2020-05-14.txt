The complaint
Mrs C complains that Capital One (Europe) plc unfairly recorded missed payments on her 
credit file.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mrs C says the February 2019 payment was made. But Mrs C only paid £36 and the 
amount required to bring the account up to date was £280.99. I think Capital Ones 
decision to include February 2019 in the arrears was reasonable. 
The evidence provided by Capital One shows it contacted Mrs C about the arrears on 
her credit card throughout the period in question. Capital One also sent Mrs C 
monthly statements which set out the details of what payments she needed to make. 
Whilst I understand Mrs C has told us she didnt receive any of Capital Ones 
correspondence Im satisfied it did contact her as claimed. 
Capital One is obliged to report accurate information about how an account has been 
handled to the credit reference agencies. The missed payments Capital One has 
reported are a fair reflection of Mrs Ps payment history. 
As Im satisfied Capital One has reported accurate information to the credit reference 
agencies and that it has dealt with Mrs Cs complaint fairly Im not telling it to do 
anything else. 
For these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 June 2020.
