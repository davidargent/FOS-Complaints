K820x#14complaint
Miss A has complained  that Barclays Bank UK Plc (the bank)  hasnt compensated her 
enough for mishandling the issue of fraudulent  transactions  on her account. 
background
Miss A was unhappy  that the bank didnt record all the disputed transactions  and didnt  
refund the money to her within  the timescale promised. She said she had to keep phoning 
the bank. 
Our investigator agreed Miss A had to call the bank  several times  and in one call was told by 
the bank the money would be refunded within 24 hours. Instead the bank refunded  the 
money within 72 hours. 
The investigator noted the bank  had paid Miss A £25 for her phone call costs  and £20 for 
taking longer to refund  the money than the bank had indicated.  She (the investigator) 
thought that was fair and the bank didnt need  to do more.
Miss A asked for a review  of the investigators conclusion.  She referred to the stress the 
events had put her under  and how shed  had to switch banks as a result. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry  to disappoint Miss A but Ive reached  the same conclusion  as the investigator.  
While the bank took longer to refund Miss As money than they said they would, it was still 
refunded within a relatively short  time. 
I accept Miss A experienced stress, but I think the sums the bank paid amount to fair 
compensation overall. 
my final decision
I dont uphold Miss As complaint because Ive concluded Barclays  Bank UK Plc has already 
paid her enough compensation. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 April 2020.
