The complaint
Mr A complains about the service he received after he contacted National Westminster Bank 
Plc (NatWest) for support due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
What happened
Mr A entered into a loan agreement with NatWest in 2019 for a term of 24 months. In April 
2020, he asked NatWest for a payment holiday as he had been negatively impacted by 
Covid-19. NatWest agreed to a three-month payment holiday and it was put in place to start 
from May 2020. Mr A says he later realised that he only needed a two-month payment 
break, so he tried to end the arrangement and re-start the loan repayments.
But he says he received letters from NatWest saying his account was in arrears. He found 
the letters upsetting and says that NatWest treated him like a debtor. He knew that he owed 
money to NatWest for the May and June payments. But he says the letters didnt reflect the 
fact that these arrears were the result of an agreed payment holiday because of coronavirus, 
rather than him having fallen behind with payments. He says that the generic tone of the 
letters wasnt appropriate and didnt reflect his situation.
He says he tried calling NatWest multiple times to complain about the letters and to set up a 
regular payment to clear the arrears. He wanted to pay an additional £200 each month. But 
he says he had great difficulty getting through to NatWest to put this in place. He says he 
spent a huge amount of time on the phone waiting to get through and was passed from team 
to team, often getting cut off in the process or having to wait on hold again. He says his calls 
werent returned, his complaints werent investigated and that the whole process was 
extremely frustrating.
Mr A also complains that interest was applied to his loan account during the payment holiday 
and that his credit file was negatively impacted.
NatWest says that interest was applied to Mr As account during the payment holiday, but it 
was adjusted monthly. So it says Mr A hasnt been charged any additional interest. It also 
says it didnt make any adverse entries about the loan on his credit file. So it didnt uphold 
these aspects of his complaint. And it didnt agree that Mr As complaints hadnt been 
investigated.
But NatWest agreed that Mr A had received a poor level of service. It apologised and paid 
him compensation of £150 in total for the distress and inconvenience he experienced, plus 
£10.80 towards his call costs.
Mr A wasnt happy with NatWests response and brought the complaint to this service. Our 
Adjudicator didnt think NatWest had acted unfairly. But Mr A didnt agree and asked for his 
complaint to be reviewed by an Ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In April 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) released a package of temporary 
measures to help consumers who were negatively impacted by Covid-19. The guidance said
that firms should offer payment holidays of up to three months to such customers and that 
customers credit files shouldnt be affected by taking a payment holiday. Ive seen 
screenshots from NatWests system and Im satisfied that it didnt report any adverse 
information about Mr As account to the Credit Reference Agencies. So I dont find that his 
credit file was negatively affected by the payment holiday.
Turning to the interest on Mr As account, NatWest said that interest which accrued during 
the payment holiday had been adjusted and credited back into the account. Its Final 
Response Letter said the interest applied to your loan deferral payments is being refunded 
monthly. But I dont think this explained the position clearly to Mr A. I think NatWests 
comments suggested that all interest applied during the payment holiday had been refunded. 
But that wasnt the case.
NatWest has clarified that it was only interest on the missed payments which was refunded. 
The usual monthly interest was still applied to Mr As account during the payment holiday 
and this hasnt been refunded to date. Im not satisfied that Mr A was told when he 
requested the payment holiday that hed continue to be charged interest during it, so I asked 
NatWest about this.
NatWest accepts that its Final Response Letter didnt make it clear that it was only interest 
on the arrears which had been refunded. As a result, it has agreed to refund the rest of the 
interest which was applied during Mr As payment holiday. This will result in a refund to Mr A 
of £34.41. I think thats fair, as it will put Mr A in the position of not having been charged any 
interest during the payment holiday.
Ill now consider the overall service Mr A received from NatWest including letters he was 
sent about the payment holiday. NatWest says that, even though the reason Mr A didnt 
make the May and June payments was because of the payment holiday which it had agreed, 
its system viewed Mr As account as technically in arrears. It says this led to a standard 
arrears notice being sent to him. I can understand why this happened. But I can also imagine 
how distressing and frustrating this was from Mr As point of view.
NatWest has also explained that, although Mr A only took a payment holiday for two months, 
its system was set up to deal with three-month payment holidays. It says thats why some of 
its communications referred to the wrong end date. I dont think it was unreasonable for 
NatWest to have standardised messages in place to deal with the circumstances 
surrounding Covid-19. But I can also understand Mr As point of view that NatWest wasnt 
treating him as an individual.
I think it was a difficult balance for businesses to strike between having to respond quickly to 
the pandemic by putting measures in place to help large numbers of customers and still 
managing to communicate appropriately with individual customers. NatWest has already 
accepted that the level of service Mr A received wasnt good. It has apologised and paid him 
compensation of £150 plus call costs of £10.80. In the circumstances here, I think thats fair. 
So Im not going to ask NatWest to do any more about that.
For the reasons above, Im going to uphold this complaint so that I can direct NatWest to 
refund the interest of £34.41 to Mr A. But Im not going to ask it to do any more.My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc should 
refund interest of £34.41 to Mr A.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 April 2022.
