The complaint
Mr J complains that esure Insurance Limited should pay his claim on a motor insurance 
policy.
What happened
Mr J had a car made in 2008. For the year from 23 October 2018 he renewed a 
comprehensive policy with esure.
In March 2019 Mr J reported the theft of the car. 
In August 2019 esure declined his claim. After Mr J complained to esure it provided a final 
response dated 16 August 2019. Unhappy with that response, Mr J brought his complaint to 
us later that month.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that 
esure had done anything wrong. He thought esure had investigated Mr Js claim fairly and 
reasonably. He said that if Mr J were to provide evidence from the manufacturer of his car 
esure would reconsider the claim.
Mr J disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. He says, in summary, that:.
The car was recalled in June 2018, and repaired under warranty on 13 June 2018 
when its mileage was 73,836.
The key doesnt show when the car was last driven.
The car has never been involved in a crash.
The key was last scanned on 6 April 2019 when esure had it.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have no reason to doubt that on 13 June 2018 the cars mileage was 73,836.  Its common 
ground that Mr Js car had an MOT test on 21 December 2018 when its mileage was about 
77,000.
On 10 March 2019 Mr J reported his car stolen from where he left it the previous day near a 
friends house. 
When esure asked for the keys, Mr J provided what he said was the only key he had.Mr J has provided a statement from his mechanic who did the MOT on 21 December 2018. 
That statement says he was unable to get a diagnostic reading off the key. 
More recently Mr J has provided some information from a dealership of the car 
manufacturer. It doesnt say that a key doesnt show when someone last used that key in the 
car.
And according to esures checks on the key Mr J gave it, that key hadnt been used since 12 
May 2018 when the cars mileage was about 72,000. As the mileage in December 2018 was 
about 77,000, the car had done about 5,000 miles using a key that wasnt the key Mr J gave 
esure.
That implies that when esure asked Mr J for the keys, he gave them one key knowing that 
there was another key that had been used in the car more recently. 
I consider that esure reasonably concluded that this undermined the credibility of his report 
of the circumstances of the theft. Its not necessary for esure to show what the 
circumstances really were. I dont find that esure treated Mr J unfairly or unreasonably by 
declining his claim.
 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct esure Insurance Limited to do anything further in response to this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2020.
