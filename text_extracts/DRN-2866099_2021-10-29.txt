DRN-2866099
The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as X, is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA, 
applied a charge to a monetary transfer it received. 
What happened
X received a payment of £50,000 into its PayPal account from the personal PayPal account 
of one of its directors. When the payment was received, X noted that PayPal had applied a 
charge of £1,450.30 to the transfer. X wasnt happy about this, so it raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Xs complaint. It noted that commercial payments to accounts, such as the 
payment in question, attracted a 2.9% charge as per PayPals terms and conditions. As 
such, PayPal felt that the charge had been applied correctly and it didnt uphold the 
complaint.
X wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so it referred its complaint to this service. One of 
our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also felt that PayPal had applied the 
charge correctly and in line with the terms of PayPals accounts, so they also didnt uphold 
this complaint.
X remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how it must have been disappointing for X to have received the transfer into 
its PayPal account from the personal PayPal account of one of its directors but to then have 
realised that PayPal had applied a charge to that transfer. 
However, PayPals terms clearly state that commercial payments will incur a charge of 2.9%. 
And, given that the £1,450.30 charge amount does correspond to 2.9% of the transferred 
amount, it appears that the amount that was charged by PayPal was correct in this instance. 
X have suggested that the transfer should have been treated as being a payment to a friend, 
which wouldnt incur a charge from PayPal. Im not convinced by this argument, and given 
that X is a limited company, it seems clear to me that the transfer does constitute a 
commercial payment such that it would qualify for the charge that X is disputing here.
X also contend that PayPals terms dont specifically list a transfer from a directors personal 
PayPal account as being a commercial transfer. However, while PayPals terms do include 
specific examples of commercial payments, they also include the phrase any other 
commercial type of transaction. And, as mentioned previously, given that the transfer was a 
payment to a limited company, Im satisfied that it does qualify as a commercial transaction 
under PayPals terms and therefore that PayPals application of a charge to the payment is 
fair and in line with those terms. 
All of which means that I find it difficult to conclude that PayPal have acted unreasonably or 
unfairly here, and it follows from this that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing 
PayPal to take any further action at this time.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that X was wanting here, but I trust that it will 
understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask X to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 November 2021.
