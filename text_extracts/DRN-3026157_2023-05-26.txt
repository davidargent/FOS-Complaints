The complaint
Mr B complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, trading as Barclaycard, wont refund to him the 
money that he paid for some holiday club membership points using his credit card. 
What happened
Mr B and his wife had some holiday club membership points and they entered into a 
purchase agreement in July 2016 to buy 13,000 more membership points to give them gold 
membership. The total price payable for the additional points was £13,100. Mr B paid 
£3,275 to the holiday club in August 2016 using a credit card from another credit provider 
and, later that month, he paid the balance of £9,825 using his Barclaycard credit card.
Mr B made claims to Barclaycard and the other credit provider in November 2016 under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 because he said that the holiday company had 
breached its contract and misrepresented its services to him. Barclaycard said that the 
payment was made via a third-party escrow and administration service so there wasnt a 
valid debtor-creditor-supplier agreement so it wasnt in a position to accept Mr Bs section 75 
claim. It then credited £25 to his account because it hadnt followed the correct complaint 
process but said that, based on the written evidence that it had received, there was no proof 
to uphold his claim. The other credit provider agreed to refund £3,275 to Mr B because of the 
comments that hed made to it. Mr B wasnt satisfied with Barclaycards response so a 
complaint was made to this service.
Our adjudicator didnt recommend that Mr Bs complaint should be upheld. She believed that 
Mr B had made a valid section 75 claim, as a debtor-creditor-supplier link had been 
established. She thought a more balanced presentation of the products cost, limitations and 
benefits wouldve given Mr B and his wife a clearer understanding of what they were buying, 
but she didnt think that that was the same as the product being misrepresented and she 
didnt think that Barclaycard acted unfairly when it decided not to uphold his claim under 
section 75. She also considered any claim that he might have under section 140A of the 
Consumer Credit Act but she didnt think that the circumstances gave rise to an unfair 
relationship.
Mr B has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. Hes provided a 
detailed respond to our adjudicators recommendations in which he has described what he 
says happened in July 2016 and he says that his claim was made under section 75. He also 
says that he and his wife understood that they were being offered an exceptional sales deal 
that was unique to them but that wasnt the case and what was being offered to them turned 
out to be misrepresented and a con. He says that there are three key points to be 
considered:
the value of the points was potentially £9 then £3.07 and then £1 which is a 
misrepresentation of the facts;
the number of points went from 17,000 to 13,000; and
the salesman said they could rent their points back to the holiday company which 
was untrue.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Bs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr B paid for the membership points in August 2016 using credit provided by 
Barclaycard and another credit provider  the other credit provider has refunded to 
Mr B the payment of £3,275 and hes made a claim to Barclaycard for it to refund the 
other £9,825 to him under section 75;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Bs claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclaycards response to 
his claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr B and his wife signed documents in July 2016 including the purchase agreement, 
the terms and conditions, the standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be 
given and a key information document;
Mr B described in a letter to Barclaycard in April 2017 what he and his wife say 
happened in July 2016 and hes provided a similar description of those events in his 
response to our adjudicators recommendations;
he says: the salesman suggested that we upgrade from Silver to Gold Membership 
by purchasing 17,000 points at a cost of £3.07 per point; but he then:  agreed that 
we could buy 13,000 instead of [17,000] points at £1 each and we signed the 
documents to that effect; we were persuaded to purchase the points believing that 
we were paying about 60% less than they were worth; and: we have spoken to 
other  members and found that the same sales scenario happened to them;
I can understand Mr Bs frustration that the deal that he got wasnt as good as the 
deal that he thought that hed got  but he and his wife agreed to buy 13,000 points 
at £1 for each point to upgrade their membership from silver to gold;
it seems to be clear that the holiday company used sales techniques to persuade 
them to agree to the purchase but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that it misrepresented the points to them  they received the 13,000 points that 
theyd agreed to buy at the price that theyd agreed to pay and they were upgraded 
from silver to gold membership;
Mr B has provided a copy of the holiday companys annual member benefits directory 
and it describes the benefits that were available for gold and silver members  Mr B 
says that he didnt get a gold card but Ive seen no evidence to show that the gold 
membership benefits werent available to him and his wife;
Mr B and his wife signed the key information document and it describes the 
exchange programme that was available but says that the holiday company:  does 
not currently operate a resale or buy-back programme; and Ive not seen enough 
evidence to show that the holiday company misrepresented to them that it would rent 
their points from them; 
Ive carefully considered Mr Bs descriptions of what he and his wife say happened in 
July 2016 that he provided in his letter to Barclaycard in April 2017 and in his response to our adjudicators recommendations  and also the other evidence that 
hes provided - but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
membership points were misrepresented to him and his wife by the holiday company 
or that they were induced into entering into the purchase agreement by any such 
misrepresentations;
nor am I persuaded that the membership points were sold to Mr B and his wife in July 
2016 in a way that would cause Barclaycard to have any liability to Mr B under 
section 75 or that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday company;
Mr Bs letter to Barclaycard in April 2017 included a complaint about the sales 
practices used by the holiday company so our adjudicator also considered any claim 
that he would have under section 140A  that section gives a court the power, 
amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under 
a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the 
debtor and the creditor;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr B and his wife were 
unduly pressurised into entering into the purchase agreement or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mr Bs credit card had a credit limit of £11,400 and his balance before he made the 
payment to the holiday company was £108.66  he chose to use his credit card to 
make a payment of £9,825 to the holiday company in August 2016 and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that his relationship with 
Barclaycard was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude 
that there was an unfair relationship between Mr B and Barclaycard in these 
circumstances;
Mr Bs other credit provider agreed to refund £3,275 to Mr B because of the 
comments that hed made to it, but that was a decision for it to make and I dont 
consider that its offer to refund to Mr B the payment that hed made to the holiday 
company is enough to show that Barclaycard should also refund to him the payment 
that he made to the holiday company;
one of the criteria for a claim under section 75 is that there must be a debtor-creditor-
supplier agreement and our adjudicator believed that a debtor-creditor-supplier link 
had been established but, as Mr Bs credit card statement shows that the payment of 
£9,825 was made to a trustee, and not to the holiday company (even though the 
holiday company is also referred to on the statement), its now possible that there 
was no such agreement in place following the High Courts judgment last year in the 
case of Steiner v National Westminster Bank PLC;
but as Im not persuaded that Mr Bs section 75 claim should be upheld, I consider 
that theres no need for me to make any finding as to whether there was a debtor-
creditor-supplier agreement in these arrangements;
Barclaycard said that Mr Bs payment was made via a third-party escrow and 
administration service so there wasnt a valid debtor-creditor-supplier agreement so it 
wasnt in a position to accept his section 75 claim and it said that, based on the 
written evidence that it had received, there was no proof to uphold his claim;
it also credited £25 to his account because it hadnt followed the correct complaint 
process but Im not persuaded that its responses to Mr Bs section 75 claim were 
unfair or unreasonable; and
I sympathise with Mr B and his wife for the issues that theyve had with the holiday 
company, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for 
me to require Barclaycard to refund to Mr B any of the payment of £9,825 that he made, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 June 2023.
