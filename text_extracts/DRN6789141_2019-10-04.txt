K821x#15complaint
Mr S says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny)  irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 25 loans Sunny provided to Mr S between  December 2014 and 
July 2016. Some  of Mr S borrowing history  is attached as an appendix at the end of this 
decision.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr S complaint in part and thought the loans from loan 7 onwards  
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and offered redress on loans 1 and 19 to 25 
instead. Mr S didnt accept Sunnys offer and as the complaint remained unresolved,  it was 
passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN67891412Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr S complaint.
As Sunny agrees  that it shouldnt have lent Mr S loans  1 and 19 to 25, I havent  
reconsidered those  loans here but to say the offer Sunny has made  is in line with what this 
service recommends. The adjudicator didnt recommend that loans 2 to 6 should  be upheld 
and Mr S hasnt disagreed with this finding. So Ive focused my decision on loans 7 to 18.
Sunny has said that before it lent any loan to Mr S, it asked him about his monthly  income 
and monthly living costs. Mr S declared  income varied from £1,400 to £2,000 and his 
declared expenses  varied  from £125  to £400. Sunny  also says it searched Mr S credit  file. 
From the results of the search  Sunny  provided, I cant  see that there  was adverse 
information like defaults or county court  judgements (CCJs) recorded on his file.
As loan 7 was now Mr S seventh loan without  any significant break, I think  the pattern of 
lending is relevant here. So Ive looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with 
Mr S, with a view to seeing  if there was a point  at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so Sunny should  have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr S case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
at this point Sunny  ought to have  realised Mr S was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken out seven loans within about five months  and although 
Mr S had six instalments to repay  the loans, hed been  repaying them  within a month 
like payday loans.  So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not that 
Mr S indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably and he was having to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances; and 
from loan 7 onwards  Mr S was provided with a new loan within  days  of settling a 
previous one and several of his loans  overlapped; and
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 25 was 
taken out more than 18 months after Mr S first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr S 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
Ref: DRN67891413As Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards I think that Mr S lost out 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr S indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr S ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 7 to 18 and Sunny should put things right 
on these loans in addition to loans 1, 19 to 25 it already offered on.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 1 and 7 to 25;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 1 from Mr S credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  7 to 25 should be removed  from Mr S 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr S complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr S compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 November 2019.
