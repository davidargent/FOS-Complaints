The complaint
Mr K complains that NewDay Limited wont refund to him the money that he paid for a used 
car.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr K bought a used car in January 2018  he paid £100 for it using his NewDay 
credit card and £6,900 by other means;
he had the car inspected within a few weeks and a number of significant issues were 
identified and repaired but the head gasket failed in April 2018 and had to be 
replaced;
he made a claim to NewDay about the car in January 2018 under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974  there was a delay in it responding to his claim and he 
provided it with further information about his issues with the car;
it said in January 2019 that hed lost his right to reject the car but it accepted that it 
was liable under section 75 for the repair costs and in July 2019 it agreed to pay a 
total of £5,265.81 to reimburse him for the cost of repairs - it also credited his 
account with £175 to apologise for the inconvenience that hed been caused; 
but there were further issues with the car and Mr K arranged for it to be inspected by 
an independent expert in October 2019  the inspection report said: 
The boot lid issues and leaks are clearly a problem of poor fitting which has 
caused significant damage to the boot lid frame and will never be correct 
unless the lid is replaced and drilled correctly. The cost of this would be circa 
£3500 with parts, fitting and paint operations and rectifications to damage 
inside the vehicle and new carpets. It would be unreasonable I feel to expect 
a customer to have to keep drying his windows in order to use the vehicle due 
to a patent fault which should have been rectified at the outset. In this 
respect, it most certainly was not of satisfactory quality;
Mr K complained to this service about the car and our investigator concluded that it 
was fair for him to be able to reject it - she recommended that NewDay should collect 
the car from Mr K, refund the price that hed paid for it (less a charge of £115 each 
month for fair usage) and that it should pay interest on the amounts that it had 
already paid to Mr K; 
NewDay hasnt responded to those recommendations but Mr K says that he 
shouldnt have to pay £115 each month from January 2018 for the use of the car and 
that he made a statutory off-road notification about the car in April 2020 when its 
mileage was 76,031;
he says that there are brake issues with the car so its not safe to drive and that he 
has no real use of the car  he also says that he should be reimbursed for his 
insurance and tax costs for the car, the £180 that he paid for the car to be inspected 
and he complains about the way that NewDay has dealt with his complaint;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ks complaint about NewDay, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the dealer that supplied the car 
and that NewDays response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  
but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ks claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when 
it was sold to Mr K and NewDay has reimbursed him for the cost of repairs  but the 
inspection report shows that there are still significant faults with the car and I dont 
consider that its economically viable to pay a further £3,500 for repairs to this car;
I consider that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for NewDay to 
accept Mr Ks rejection of the car and that it should arrange for the car to be collected 
from him and to take ownership of the car (Mr Ks co-operation will be required for 
that to happen);
Mr K paid a total of £7,000 for the car and hes been able to use it to drive more than 
16,000 miles since he bought it  hes declared the car off-road but Im not 
persuaded that the brake issues about which hes complained were present when he 
bought the car and I consider that it was his choice to make that declaration because 
he then had no real use of the car;
the investigator recommended that a charge of £115 for each month that hes had 
the car would be fair and reasonable  and I consider that to be a fair and reasonable 
basis for Mr K to pay for the use that hes had from the car  so I find that NewDay 
should refund to Mr K £7,000 less the monthly charge of £115 from January 2018 
until the car is collected from Mr K;
NewDay has already paid £5,265.81 to Mr K to reimburse him for the cost of repairs 
 but there was a significant delay between the costs being incurred and the payment 
being made to him  I agree with the investigator that NewDay should pay interest on 
the amount that it paid to him from the date that each of the costs was incurred by 
Mr K until the date that it reimbursed him for those costs;
insurance and tax costs are ordinary running costs of a car and Im not persuaded 
that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require NewDay to reimburse Mr K for 
those costs  but I consider that it should reimburse him for the £180 that he paid for 
the inspection report (with interest); and
NewDay has already paid £175 compensation to Mr K for the inconvenience that hes 
been caused, Im not persuaded that its failed to comply with its statutory obligations 
and I dont consider that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for it to 
pay him any compensation other than as described above.Putting things right
I consider that Mr K should be allowed to reject the car and that NewDay should take the 
actions described above.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ks complaint and I order NewDay Limited to:
1. Arrange for the car to be collected from Mr K at no cost to him and to take 
ownership of the car.
2. Make a payment to Mr K to reimburse him for the £7,000 that he paid for the car 
less a charge of £115 for each month from January 2018 until the car is collected.
3. Pay £180 to Mr K to reimburse him for the cost of the inspection report.
4. Pay interest on the amount at 3 above at an annual rate of 8% simple from the 
date of payment to the date of settlement.
5. Pay interest on the amounts that it paid to Mr K in July 2019 to reimburse him for 
the repair costs at an annual rate of 8% simple from the dates that Mr K made 
those payments until the date that the cost was reimbursed to him.
HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from the interest payments referred 
to above. NewDay must give Mr K a certificate showing how much tax its deducted if he 
asks it for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 December 2020.
