K821x#15complaint
Mr P says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny)  irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 24 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr P between  October 2016 
and March 2018. Some information  about  Mr Ps lending history is in an appendix at the end 
of this decision.
When Mr P complained to Sunny it upheld loans  2 to 5 but said it lent the other loans 
responsibly. Unhappy  with the offer Mr P referred his complaint to this service. One of our 
adjudicators looked at his complaint thought  the loans from loans 6 onwards shouldnt  have 
been given as well. Sunny didnt  respond to the adjudication and the complaint was passed 
to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN53683542Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if they need  to borrow further to do so. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
As Sunny has agreed that it shouldnt have lent Mr P loans 2 to 5, I havent  gone into further 
details about those loans here. Also Mr P hasnt  disagreed with the adjudicators finding that 
loan 1 wasnt wrongly lent, I dont think this loan is still in dispute  and have focussed  my 
decision on loan 6 onwards.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr P, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
6. I say this because by loan 6, Mr P had been borrowing regularly from Sunny without any 
breaks. And most of the previous loans  overlapped which meant that he was repaying  Sunny 
for more than one loan at a time.
I note that there was around a four month break between  loans 5 and 6 but given that Mr P 
had either  been  repaying or taking  out a new loan on a monthly  basis from loans 1 to 5, I 
dont think this gap in lending was sufficient  for Sunny to reasonably believe that his financial 
circumstances had improved.
From loan 6 onwards Mr P was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a previous 
one and in many instances he had overlapping loans. So Sunny ought to have realised it 
was more likely than not Mr P was reliant  on these loans and was having to borrow  further to 
fill the hole repaying the previous loans was leaving in his finances, and that Mr Ps 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr P wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 24 was taken out 
17 months after Mr Ps first. 
I think that Mr P lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
and:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ps 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
Ref: DRN53683543So I agree with the adjudicator that Sunny shouldnt have given Mr P loan 6 onwards and Im 
upholding the complaint  about loans 6 to 24  and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on loans 2 to 24;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 2 to 5 from Mr Ps credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 24 should be removed from 
Mr Ps credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr P a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ps complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr P compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 August 2019.
