The complaint
Mr T says PDL Finance Limited, trading as Mr Lender (Mr Lender), irresponsibly lent to 
him. Mr T says Mr Lender should have seen he had a county court judgment against him, he 
was reliant on this type of lending and was borrowing from multiple of short-term credit 
providers. He wasnt able to keep up with his household bills because of the loan 
repayments. 
What happened
This complaint is about nine short-term loans Mr Lender provided to Mr T between October 
2013 and December 2016. There are two chains in lending. Mr Ts borrowing history is as 
follows:

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ts complaint and thought that loans two and three and 
loans six to nine shouldnt have been given. For loan two the repayment was a significant 
proportion of Mr Ts income and the repayment for this loan was unsustainable so loan two 
and subsequent lending shouldnt have been given. For loan six and onwards it should have 
been evident that Mr T was having problems managing his money. 
Mr Lender disagreed but did offer to uphold loans seven and eight. It said the other lending 
was affordable and it also said it have factored in any other credit commitments Mr T had 
declared. 
We put the offer to Mr T, but he didnt wish to accept it.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr T 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr T didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one and loans four and five 
shouldnt be upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about 
these loans. So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of 
the borrowing relationship Mr T had with Mr Lender. So, it is something I will take into 
account when considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
I should first say that I agree that there are two chains in lending. There was a break of nine 
months between loan three being repaid and loan four being taken and it was relatively early 
in the borrowing relationship. Because of this I dont think its unreasonable for Mr Lender to 
have assumed that Mr T had overcome whatever the financial circumstances were that 
caused him to take high-cost credit in the first instance. A break in a chain of lending, in effect, starts the clock ticking again on what we would consider to be proportionate checks 
a business should carry out when taking into account the length of the borrowing relationship 
with a consumer.  
Chain one  loans one to three
When Mr T returned for further lending at loan two, I note it was only two days after loan one 
had been repaid and it was for more than double the amount. Mr Lenders records show that 
Mr Ts net income at the time was £1,600 and that his outgoings were £450 which included 
£50 for other loan repayments. This would have left Mr T with a disposable income of £1,150 
with which to pay off the loan which was due to be repaid the following month. I think the 
repayment amount of £910.00 was a too significant proportion of Mr Ts income and it would 
be unlikely he would be able to sustainably make the repayment. 
I note from Mr Lenders transactions statement for this loan that Mr T did defer making the 
repayment three times which incurred an additional fee and interest charges each time. And 
Mr T wasnt in the position to repay the loan until March 2014 when it was initially due to be 
repaid the month after it was borrowed in November 2013. So, I think this makes clear that 
the lending was unaffordable for Mr T and the repayment for this loan and any subsequent 
loans in the chain was unsustainable. Mr Lender should have recognised this and not 
agreed to give the loans to Mr T.  
Chain two  loans four to nine
Loan six was the third loan to be taken in chain two and I notice a pattern of borrowing was 
beginning to emerge where Mr T would return for further borrowing within days of repaying 
his previous loan. 
When Mr Lender asked Mr T about his circumstances his income was again recorded as 
being £1,600 and his outgoings were £855 including £200 for other loan repayments. Mr 
Lender confirmed Mr T wasnt in an IVA, bankrupt or in a debt management plan. But I think 
if proportionate checks had been carried out Mr Lender would have seen Mr T was due to 
make repayments on three other short-term loans he had. 
So, I think it was clear that Mr Ts emerging pattern of borrowing and his lending from other 
short-term credit providers would have made it clear he was having problems managing his 
money. And I note the monthly repayment for the other three loans he already had were 
already well in excess of Mr Ts recorded disposable expenditure amount of £745. If Mr 
Lender had carried out proportionate checks, I dont think it would have agreed to the 
lending. So, I dont think loan six and the subsequent loans should have been given. 
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans two and three and loans six to nine and Mr 
Lender should put things right.
Putting things right
I appreciate Mr Lender has already offered redress for loans seven and eight, but I include 
them for completeness. 
refund all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans two and three and loans six to 
nine;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;remove any negative information about loans two and three and loans six to nine 
from Mr Ts credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
must give Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ts complaint. PDL Finance Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 October 2020.
