The complaint
Ms V complains that PDL Finance Limited trading as Mr Lender was irresponsible in its 
lending to her.
What happened
Mr Lender provided Ms V with nine loans between November 2015 and June 2019. Further 
details are set out below.
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount
1 03/11/2015 24/03/2016 5 £500.00
2 24/03/2016 28/09/2016 6 £500.00
3 29/09/2016 28/03/2017 6 £640.00
4 29/04/2017 28/07/2017 3 £390.00
5 30/07/2017 27/10/2017 3 £200.00
6 29/11/2017 28/02/2018 3 £270.00
7 29/04/2018 27/07/2018 3 £400.00
8 27/03/2019 26/06/2019 3 £300.00
9 28/06/2019 24/04/2020 6 £500.00
Ms V said that Mr Lender wasnt responsible in its lending to her. She said it continued to 
lend to her either shortly after or even before previous loans had been repaid.
Mr Lender said that before the loans were provided it carried out affordability, employment 
and credit checks. It said that Ms V was in full time employment and the repayments were 
proportionate to her income and disposable income. It noted the gap between loans 7 and 8 
and didnt accept that the loans had been lent irresponsibly.
Our adjudicator partially upheld this complaint. He thought given the significant gap between 
loan 7 being repaid and loan 8 being provided the loans fell into two lending chains. The first 
lending chain containing loans 1 to 7 and the second lending chain containing loans 8 and 9.
Our adjudicator didnt think it unreasonable that Mr Lender provided loans 1 to 3 and 8 to 9. 
But he didnt think Ms V should have been provided with loans 4 to 7.
Mr Lender didnt agree with our adjudicators view. It said that the amounts Ms V borrowed 
decreased with loan 4 being for half the amount of loan 3 and the amounts then continuing 
to decrease. It didnt think the timing of Ms Vs loans was an issue and said that each loan 
was assessed individually, and Ms Vs credit check didnt raise concerns.
My provisional conclusions
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. I concluded in summary:
There was a gap in the lending between loans 7 and 8 of eight months. Therefore, 
the lending fell into two lending chains, the first including loans 1 to 7 the second 
including loans 8 and 9.
Before the loans were provided information about Ms Vs income and expenses was 
gathered and credit checks carried out. Noting the information received and the 
repayment amounts compared to Ms Vs income, I thought these checks were 
proportionate in the early stages of the lending relationship. As the checks suggested 
that loans 1 to 3 were affordable I didnt find that Mr Lender was wrong to provide 
these loans.
By the time of loan 4, Ms V had been borrowing from Mr Lender for around 17 
months with a break of a month between loan 3 being repaid and loan 4 being 
provided. Loan 4 was for a much lower amount than the previous loan (£390 
compared to £640) and it was also a lower amount than loans 1 and 2. Before this 
loan was provided, Ms Vs income was verified and a credit check carried out which 
didnt show any other outstanding short term loans at that time or other issues that I 
think should have raised concerns. Therefore, without further evidence I didnt find I 
had enough to say that Mr Lender shouldnt have provided this loan.
Ms V repaid loan 4 and took out another loan shortly after. Loan 5 was for a lower 
amount than the previous loan. I noted Ms V had now been borrowing for several 
months but as the amounts were reducing, Ms V was repaying her loans and this 
loan appeared affordable, I didnt find at this stage I had enough to say that this loan 
shouldnt have been provided.
By loan 6, Ms V had been borrowing from Mr Lender for around 22 of the previous 24 
months. There was a short break between loan 5 being repaid and loan 6 being 
provided but I didnt think this was enough to say that a break in borrowing had 
occurred. This was the sixth loan in two years and was for a higher amount than the 
previous loan suggesting that any pattern of reduction in borrowing that had 
previously been shown wasnt being sustained. Therefore, at this stage I think that 
Mr Lender should have been concerned that Ms V had become persistently reliant on 
the borrowing and shouldnt have provided this and the subsequent loan in this 
lending chain (loan 7).
Loan 8 was the start of a new lending chain and I thought the checks carried out 
before loans 8 and 9 were provided were proportionate. As the information provided 
suggested these loans were affordable for Ms V I didnt find I could say these loans 
shouldnt have been provided.
Overall, I upheld this complaint regarding loans 6 and 7.
Ms V accepted my provisional decision and Mr Lender confirmed it had no further 
information to provide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.We've set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. I have taken this 
into account when considering Ms Vs complaint.
As I set out in my provisional decision, I dont find I have enough to say that loans 1 to 5 in 
the first lending chain and loans 8 and 9 in the second lending chain shouldnt have been 
provided. However, I dont think it reasonable that loans 6 and 7 were provided. As no new 
information was given in response to my provisional decision, my conclusions havent 
changed, and I am upholding this complaint regarding loans 6 and 7. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Mr Lender should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it not lent loans 6 and 7 to Ms V.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Ms V may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between her and this particular lender which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt 
a viable option, she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that, 
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Ms V in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Ms V would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Mr Lenders liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
As I uphold this complaint in regard to loans 6 and 7, Mr Lender should:
refund all interest and charges that Ms V paid on loans 6 and 7;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
the number of loans taken means any information recorded about them is adverse. 
So, all entries about loans 6 and 7 should be removed from Ms V's credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
must give Ms V a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans 6 and 7. PDL Finance 
Limited trading as Mr Lender should take the actions set out above in resolution of this 
complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms V to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2021.
