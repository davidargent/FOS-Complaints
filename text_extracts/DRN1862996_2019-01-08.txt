K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  gave him loans  
that he couldnt afford to repay.  
background
Mr C was given 11 loans  by Sunny  between June 2016 and January 2017.  Each  of the loans 
was repayable in six monthly instalments. The loans were taken in five distinct chains, with 
Mr C having up to three loans open  at any time, and repaying several loans  on the same 
day. Mr C has repaid all the loans except for his last. That loan has a balance outstanding 
that Mr C has been  repaying to a third party debt collection company. A summary of Mr Cs 
borrowing from Sunny  is as follows;

Mr Cs complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He thought  that the checks 
Sunny had done before agreeing the first three loans had been sufficient. But he thought 
more checks should have been  done  before the remaining  loans were  provided. And he 
thought that better checks would have shown  Sunny  that Mr C couldnt sustainably afford 
loans 5 to 11. So he asked Sunny to pay Mr C some  compensation.
Sunny accepted our adjudicators assessment and offered the suggested compensation to 
Mr C. It said that it would first use the compensation to clear the outstanding balance  on 
Mr Cs final loan, and then pay him the remainder.  Mr C didnt accept that offer  he instead 
asked that Sunny pay him the compensation and write off his outstanding balance on the 
final loan. So, as the complaint hasnt been  resolved informally, it has been  passed to me, 
an ombudsman, to decide. This is the last stage  of our process.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Ref: DRN18629962Sunny was required to lend responsibly. It needed to make checks to see whether Mr C 
could afford  to pay back each loan before it lent to him. Those checks  needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr C was borrowing, and his lending  history,  but 
there was no set list of checks Sunny had to do.
I have seen that Sunny has accepted our adjudicators findings in relation to the loans it 
gave to Mr C. And I havent seen  anything that suggests Mr C disagrees with those findings 
either. And for completeness I would add that I also agree with our adjudicators findings and 
summarise my thoughts  below.
Before lending to Mr C, Sunny asked  him for details of his income, and normal expenditure. 
And it checked his credit  file too. I havent seen anything in those credit checks  that I think 
should have caused additional concerns  to the lender.
Each of the loans  given to Mr C needed  to be repaid  in six monthly  instalments. So the 
amounts that Mr C needed to repay  each  month  were smaller than if hed taken a normal 
payday loan. But of course he was committing to making those repayments over a far longer 
period. And on many occasions Mr C had more than one loan open  at the same time.
But taking all that into account I think the checks Sunny did before agreeing the first three  
loans were sufficient. The amounts  Mr C needed to repay appeared easily affordable  based  
on what hed said about his disposable income.  And at this early stage of its relationship  with 
Mr C I think it was reasonable for Sunny to rely on the information he provided  about his 
finances.
By the time of the fourth loan I think Sunny should  have  been concerned  that a repeated 
lending pattern was emerging. I think it would have been reasonable at this stage for Sunny  
to gather some additional information about Mr Cs finances by asking him for specific details 
of any other  short term lending he was already committed to repaying.  But even if it had 
done these further checks I still think Sunny would have concluded this fourth loan was 
affordable for Mr C.
Two days after repaying his fourth loan Mr C asked to borrow again. I think by now (this was 
Mr Cs fifth loan request in just over two months) Sunny should have realised that it was 
unlikely that Mr Cs finances were as healthy  as he was declaring. I think from this point 
onwards Sunny should have independently checked  Mr Cs true financial  position.
And had it done  so Sunny would  have discovered  the true reason for Mr Cs regular and 
repeated borrowing.  From his bank  statements  I can see that he was spending large and 
increasing amounts  each  month on what appear to be online gambling transactions.  And he 
was funding this spending by borrowing from Sunny and a number of other short  term 
lenders. 
So I think proportionate checks, from loan 5 onwards, would have shown Sunny that Mr C 
couldnt sustainably  afford to repay  the lending he was requesting. So as a responsible 
lender I dont think Sunny should have  given him these loans. Sunny needs to pay Mr C 
some compensation.
Mr C has had the benefit of the money that he borrowed from Sunny. I think it is reasonable 
that I ask him to repay  the principal amounts that he borrowed. So in my redress below I will 
allow Sunny to recoup the outstanding balance of the money that it lent to Mr C from the 
compensation that it due to him.
Ref: DRN18629963putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr C after, and including, the loan that he 
took on 4 August 2016 (loan  5). So for each of those  loans Sunny should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr C on the loans.  
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Cs credit file in relation to the loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
As Mr C still owes some  of the principal  balance he borrowed  on his final loan, Sunny may 
deduct this from the compensation  that is due to him. To be clear,  that outstanding balance  
should be recalculated to remove  any interest  and charges,  but taking account of any 
repayments Mr C has made on that loan as though they were applied  against the principal 
sum borrowed.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Mr Cs complaint and direct  Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things  right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 February  2019.
