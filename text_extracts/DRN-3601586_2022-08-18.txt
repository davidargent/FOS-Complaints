The complaint
Mr C complains TransUnion International UK Limited havent updated his credit file when 
they should have.
What happened
Mr C says since January 2021 hes been raising concerns about his credit score being 
affected due to TransUnion not recording him as on the Electoral Roll (ER) when he says he 
is. He said hed raised multiple disputes, with some of those disputes being closed saying he 
hadnt provided proof of registration  when he had. Mr C also raised complaints, which he 
said TransUnion didnt reply to. So, he asked us to look into things in January 2022.
At this time, we asked TransUnion to respond to Mr Cs complaint. He later came back to us 
on 23 March 2022, and said hed not had a reply and wanted us to look into things. As the 
time TransUnion were allowed to look at the complaint had passed, we let them know we 
could start looking into the matter for him.
As part of this, we asked TransUnion for their file  and they provided a response theyd sent 
to Mr C after hed asked us to look at things on 23 March 2022. In this response they said 
theyd written to Mr C on 7 March 2022, but hed not replied with the evidence asked for  so 
they closed the complaint. 
One of our Investigators looked into things and felt TransUnion hadnt acted fairly. He asked 
them to update the ER information and pay £100 compensation. As part of this, we provided 
TransUnion with the ER information Mr C had previously sent them back in April 2021.
TransUnion replied and said as wed provided a copy of the ER information, theyd now 
amend that. TransUnion didnt agree to pay the £100 compensation. Because of that, the 
complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen in the evidence provided by Mr C that he did give TransUnion the evidence they 
asked for to record him on the ER on 7 April 2021. Ive also seen a copy of his credit file he 
produced in May 2022 for our Investigator, which showed TransUnion hadnt recorded him 
on the ER.
Based on the evidence I have Mr C was asking TransUnion to update him as showing on the 
ER on their systems for over a year. I think it could have been helpful if Mr C had provided a 
copy of the information again in March 2022 when TransUnion asked  but equally given this 
had been going on for a year and hed already sent it, I can understand his frustration.
I think TransUnion were under the impression this issue was limited to when we contacted 
them initially back in January 2022  so didnt think theyd done anything wrong because 
Mr C didnt engage with them as part of that complaint process. But the issue had been 
going on for a long time as explained by our Investigator both in his formal outcome and in 
several follow up emails. I find it very disappointing TransUnion didnt properly consider the 
evidence clearly shared with them to bring this matter to a timely resolution.
Ultimately, I can see Mr C did give TransUnion what they needed back in April 2021, and 
hes had to contact them on several occasions since. TransUnion have now confirmed 
theyre updating the ER  but given the timeframe and repeated failures of TransUnion to act 
fairly I do think £100 compensation is fair to recognise the impact on Mr C.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require TransUnion International UK Limited to pay Mr C £100 
compensation and update his ER information on their systems, so it shows on his credit file.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 September 2022.
