The complaint
Mr D complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA gave him more time to return an item 
that he bought which was counterfeit. Then it closed his claim without any further reference 
to him. Although he has now returned the item, PayPal still wont refund his money.
What happened
Mr D bought an item which he said turned out to be fake. He told us that this seller has now 
been removed from the auction site he bought the item on. 
Mr D asked PayPal to get his money back, and it said that it would repay him if he returned 
the item. But Mr D said that the country had just gone into lockdown, and a journey to post 
the item wouldve been considered non-essential. So he asked PayPal, and it said he could 
have longer to return the item. 
Mr D said he was doing the right thing by staying at home. He said that as soon as lockdown 
was eased, he returned the item. But PayPal had closed the case, and wouldnt give him any 
money back. 
Mr D said hed lost £129, and he wanted that back. 
PayPal said Mr D bought this item on 6 March 2020 for £129. On 12 March he filed a dispute 
with PayPal, saying that the item wasnt as described. On 20 March PayPal asked Mr D to 
return the item, and it would issue a refund. It asked Mr D to provide tracking details for the 
return by 30 March. 
Mr D asked for more time, because of lockdown, and PayPal agreed to extend time. It 
reviewed the case on 28 April, and extended time again. Then it reviewed the case again on 
28 May. Because it hadnt received any tracking information, it closed the case, and it 
emailed Mr D to tell him this. Mr D posted the item back to the seller the day after this email 
was sent.
At first, our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said he appreciated 
that restrictions were in place when Mr D first found out he needed to return the item. But our 
investigator thought PayPal had done the right thing by allowing Mr D extra time to return the 
item. It had allowed Mr D an extra two months, but Mr D only returned the item when he got 
PayPals email saying it had closed the dispute. 
Our investigator was satisfied that restrictions were sufficiently relaxed well before 29 May 
2020 so that Mr D could take the item to be posted. So our investigator didnt think PayPal 
had to do anything.
Mr D strongly disagreed. He didnt think that the fraudster should get away with it. And he 
said hed chased things up with PayPal, only to get an email out of the blue saying that his 
case was closed. Mr D said that if PayPal had given him any warning it was going to close 
the case, then he couldve returned the item.
Then our investigator changed his mind. He thought that PayPal shouldve got in touch with 
Mr D to tell him that it was going to close the case without a refund if he didnt return the 
item. Our investigator said hed seen nothing to show that Mr D was given any deadline to 
return the item. So our investigator said that PayPal shouldve given Mr D warning that his 
case was about to be closed if he didnt complete his return. Because it hadnt done that, our 
investigator thought that PayPal should pay Mr D £129.
Mr D agreed. But PayPal didnt agree. It said that our investigator had placed all of the onus 
on PayPal to remind Mr D that he had to return the item. It didnt think that should have been 
necessary. It had given Mr D an extension to return the item, then when the case was next 
reviewed on 28 May 2020, it was closed with no refund issued as PayPal had not received 
the requested information.
PayPal said that if Mr D could make the trip to post the item immediately after the case 
closed, then it thought he could also have done this a few days earlier. 
PayPal said it had extended the deadline as a goodwill gesture, so it didnt think it was fair 
for it to be in a worse position than if it hadnt taken this action.
Because no agreement was reached, this case came to me for a final decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator.
PayPal didnt think it should be worse off, because it had made a gesture of goodwill. But I 
dont think Mr D should be worse off either. And I think that at the moment, Mr D is worse off, 
because when PayPal made that gesture of goodwill, it also made a mistake.
If PayPal had said it wouldnt extend the deadline for returns, then Mr D would have been 
able to make an informed decision about whether he could return the item within the original 
deadline, or not. But instead it offered to waive this deadline. 
Like our investigator, I havent seen anything to suggest that PayPal had set any deadline for 
Mr D to send the item back. So Mr D felt he could wait until he was comfortable taking the 
item to be posted. He was unaware of any urgency in returning the item. 
I think it was unreasonable for PayPal to close this case without giving Mr D any deadline to 
make his return. I think that shouldve been done either when it first extended time for the 
return, or when it reviewed the case either the first or second times. 
I think that Mr D shouldve had some indication of when PayPal would decide that hed taken 
too long to make the return, before that decision was made. And on the evidence Ive seen, 
he didnt. For that reason, I agree with our investigator that PayPal should pay Mr D the 
£129 he spent on this item.  
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must pay Mr D £129.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or reject my decision before 5 March 2021.
