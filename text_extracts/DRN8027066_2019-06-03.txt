K821x#15complaint
Mr J complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid)  irresponsibly lent to him. 
He said the loans trapped him into a debt spiral, with the repayment  taking so much of his 
wages that he had to borrow again to cover his next months expenses.  Mr J feels  he should 
never have  been  given  these unaffordable loans. He wants a refund of the interest and extra  
charges he paid. 
background
QuickQuid provided  Mr J with fifteen payday  loans between  January 2015 and March 2018. 
He took out loans between £100  and £650,  sometimes topping up a loan with some 
additional borrowing. There  were  some gaps in in his borrowing. All loans were  settled.  
Heres a table setting out details of those loans:

Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Js complaint and thought loan 5, a second top-up on loan 6 and 
loans 7 through to 15 shouldnt have been lent to Mr J. 
QuickQuid disagreed so the complaint comes to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN80270662QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr J 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Js complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history  with Mr J to see if there was 
a point at which QuickQuid reasonably shouldve seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Thats when QuickQuid shouldve  realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
It seems  to me that Mr Js borrowing  fell into three  distinct  chains. 
Ref: DRN80270663The first chain started with loan 1 and ended with loan 5. Thats  because there was then a 
gap of just under six months before Mr J asked to borrow again. I think  that gap was long 
enough for QuickQuid  to be able to say that it looked like Mr Js finances had moved on from 
whatever situation  had required  his previous  loans. There was a further gap of almost seven 
months before Mr J asked  for loan 9. I also think that gap was sufficient to reset any 
concerns QuickQuid mightve  had about Mr J being  dependent on its lending.
I dont think QuickQuid was wrong  to give the first four loans to Mr J. Looking  at the amounts 
Mr J needed to repay, what was apparent about his circumstances  at the time, and his 
history with the lender, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid  to ask him 
for the amount of information that would be needed  to show the lending  was unsustainable. 
And there wasnt anything  in the information  Mr J provided or the information  QuickQuid 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
he was saying.  
But, looking  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids  lending history with Mr J, I think  by loan 5 
the lender should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful. This was the fifth loan that Mr J had taken  in the space of just over eight months. 
Mr J wasnt making  any inroads into the amount  he owed the lender. By then Mr J had paid 
a considerable  amount of interest to QuickQuid  to effectively service a debt over an 
extended period.  I dont  think he should have been given loan 5.
 
Following the break in lending, as before, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for 
QuickQuid to ask Mr J for the amount of information that would  be needed to show loan 6 or 
the first top up were  unsustainable.  So QuickQuid wasnt  wrong to give these loans to Mr J.
But when Mr J asked to top up loan 6 for the second time, just a week after his original loan, 
I think QuickQuid shouldve been concerned he was facing  serious problems managing his 
money. It shouldve looked  into his finances  in much  more  detail,  including  asking him about 
any other short term lending he was already committed  to repaying. Had it done so it would 
have seen that he owed a significant  sum to another lender. And similar checks at the time 
of loans 7 and 8 would  have shown that dependency continuing.  So I dont think  QuickQuid 
shouldve agreed  to give Mr J the second top up on loan 6 or loans 7 and 8.
Although there was another significant  break in Mr Js lending,  the amount he asked to 
borrow for loan 9 was the highest  amount he had taken to date. So I think it wouldve been 
reasonable for QuickQuid to have done  more checks  than simply asking him about  his 
normal income and expenditure. And better checks would have shown that he was still 
borrowing heavily from another short term lender and wouldnt be able to repay  this loan in a 
sustainable manner.
And it doesnt seem that Mr Js situation improved over the rest of the time he was borrowing 
from QuickQuid. The amount he needed to repay  on loan 10 was a significant proportion of 
his normal income. And, by loan 13, I think that QuickQuid shouldve  concluded that the 
lending history alone indicated that the borrowing was unsustainable.  I say this because:
Although there were  some limited gaps  between loans being  repaid and a new loan 
being granted I dont think it wouldve been  reasonable  for QuickQuid  to conclude 
these gaps were any indication that Mr Js finances had moved  on from whatever 
situation had required his previous loans. 
Ref: DRN80270664By the time Mr J asked for loan 13 hed been  borrowing  from QuickQuid for a lengthy 
period and he wasnt making  any inroads  into the amount he owed the lender. By 
then Mr J had again paid a considerable amount of interest  to QuickQuid to 
effectively service  a debt over an extended period.
I think that Mr J lost out because QuickQuid  continued to provide borrowing  from loan 13 
onwards when:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and top ups was likely to have had negative  implications 
on Mr Js ability  to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 5, the second top-up on loan 6 and loans 7 
through to 15 and QuickQuid should  put things right.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to give Mr J:
loan 5 (on 17 September 2015)
the second top up to loan 6 (on 23 April 2016)
any loans from (and including)  loan 7 (on 15 June 2016) onwards
So for each of those  loans  QuickQuid  should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information on Mr Js credit file in relation to loans 6 to 12.
The number of loans  taken before loan 5 and from loan 13 onwards means any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loan 5 and 
loans 13 to 15 should be removed from Mr Js credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN80270665my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Js complaint. CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) should pay Mr J as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 July 2019.
