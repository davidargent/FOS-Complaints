Mr O complains that the loans he had from MYJAR  Limited were unaffordable.
background
Mr O had seven loans  from Myjar between  August  2015 and January 2017 as follows:

7 30 Jan 2017 £1,000 366d £151.65 31 Jan 2018 5 Mar 2018
Mr O says he couldnt afford the repayments  on the loans,  so he ended  up getting  into 
further debt on credit cards and other  short-term  loans.  He says he sometimes  borrowed 
from friends and the loans  left him in a worse financial position.
Myjar says it asked  Mr O about his income and expenditure and used external data sources, 
including Mr Os credit  file, to assess affordability. It says that, based on the available 
information, it found the repayments were affordable.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He considered  that 
proportionate checks would have shown Mr O was having problems managing  his money  
when he applied for loan 3. He added that, by loan 6, Mr Os pattern of borrowing itself 
indicated hed become reliant on short-term lending. Our adjudicator  recommended  that 
interest and charges should be refunded on loans 3 to 7 (plus 8% statutory interest)  and that 
negative information  about loans 3 to 5 should be removed  from his credit file. He added that 
loans 6 and 7 should be removed from Mr Os credit  file entirely.
Myjar responded to say, in summary,  that it accepted our adjudicators recommendation on 
loans 3 and 4, but it believed loans 5 to 7 were affordable as there was a 5-month gap in 
lending between loans  4 and 5.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Myjar needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr O could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN54914142But certain factors might  point to the fact that Myjar should fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal the borrowing was, or was becoming,  unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Myjar was required to establish 
whether Mr O could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make repayments  
sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Os complaint.
Loans 1 and 2
Im satisfied that Myjar carried out proportionate checks  for these  loans and that there was 
nothing in the available information to suggest Mr O could not afford the repayments.
Loans 3 and 4
As Myjar has agreed to the recommendation on these loans I wont  consider them  further.
Loan 5
I accept there was a five-month break  in borrowing when Mr O applied for loan 5. But I dont 
consider that is long enough to assume  that he was no longer reliant  on short-term lending  
given his borrowing  history with Myjar. Instead,  I think Myjar should have carried  out a full 
financial review before approving any further  loans.  Such a review  would have  shown Mr O 
had a monthly loan repayment of over £200 which he hadnt declared,  and at least four other 
short-term loans outstanding. I find this indicates  Mr O was showing clear signs  he was 
struggling to manage  his money and Myjar should not have approved  his fifth loan.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Myjars lending history with Mr O, to see if there was 
a point at which it should reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Myjar should have realised it shouldnt have provided more  loans.  
Ref: DRN54914143Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Os case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. 
I say this because:
Mr Os sixth loan application came 15 months  after his first and that, in itself,  indicated 
that he was not using  the short-term loans for their intended purpose;
Loan 6 was approved just a week  after Mr O had repaid  loan 5 and it was for a higher  
amount. I think proportionate checks would have shown that Mr O had used loan 5 to 
repay other short-term  lenders so I find it likely  that the repayments  on loan 6 were  not 
sustainable for Mr O for a further  six-month term;
Mr O was provided  with loans 6 and 7 within days of settling a previous one. So Myjar 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr O was having to borrow  further to 
cover the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Os 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.  Indeed Myjars credit checks  showed Mr Os 
unsecured debt had increased from under £3,000  to over £13,000 between loans 1 and 7;
Mr O wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed Myjar. Loan 7 was taken out 
almost 18 months after Mr Os first. And it was for five times the amount. Mr O had paid 
large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Myjar over an extended period.
I think Mr O lost out because Myjar continued  to provide borrowing from loan 3 because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Os indebtedness  by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time;
the sheer  number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Os ability 
to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 7, as well as loans 3 and 4, and Myjar 
should put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. MYJAR  Limited should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr O paid on loans 3 to 7;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on refunds from payment date to settlement date*;
Remove any negative information  about  loans 3 to 5 from Mr Os credit file.
The number  of loans taken by loan 6 means  any information recorded about  them  is 
adverse. So all entries on loans 6 and 7 should  be removed  from Mr Os credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Myjar to take off tax from this interest. Myjar must give 
Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 February  2020.
