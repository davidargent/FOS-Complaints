K820x#14complaint
Ms B says Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) mis-sold her Additions,  Additions Plus and 
Additions Active packaged bank accounts.  Shes  used a Claims Management  Company  
(CMC) to make her complaint.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  at Ms Bs complaint  and didnt think Barclays had 
mis-sold the packaged  accounts. The CMC asked  for an ombudsmans  decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Ms Bs complaint. 
I think Ms B freely chose  to take the packaged  accounts. She actively  used some of the 
benefits such as the mobile phone insurance and preferential  overdraft  terms and couldve 
used some of the others  such as the travel insurance  included too. 
Equally while Im open to the possibility  Ms B wasnt provided with everything she shouldve 
been, I havent seen anything to suggest  clearer information wouldve changed her decision 
to take the packaged accounts in the first place.  So, in these  circumstances, Im not 
upholding the complaint.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Ms Bs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 May 2019.
