K821x#15complaint
Ms H complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to her in an
irresponsible manner.  Ms Hs husband, Mr H, is helping her to bring  her complaint.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision in May 2019, an 
extract of which is attached and forms part of this final decision. So, I wont repeat that 
information here. 
In my provisional decision,  I set out why I intended to uphold  the complaint  in part. I invited 
both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. Mr H, on Ms Hs behalf,  
said that she accepted my provisional  decision.  QuickQuid  said that it had nothing further to 
add. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that neither  Ms H nor QuickQuid have  provided me with anything further on the 
complaint, I see no reasons to depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional 
decision. So, for the reasons I set out, I dont think that QuickQuid should have given Ms H 
loans three  and four. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision, I uphold Ms Hs complaint in 
part. I now require CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid  to:
refund  all interest and charges Ms H paid on loans three and four;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans three and four from Ms Hs credit file;
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Ms H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off, if she asks for one.
Ms H didnt repay loan four and the outstanding debt has been transferred to a third party 
debt collection company. Ms H says shes been repaying the debt.
It seems reasonable that if Ms H still owes some  of the capital  she borrowed, part of the 
refund due to her should be used to repay that debt.  But to do so, QuickQuid must first take 
the debt back  into its own books and reduce it to reflect just the capital that Ms H borrowed. 
QuickQuid should  treat any repayments Ms H made to the third party  as reducing the capital 
that she owes.  Once it has recovered the capital Ms H borrowed,  any remaining 
compensation should be paid directly to Ms H.
Ref: DRN23046902If QuickQuid is unable,  or unwilling, to repurchase the debt within  four weeks of Ms H
accepting my decision, it must ensure that all its interest and charges added  to loan four,
and any other interest and charges  added  by third parties, are refunded  to Ms H so she can
choose whether  to use the compensation to settle her debt directly.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 July 2019.

complaint
Ms H complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid, lent to her in an irresponsible 
manner. Ms Hs husband,  Mr H, is helping  her to bring  her complaint.
background
Ms H took out four loans with QuickQuid between June 2013 and August 2014. She complains  about  
loans two, three  and four. A summary of the loans  is as follows and Ive included  loan one by way of 
background:
date Â£ amount borrowed No of 
instalments at outset date repaid
19 June 2013 150 3 13 September 2013 (late 
fee incurred)
215 February 2014 650 3 25 April 2014
310 May 2014 1,000 3 11 July 2014 (late fee 
incurred
49 August 2014 750 3
Ms H didnt repay loan four and QuickQuid transferred the debt to a third party.
Our adjudicator thought that QuickQuid shouldnt  have given Ms H loans one to four and she set out 
what it should  do to put matters right. QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicator. It offered to refund  
interest and charges in relation to loan four. Ms H didnt  accept QuickQuids offer. As there was no 
agreement between the parties, the complaint was passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general  approach to complaints about  short-
term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  - on our 
website.
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms H could repay  the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
    the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
    the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Ref: DRN23046904    the greater the number and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans  (reflecting  the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important  for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish whether  
Ms H could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable  on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow  this is the case. This is 
because the Office  of Fair Tradings  guidance on irresponsible lending and later the Consumer  Credit  
Sourcebook (CONC)  defines sustainable as being without undue  difficulties  and in particular, the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; 
as well as without having  to borrow to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender should  
realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing  
further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Ms Hs complaint.
When Ms H complained to QuickQuid, she said that she didnt  claim in relation to loan one and 
QuickQuid didnt address  loan one in its final response to Ms Hs complaint.  So, the first loan Im 
looking at is loan two.
Given what Ms H had to repay for loan two as against her stated income at that time and bearing in 
mind her lending history with QuickQuid at that stage, I dont think  it would have  been proportionate 
for QuickQuid to ask Ms H for the amount of information needed to show  that lending was 
unsustainable. There wasnt anything  in the information Ms H provided or the information  QuickQuid 
shouldve been aware of which meant that it wouldve  been proportionate to start verifying what  Ms H 
said.
The position  changes for loan three. Thats because the repayment for loan three represented a 
significant proportion  of Ms Hs income. So, there was a significant risk that Ms H wouldnt have 
been able to meet her existing  commitments without having  to borrow again. So, I think  its unlikely 
Ms H wouldve been able to sustainably meet her repayments for loan three  and any subsequent 
loans. So, I dont think QuickQuid should  have  given  Ms H loans three and four.
For the reasons  Ive set out above,  I dont think QuickQuid should have  given Ms H loans three 
and four. I think that Ms H lost out because QuickQuid gave her those loans. Thats because:
The loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Ms Hs indebtedness by allowing  her to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
The difficulty she had in repaying the loans was likely to have had negative 
implications on Ms Hs ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So I intend to uphold Ms Hs complaint about loans three and four and direct QuickQuid to put 
things right.
Ref: DRN23046905putting things right  what I intend  to direct QuickQuid to do
refund all interest and charges Ms H paid on loans  three and four;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information about loans  three and four from Ms Hs credit file;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must 
give Ms H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off, if she asks for one.
Ms H didnt repay loan four and the outstanding debt has been  transferred to a third party debt 
collection company. Ms H says shes been repaying  the debt.
It seems reasonable that if Ms H still owes  some  of the capital she borrowed, part of the refund due 
to her should  be used to repay that debt.  But to do so, QuickQuid must first take the debt back into its 
own books and reduce it to reflect just the capital  that Ms H borrowed. QuickQuid should  treat any 
repayments Ms H made to the third party as reducing the capital that she owes.  Once it has 
recovered the capital Ms H borrowed, any remaining compensation should be paid directly to Ms H.
If QuickQuid is unable, or unwilling, to repurchase the debt within four weeks of Ms H
accepting my decision, it must ensure that all its interest and charges  added to loan four, and any 
other interest and charges added by third parties, are refunded to Ms H so she can choose whether 
to use the compensation to settle her debt directly.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  given  above, I intend to uphold Ms Hs complaint in part and direct
CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, to pay Ms H compensation as set out above.
