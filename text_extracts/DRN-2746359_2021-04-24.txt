The complaint
Mrs G complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) placed blocks on her 
account, told various businesses she had passed away and cancelled direct debits out of her 
account.
What happened
Mrs G says she had a number of problems with NatWest in 2020 following it making a 
mistake by concluding she has passed away. She says direct debits were cancelled which 
meant she had to make payments herself and was no longer covered for a water leak 
problem. Mrs G says this caused her significant distress and inconvenience in sorting 
matters out and would like to know how NatWest got that information about her, and says 
the problems were not sorted out when NatWest said they were.
NatWest accepts making a mistake and has apologised. It cant explain what took place but 
accepts it gave a number of businesses incorrect information about Mrs G. NatWest has 
offered £150 compensation and says it will give feedback to its staff involved.
Mrs G brought her complaint to us and our investigator upheld the complaint and 
recommended NatWest pay a total of £300 compensation. The investigator accepted the 
mistake caused a significant amount of distress and inconvenience and that the problems 
took some time to sort out. The investigator didnt think Mrs G had provided evidence of the 
cost of the leak or why she needed to take professional advice from an accountant but 
thought NatWest had agreed to pay for the cost of the leak if a receipt could be provided.
Mrs G says the compensation offer doesnt go far enough for the distress she and her family 
were caused.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Having done so I have come to the overall view that I uphold this complaint but think the 
investigators compensation recommendation fair and reasonable.
There is no doubt that NatWest made a number of mistakes which I do not need to repeat. I 
have no doubt Mrs G was caused considerable distress and inconvenience and would have 
been concerned about where NatWest obtained the incorrect information from. I accept 
there will be unanswered questions about what took place and I appreciate what Mrs G 
says, that she is concerned about attending her local branch as a result of what took place. 
The key issue for me to decide is the level of compensation that NatWest should pay, and I 
make it clear to Mrs G that we are not NatWests regulator and so its not our role to punish a 
business. I dont think NatWests original offer goes far enough and doesnt take account of 
what took place after that offer was made. I think NatWest should pay £300 compensation 
which I think fairly reflects the level of the mistake and the impact it had on Mrs G. I cant 
consider the impact of NatWests actions on anyone else but Mrs G. I cant fairly order 
NatWest pay for Mrs G accountants costs, as I cant see any need for such advice on this 
issue and think that was Mrs Gs choice to take such advice.
I can see that Mrs G says she paid for the cost of the leak in her home due to the direct debit 
for such matters being cancelled. I have not seen a receipt for the cost of that but can see 
that NatWest has said it will pay for that, and no doubt Mrs G can provide that evidence to 
NatWest if she wishes.
Overall, I accept NatWest made mistake which had a significant impact on Mrs G and that it 
should pay compensation.
Putting things right
I intend to order NatWest to pay £300 compensation to Mrs G.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and order National Westminster Bank Plc to 
pay Mrs G a total of £300 compensation. Mrs Gs acceptance of this decision would be in full 
and final settlement of this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 May 2021.
