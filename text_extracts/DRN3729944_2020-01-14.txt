K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that MYJAR  Limited  (Myjar)  acted irresponsibly when  it gave him 
unaffordable loans.
background
This complaint is about nine loans Myjar provided  to Mr S between July 2015 and July 2017. 
Mr S took out loans  that were  due to be paid by way of 1, 3, or 6 monthly instalments. They 
have now all been repaid. 
Heres a table setting out details of those loans:

Mr S said that he was in a debt spiral  leading to repeat borrowing and that the loans werent 
affordable for him. He felt that Myjar didnt do proper checks and these loans made his 
already poor financial situation worse.
Our adjudicator upheld  the complaint in part. He thought that Myjar shouldnt have lent loans 
4 to 9 to Mr S. He set out what he thought  Myjar should do to put things right for Mr S. 
Myjar disagreed with our adjudicator and said the checks  it did were proportionate   and it 
wasnt certain that our adjudicator had looked at everything and he hadnt explained how 
hed come to his view.  
Myjar asked for a review  so this complaint comes to me to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN37299442Myjar needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Myjar should fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Myjar was required to establish whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. 
Loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication that a borrower could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being  without  undue  difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think he had enough  information to be able to say that loans 1 through  
to 3 shouldnt  have been provided. I have looked  through the information - and I agree with 
our adjudicator.
I think the amounts  that Mr S needed  to repay wouldve seemed relatively affordable  
compared with the take home  pay hed declared.  Given these repayment amounts, what was 
apparent about  Mr Ss circumstances  at the time,  and his borrowing history at that time with 
Myjar, I dont think  it wouldve been  proportionate for Myjar to ask Mr S for the amount  of 
information that would be needed to show the lending was unsustainable before agreeing 
the first three loans.  So Im not upholding Mr Ss complaint about loans 1-3.
But I think that by loan 4, Myjar should  have realised that Mr S wasnt managing to repay his 
borrowing in a sustainable way. I say this because Myjar could see that:
Ref: DRN37299443looking back at his borrowing history, there were indications that Mr S had struggled 
to repay  some previous loans. Hed taken out loan 2 barely  three weeks after he 
repaid loan 1  and he borrowed half as much again
 
he took out loan 3 the same day that he paid loan 2 - and loan 3 was for more than 
twice as much as loan 2 (and four times the amount hed borrowed when he started 
borrowing from Myjar)  
he took out loan 4 the same day that he paid loan 3  and he borrowed the same 
amount again  as the loan hed just paid
all this suggests to me that Mr S wasnt using these loans to provide a short  term fix - 
hed now been borrowing from Myjar over the course of 5 months 
it looks likely that Mr S had to borrow again  each time because  he was facing money  
problems after repaying each  previous loan.  
In these circumstances, I think there  was a significant risk Mr S wouldve been unable  to 
sustainably meet his monthly repayments  for loan 4  and any subsequent loans.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Myjars lending history with Mr S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Myjar should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Myjar  should have realised that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 5. Here are my reasons for saying this:
Mr S had by now been borrowing from Myjar for 8 months already  without  any 
significant breaks in lending  (I dont think the gap between loans 1 and 2 is enough  
for Myjar reasonably to think that Mr S mightve put his finances in order  during this 
period)
although loan 5 was for half the amount borrowed when he took out loan 4, this loan 
also followed the repay and then quickly borrow again pattern that hed relied  on so 
far  Mr S arranged  loan 5 to start the next day after he paid loan 6. This suggests 
that he had a need for ongoing  credit,  despite  the fact that Myjar had recorded  a 
slight increase in his take home  pay
this is borne out by the fact that loan 6 was for twice  as much as loan 5, and loan 7 
for double the amount of loan 6. By now, Myjars checks showed  that Mr Ss take 
home pay had gone  down a few hundred pounds. And although there  was some 
reduction in later loans after this, it doesnt affect  my overall  view that this pattern  of 
lending shows that Mr Ss borrowing was unsustainable and hed become dependent  
on this sort of expensive credit.
I think that Mr S lost out when Myjar provided  loan 5 because this loan had the effect of 
unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing  him to take expensive credit over an 
extended period  of time. 
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 4 onwards.
Ref: DRN37299444putting things right  what Myjar needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 4 from Mr Ss credit file
remove all information about loans 5 to 9 (inclusive) from Mr Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Myjar to take off tax from this interest. Myjar must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I uphold Mr Ss complaint about  loans  4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. 
MYJAR Limited (Myjar) should pay Mr S as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 February  2020.
