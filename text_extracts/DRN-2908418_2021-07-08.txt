The complaint
Mr A complains that Mercedes-Benz Financial Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-
Benz Finance, hasnt accepted the offers that hes made to repay the amount that he owes 
to it.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mr A under a hire purchase agreement with Mercedes-Benz 
Finance that he signed in January 2015. The price of the car was £26,750, he paid a deposit 
of £4,500 and he agreed to make 48 monthly payments of £279.39 for the car  and there 
was an optional purchase payment of £12,275.
He complained to this service that the agreement had been mis-sold to him because hed 
not been told about the optional purchase payment  but his complaint wasnt upheld. He 
kept the car after the term of the agreement ended but he didnt make the required payment 
to Mercedes-Benz Finance. 
Mr A sold the car for £6,300 in September 2020 and was contacted by a debt recovery 
service instructed by Mercedes-Benz Finance in November 2020. Some repayment offers 
were made by Mr A and in January 2021 he offered to repay £500 each month from April 
2021. That wasnt accepted so he complained to Mercedes-Benz Finance.
It said that his offer was rejected because of the amount of time for which the money had 
already been due and the fact that the offer was for payments not to start until April 2021. It 
said that negotiations had been ongoing for two months, a hold of one month had been 
given to him in November 2020 and hed been given information on organisations which 
could assist him in managing his financial situation.
Mr A wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. He says that the 
extreme levels of stress caused by Mercedes-Benz Finances behaviour led to issues with 
his wifes pregnancy and their child being born prematurely. He says that it should pay him 
£3,000 damages for mental stress and lack of compassion and the potential loss of his child. 
He also claims £1,000 damages for a fault which caused the cars engine emission levels to 
be too high.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He said that 
Mercedes-Benz Finance had given Mr A a reasonable amount of time but he was unable to 
afford a payment plan which would clear the arrears in a reasonable time - so he didnt 
consider that it had acted unfairly by rejecting his payment proposals. He said that he didnt 
have any evidence to show that Mr As wifes situation was caused by Mercedes-Benz 
Finances behaviour or that it had caused his child to be born early - although he appreciated 
that this must have been a very difficult time. He said that Mr A would have needed to raise 
his concerns about a fault with the car with Mercedes-Benz Finance so that it could 
investigate them and that he wouldnt be able to prove what caused the fault or who is 
responsible. 
Mr A has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr A signed the hire purchase agreement and agreed to make 48 monthly payments 
of £279.39 for the car and there was an optional purchase payment of £12,275;
when the four year term of the agreement ended Mr A didnt return the car to 
Mercedes-Benz Finance and didnt pay it the optional purchase payment;
he kept the car and continued to use it until he sold it for £6,300 in September 2020  
and a payment of £7,000 was made to his account in August 2020 which reduced the 
amount that he owed to Mercedes-Benz Finance to £5,820;
it instructed a debt recovery service which contacted Mr A in November 2020 about 
the outstanding balance of his account - some repayment offers were made by Mr A 
and in January 2021 he offered to repay £500 each month from April 2021;
that offer wasnt accepted by Mercedes-Benz Finance because it said that the money 
had been owed since January 2019 and under the offer he wouldnt start making 
payments to it for another three months  it said that it had put a one month hold on 
Mr As account in November 2020 and had given him information on organisations 
that could assist him in managing his financial situation;
its also put his account on hold whilst his complaint is being considered by this 
service;
a credit provider is required to respond to a customers financial difficulties positively 
and sympathetically  but that doesnt mean that its required to accept a customers 
repayment offer as whats appropriate in each case will depend on the customers 
individual circumstances;
Mr A hadnt made any payments to Mercedes-Benz Finance between January 2019 
and August 2020 and the offer that he made to in January 2021 was to pay £500 
each month starting from April 2021, three months later;
Mr A had been contacted by the debt recovery service about his account in 
November 2020 and hadnt made any payments to it by January 2021 and then 
offered the payments of £500 each month starting a further three months later;
I dont consider that it was unfair or unreasonable in these circumstances for 
Mercedes-Benz Finance not to accept Mr As payment offer and I consider it to be 
likely that it will now take further action, to the extent that its legally entitled to do so, 
to try to cover the outstanding balance from Mr A;
Mr A says that the extreme levels of stress caused by Mercedes-Benz Finances 
behaviour led to issues with his wifes pregnancy and their child being born 
prematurely  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
Mercedes-Benz Finance has acted incorrectly in these circumstances or that its 
action had led to the issues that Mr A has described;
I sympathise with Mr A and his wife for the issues that theyve experienced  it must 
have been a very difficult time for them but I congratulate them on the birth of their 
child  but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require 
Mercedes-Benz Finance to pay any compensation to Mr A for those issues;Mr A has claimed compensation for a fault with the car engines emission levels 
being too high  and the September 2020 invoice for the car refers says Emission 
level [too] high;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr A had complained to Mercedes-Benz Finance 
about an issue with the cars emission level before he sold it  and his complaints to 
Mercedes-Benz Finance and this service havent referred to that issue;
the car was sold by Mr A in September 2020, more than five and a half years after it 
was supplied to him, so its no longer available for inspection and Im not persuaded 
that theres any evidence to show that there was a fault with the cars emission level 
when the car was supplied to him or that it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
require Mercedes-Benz Finance to pay him any of the compensation that hes 
claimed for the alleged fault; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Mercedes-Benz Finance 
to accept Mr As payment offer, to pay him any of the compensation that hes claimed 
or any other compensation, or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 August 2021.
