The complaint
Ms B is unhappy how NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (NewDay) handled her request for help 
to recover money following the cancellation of her sons holiday.
What happened
On 23 October 2019 Ms B went with her son to arrange a trip abroad for him. They visited a 
travel agent, who Ill refer to as S. Ms B paid the deposit of £499 on her NewDay credit card. 
Her son was due to fly out on 29 February 2020 and return on 1 June 2020. He paid the 
balance of the trip on his own card. 
Before Ms Bs son was due to travel, the trip was cancelled because of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Ms B spoke to S and was in the process of obtaining a refund for the trip. 
However, S went into liquidation in August 2020 before the refund had been given. The trip 
was covered by ATOL, and Ms Bs son was able to recover his money. But ATOL redirected 
Ms B to NewDay to seek recovery of the deposit she had paid. 
As she was still without a refund of the deposit she paid, Ms B got in touch with NewDay on 
22 September 2020 to ask for their help. At this point, NewDay opened a dispute on their 
system and told Ms B that she needed to complete and return a dispute declaration form, 
which was sent to her. Ms B has said she returned this to NewDay.
Having not heard from NewDay for a couple of weeks, Ms B got back in contact with them. 
NewDay told Ms B they hadnt received her dispute declaration form, and she was out of 
time to raise a chargeback in line with the chargeback scheme rules. They sent her a letter 
the following day to confirm this. 
Ms B wasnt happy about this and complained to NewDay. NewDay responded and upheld 
Ms Bs complaint for service issues. They said she should have been told when she first 
contacted them in September 2020 that a chargeback couldnt be raised as it was out of 
time. They also said Ms B hadnt received a call back that had been promised to her. 
NewDay credited her account with £30 but confirmed the decision not to raise the 
chargeback was correct in line with the applicable scheme rules, which in this case were 
administered by Mastercard. NewDay referred Ms Bs claim to their Section 75 team, but 
they said she didnt have a right to claim under Section 75 as there wasnt a debtor-creditor-
supplier (DCS) relationship in place. Ms B had paid the deposit for the trip for her son, who 
was the contracting party, so Ms B didnt have a direct relationship with S.
Ms B brought her complaint to our service. Our investigator upheld it. She said she agreed 
with NewDays response in relation to any Section 75 claim Ms B might want to make. But 
she felt NewDay had enough information when Ms B first got in contact with them in 
September 2020 to raise the chargeback claim, and it would more than likely have been 
successful had they done so. She asked NewDay to refund Ms B the total amount of £499. 
She also asked for 8% simple interest to be added to that amount to reflect that Ms B had 
been without the money for some time. 
NewDay didnt agree with this. They told our investigator the chargeback would have been 
raised if Ms B had returned the dispute declaration form within seven days of receiving it. 
NewDay said they didnt take the chargeback any further because the form wasnt received 
 and by the time Ms B got back in touch with them, the time limit to raise a chargeback had 
passed. 
As NewDay didnt agree, its been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator here. I think NewDay had enough information 
when Ms B initially contacted them to raise the chargeback on her behalf. As I think a 
chargeback claim should have been raised, and would more than likely have been 
successful, I wont be commenting on the Section 75 element within this decision. Ill explain 
why I think this complaint should be upheld. 
There are different ways that a bank can assist customers who have had issues with goods 
or services not being provided. In some cases, a bank may be able to request a refund from 
the supplier through the chargeback scheme. This is a way in which payment settlement 
disputes are resolved between cardholders and suppliers/merchants. They are dealt with 
under the relevant card scheme rules and in this case thats Mastercard. In certain 
circumstances the process provides a way for NewDay to ask for a payment Ms B made to 
be refunded. Those circumstances can include where services arent supplied. 
There is no obligation for a card issuer to raise a chargeback when a consumer asks for one. 
But I would consider it good practice for a chargeback to be attempted where the right exists 
and there is a reasonable chance of success. 
In Ms Bs case I think NewDay misunderstood the relevant card scheme rules from the 
outset. Each chargeback reason has a code attributed to it. As Ms Bs sons trip had been 
cancelled, the code Goods or Services Not Provided would be the appropriate one for 
NewDay to pursue a chargeback against. The rules set out the timeframe for making a 
chargeback claim, as well as the supporting documents needed to allow a chargeback claim 
to be brought. The rules set out that a chargeback claim can be raised within 120 days of the 
latest anticipated delivery or performance date. In Ms Bs case, that is 120 days from the 
return flight scheduled for her son on 1 June 2020  which allowed her until 29 September 
2020 to raise a chargeback.
But within NewDays final response letter to Ms B and within their business submission to 
our service, they have used different dates to confirm when they believe the chargeback 
needed to be brought by. In their final response letter to Ms B in January 2021, NewDay 
have said she had 120 days from when her son was due to start his trip to raise a 
chargeback claim. But in their submission to our service, NewDay have said that Ms B had 
120 days from the date of the transaction with S in October 2019 in which to raise a 
chargeback  meaning she had until sometime in February 2020 in which to raise it. Neither 
of those dates are correct and both suggest a misunderstanding of the scheme rules.
NewDay have also said they needed Ms Bs completed dispute declaration form to raise a 
chargeback claim against the supplier. The scheme rules say that an email, message, letter, 
or Dispute Declaration Form would be needed to allow a chargeback claim to be brought. 
And the information needed to include a description of Ms Bs complaint in enough detail to 
enable all parties to understand the dispute. It also required a reasonably specific 
description of the goods/services purchased. NewDays account notes from the time of Ms Bs first telephone call with them state that Ms B wanted to raise a dispute against S (a 
travel operator) for £499 as they had now gone into liquidation. Im satisfied that was enough 
to meet the criteria for a chargeback claim to at least have been raised. Im also satisfied 
that, had NewDay been aware of the scheme rules as they should have been, they would 
have been able to get any further information required from Ms B at this time to raise a 
chargeback on her behalf. And, had NewDay made Ms B aware of the correct timeframe in 
which to pursue the chargeback, Im persuaded that any additional information required from 
Ms B would have been provided in time. 
Had NewDay acted as expected from the outset, I think the chargeback claim would have 
had a good chance of success, as it would have been difficult for S to provide a valid 
defence to the claim. They had cancelled the booking and had subsequently gone into 
liquidation. 
In NewDays response to our investigators view theyve said that the only reason the 
chargeback wasnt taken further was because Ms B didnt get the dispute declaration form 
back to them before 29 September 2020. Theyve said that, had she done so, they would 
have continued to raise the chargeback claim on her behalf. But, based on the evidence Ive 
seen from NewDay and the reasons theyve previously given for saying the chargeback had 
been raised out of time, I cant say that I agree with them. I think its clear that NewDay had 
misunderstood the timeframe for raising a chargeback, and irrespective of them receiving 
the form or not, they would have continued to tell Ms B she had brought the chargeback out 
of time. 
As Im satisfied NewDay should have pursued the chargeback claim with the information 
they had and should have been more aware of the timeframe explained in the scheme rules, 
I would normally now ask NewDay to look at raising the chargeback, provided it was still 
within the time limits specified by the rules. But it is now outside of those time limits, so my 
decision is that NewDay should reimburse Ms B the total amount of £499. Im also asking 
them to pay 8% simple interest on this amount from the date the chargeback should have 
been raised  22 September 2020  to the date this amount is settled, to reflect the fact that 
Ms B has been out of pocket now for some time.  
My final decision
For the reasons above, Im upholding this complaint. NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua must:
Refund Ms B the total amount of £499.
Pay 8% simple interest on this amount from the date the chargeback should have 
been raised  22 September 2020  to the date this is settled.*
*If NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua consider that theyre required by HM Revenue & Customs to 
deduct income tax from that interest, they should tell Ms B how much theyve taken off. They 
should also give Ms B a tax deduction certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the 
tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2023.
