K820x#14complaint
Mr I complains that NewDay  Ltd defaulted  his credit card account  and recorded  that default  
on his credit file. 
background
In April 1996 Mr I took out a credit card with NewDay, although at that time it was issued by 
a different company, which Ill refer to here as D. 
In around 2017,  Mr I changed his address, which he informed D of. He said he approached  
D about this as he was unaware that it was no longer his credit  provider.  Mr I says he 
received nothing from NewDay to show it had taken  over from D as his credit provider and 
this is why he didnt  communicate his change  of address with it directly.
NewDay continued to write and provide statements to the address it had on file for Mr I. It 
wasnt aware he had changed his address. And it said it had no reason  to think  its 
correspondence hadnt been received as nothing  it sent was returned undelivered. So, after 
Mr I had notified D of his change of address, he didnt receive  any further statements or 
correspondence from NewDay.
Mr I continued to use his credit card after he changed his address. And he missed all 
payments after May 2017, which was something that hadnt happened before.  So, on 17 
February 2018 NewDay sent him a default notice. And, in March 2018,  it terminated Mr Is 
credit agreement and transferred his account  to its debt recovery  unit. After this date 
Mr Is account was assigned to a debt collection company,  which Ill call L here. In July 
2018, L registered a default marker  on Mr Is credit  file.
Mr I says he was unaware of his account defaulting and the subsequent  default marker until 
he checked his credit file after an application  he made for credit was declined when he was 
purchasing a car. After that, he discovered that D was no longer his credit provider.
On becoming aware of what had happened  Mr I settled his outstanding balance  promptly. 
But he made it clear to NewDay and L that he was unhappy about the default being recorded 
on his credit file. He thought it was unfair given that he had told D about his change of 
address, settled his balance  promptly  and made  all payments on time prior to May 2017.
Mr I referred his complaint  to our service where  our investigator,  who looked into this matter, 
empathised with him. But they didnt recommend his complaint should be upheld. They didnt 
think NewDay had made an error  in defaulting  Mr Is account and they thought it had acted  
fairly. But Mr I wasnt satisfied  with this outcome and asked for his complaint to be referred 
to an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  While I sympathise with Mr Is situation, 
having considered everything that he and NewDay  have said, Ive reached the same  
conclusion as the investigator for broadly the same  reasons. I appreciate Mr I will be 
disappointed by this outcome. But I hope he can understand the reasons behind my 
decision.
Ref: DRN71521742Id like to make it clear at the outset that, while  L was also involved in how Mr Is outstanding 
balance was dealt  with, this complaint relates only to what  NewDay did. So, Ill limit my 
findings to whether it acted fairly  and reasonably  here. 
There are three parts to this complaint and I think it will make things clearer if I deal with 
them separately. 
NewDays decision to continue to write  to Mr I at his previous address
I dont dispute  that Mr I communicated his change  of address with D. But, while I sympathise 
with him that D didnt  pass  on this information to NewDay,  I cant  fairly conclude  that 
NewDay made an error in writing  to him at his last known address. Ill explain why.
Its clear that NewDay had no other way of contacting Mr I. It didnt have  a telephone number 
or email address for him. So, it had no alternative method to reach  him other than by post. 
NewDay says none of its correspondence to Mr I was returned undelivered and Ive no 
reason to doubt what it says about that. It may be that these letters  were  lost in the post or 
the occupants of Mr Is former address discarded post that was addressed  to him. But I cant 
fairly hold NewDay  responsible for that  nor can I expect it to have  known Mr I was no 
longer living  at the property.
Mr I says he received nothing from NewDay to advise that it taken over from D as his credit  
provider and this is why he didnt communicate his change of address with it directly. But, 
Ive seen copy statements  that NewDay provided,  which pre-date Mr Is change of address.  
Having considered these statements carefully, I can see they refer to NewDay  as being the 
credit provider of Mr Is credit card. The details of its registered address are recorded on the 
statement. So, I think information  about  Mr Is credit provider was made available to Mr I 
prior to the date he stopped receiving  statements. 
Mr I continued to use his credit card and was no longer receiving any correspondence about 
his credit card following a change of address.  In those  circumstances  I think it would have 
been reasonable for him to have queried why he was no longer receiving statements. I 
appreciate that he would have most  likely approached D to query this. However,  I think he 
would, most  likely, have been  told at this point that D was no longer his credit provider. 
So, for the reasons outlined above, I cant fairly  find that NewDay  made  an error in 
continuing to write  to Mr I at his previous address.
NewDays decision to default Mr Is account 
I know that Mr I feels it was unfair  of NewDay to default has account.  I accept what hes said 
about the default being inadvertent and without  malice. But, based  on the evidence Ive 
seen, I dont think it was wrong of NewDay to default his account. Ill explain  why.
When an account goes  into arrears for a number of months, as Mr Is did here, a business is 
entitled to issue  a default. As Mr Is account remained in arrears  for an extended period of 
time I think it was reasonable for NewDay  to issue a default notice and assign his debt to L. 
As our investigator explained guidance  from The Information Commissioners  Office  (ICO 
says it would expect  a default to be registered by the time a consumer  is six months behind  
with their payments.  Im satisfied NewDay acted in line with this guidance.
Ref: DRN71521743In Mr Is case, the last payment he made to his account before the default notice was issued 
was in May 2017.  Ive seen the correspondence  NewDay sent Mr I between  January and 
May 2018 telling  him what he needed  to do to bring  his account up to date and what  it could 
do to help him. By February 2018, when NewDay sent Mr I a default notice, it had been  nine 
months since his last payment had been received.  
In those circumstances I think NewDay was entitled to issue the default  notice it sent him. I 
can see this notice clearly  advised Mr I he was in arrears and in breach of his credit  
agreement as a result. It also told him how much he had to pay to bring the account up to 
date and what would happen if he didnt take action. 
Ive already commented on why Mr I didnt receive the letters  NewDay  sent.  And Ive 
explained why I dont think NewDay made  an error in writing to Mr I at his last known 
address. But, before  NewDay defaulted Mr Is account, Im satisfied it wrote to him on 
numerous occasions about his account  at his last known address.
In the overall circumstances  of this complaint, I cant say NewDay  acted unfairly when  it 
defaulted Mr Is account and assigned it on to L. This was done after an extensive history  of 
missed payments and was a decision NewDay is entitled to take if a customer  isnt meeting 
their contractual repayments.
The decision  to record the default  on Mr Is credit file
I know that Mr I feels a default has been unfairly  recorded on his credit file. I appreciate the 
default will remain on Mr Is credit file, and most likely impact him, until July 2024. I 
recognise that, as hes now retired, this is likely  to cause additional  detriment to him. Hes 
told our service hes already had a credit applications declined  as a result  of what happened. 
But, while Ive taken  all of that into account,  Ive seen  evidence here that the default hasnt 
been recorded NewDay. It told us its normal process is that once a debt is sold to a third 
party the default is registered on a customers credit file by NewDay. But that record is 
temporary and its removed once the debt sale process is complete. Its then replaced with 
information recorded by the third party that has purchased  the debt. Ive no reason to doubt  
what NewDay says about this process.
So, in this case NewDay removed the default it registered on Mr Is credit file after it 
assigned his outstanding balance to L. And, on 31 July 2018, L registered a default  marker 
instead. I appreciate  that Mr I settled the outstanding balance after L acquired  his account 
from NewDay. However, settling the account doesnt  remove the default from Mr Is credit  
file. And, as its been registered by L, Mr I will need  to take his concerns regarding the 
fairness any entries on his credit  file up with L directly.
I realise Mr I will be disappointed with this decision. But it brings to an end what  we, in trying  
to resolve his dispute with NewDay informally, can do for him. Im sorry we cant help Mr I 
any further with this.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 May 2020.
