The complaint
Mr K complains about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) unfairly charging him fees 
for transactions he has made using his credit card. 
What happened
Mr K says he noticed PayPal had been charging him fees on transactions he had made over 
the last four years using a specific credit card. Mr K looked into this and noticed on some of 
the transactions, which were to the same recipient, he had been charged a fee and on some 
he hadnt. So, he complained to PayPal. 
PayPal responded and explained when Mr K uses his credit card as the payment method, 
hes asked to choose who should perform the currency conversion. They said, for the credit 
card used by Mr K, the credit card company always charges in US Dollars. So, as Mr K had 
chosen PayPal to complete the conversion, a fee was applied. PayPal said the fees were 
outlined when making these payments. And, as Mr K chose to continue with the payments, 
he accepted the fees outlined. PayPal explained, personal payments may include 
conversions which result in a fee in line with the PayPal User Agreement. 
Our investigator looked into things for Mr K. She thought PayPal hadnt acted unfairly in 
charging fees. Mr K disagreed so the matter has come to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. I understand Mr K will be 
disappointed by this but Ill explain why I have made this decision. 
My starting point is the terms and conditions which a customer agrees to when using 
PayPals services. Ive looked at the PayPal User Agreement in place at the time and, under 
the heading Fees and Currency Conversion it says,
Where a currency conversion is required, it will be completed at 
the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange. 
The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a Currency 
Conversion Fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate 
applicable to your conversion
The transaction exchange rate applicable to your conversion may be applied 
immediately and without notice to you.  
Where a currency conversion is offered by PayPal to you when you make your 
transaction (e.g. at the point of sale), you will be shown the transaction exchange 
rate that will be applied to the transaction before you proceed with authorising the 
payment transaction. By proceeding with your authorisation of the payment 
transaction you are agreeing to the currency conversion on the basis of 
the transaction exchange rate shown.
Where your payment is funded by a Debit or Credit Card and involves a currency 
conversion by PayPal, by entering into this Agreement you consent to and authorise 
PayPal to convert the currency in place of your Credit or Debit card issuer.
Depending on the country you reside in and the type of Funding Source used for your 
payment, you may opt out of a currency conversion by PayPal before you complete 
your payment during checkout.
The PayPal User Agreement then includes a table of fees and this shows PayPals charge 
as 3.4% + Fixed Fee (charged in the currency in which your payment is received) The 
PayPal User Agreement does allow PayPal to charge a fee when carrying out currency 
conversion as part of a transaction. So, Ive then looked at whether PayPal have applied this 
policy fairly. 
PayPal say the credit card used by Mr K for the transactions are always charged in US 
Dollars. I can see from system notes provided by PayPal that is the case as, in a screenshot 
showing Mr Ks transaction, it shows the payment is charged in US Dollars. The system 
notes then show PayPal carry out a currency conversion into British Pounds and the fee 
charged being 3.4% of the transaction amount and a fixed fee of 20p. 
I can see Mr K has provided a list of all transactions over a 12-month period from January 
2018 to January 2019, to the same recipient, where he has been charged a fee by PayPal. 
Mr K says he used the same credit card for all those transactions. PayPal have provided a 
breakdown of their fees for each of those transactions. And, the fees are in line with the 
terms and conditions set out in the PayPal User Agreement. 
I can see Mr K believes PayPal have added these charges unlawfully and has referred to 
The Consumer Rights (Payment Surcharges) Regulations 2012 which came into force on 13 
January 2018 which prohibits firms from applying extra charges for a customer using a credit 
or debit card to pay for goods and services. I have carefully considered Mr Ks point here but 
I cant say PayPal have acted unfairly. The legislation Mr K refers to relates to extra charges 
being applied specifically because a consumer has used a credit or debit card. But, thats not 
the case here as the fee charged by PayPal is for currency conversion  which is a separate 
service and not a charge which is linked solely to Mr Ks use of his credit card as a means of 
payment. Theres further evidence of this as Ive seen information which shows Mr K using a 
different card for a PayPal transaction  and one which didnt require currency conversion. 
And, this shows no fee being charged by PayPal. So, I think the fee being charged by 
PayPal is for the currency conversion. 
I note Mr K says he doesnt believe any currency conversion has taken place and has 
provided a screenshot of a transaction which shows the payment details of a transaction in 
December 2018 which says PayPal fee -Â£66.66 GBP Mr K says this doesnt show any 
currency conversion taking place and he was led to believe this represents a standard fee. 
Ive looked into this transaction and Ive calculated this fee represents 3.4% plus the fixed 
fee of the amount paid by Mr K for that particular transaction. So, I think, on the balance of 
probabilities, this fee is for the currency conversion. I acknowledge Mr K says the lack of 
detail about the currency conversion led him to believe this was a standard fee, but I havent 
seen any evidence of PayPal describing it as such. And, the PayPal User Agreement does 
make it clear what this fee represents. 
Mr K says, because he believed the charge to be a standard fee, he was led to believe he 
would be charged a fee regardless of the card he used. Mr K says had he known this wasnt 
the case he wouldve used his other card for all transactions. I have seen details of a 
transaction at the start of September 2018 where Mr K isnt charged a fee. I believe, from the information Ive seen and the fact Mr K isnt charged a fee for this particular transaction, this 
wouldve been a transaction where Mr K used his other card. After this, Mr K then uses his 
original credit card again  and which generates a currency conversion fee. Over the next 
month, Mr K then alternates between the credit card and his other card to pay for 
transactions. So, I think Mr Ks PayPal account wouldve shown him that the transactions 
where he used his other card werent generating a fee but he still continued to use his credit 
card on other occasions.    
  
Mr K has provided a screenshot of a transaction in March 2021 which does show the 
currency conversion and exchange rate used by PayPal. Mr K says, because the other 
transactions dont show this, he doesnt believe any currency conversion took place. I cant 
say why this particular transaction shows the currency conversion and the others dont. It 
might well be that, since the other transactions took place between 2018 to 2019, PayPal 
have now changed their transaction details page to show the currency conversion. But, while 
I cant say for certain what the reason for this is, I have seen system notes for some of the 
transactions Mr K disputes, and this shows payments being made in US Dollars and the 
conversion into British Pounds. So, I think the currency conversions did take place for those 
transactions.     
I understand Mr K firmly believes PayPal have made an error here in charging him fees. But, 
from the information Ive seen, which includes the system notes and the PayPal User 
Agreement, I cant say they have acted unfairly in charging fees for currency conversion. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given, it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 November 2021.
