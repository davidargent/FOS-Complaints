The complaint
 Ms J complains about two loans provided to her by Madison CF UK Limited trading as
118 118 Money, which she says were unaffordable.
 
What happened
 118 118 Money provided Ms J with two loans. The details of these are given in the table 
below: 
Loan Date taken Amount Term Monthly 
repaymentTotal repaid
1 29/01/2015 £2000 18 months £185.77 £3343.86
2 04/12/2015 £3804.13 24 months £300.89 £7221.36
I can see that both loans have now been repaid.
Our investigator assessed the complaint and recommended that it be partially upheld. They 
said 118 118 Money had not done anything wrong when it agreed to loan 1. But they said for 
loan 2, 118 118 Money hadnt carried out proportionate checks and also did not make a fair 
lending decision based on what it had in front of it. They said this is because a significant 
amount of their income was being used to repay credit and wasnt sustainable. So, they 
upheld Ms Js complaint regarding loan 2.
118 118 Money disagreed with our investigators view about loan 2. It said the loan 
repayment was 25% of Ms Js total income with very little other credit to repay. It added that 
after loan 1 had been repaid, the outstanding balance of debt remaining was only £1042. It 
says the loan was affordable for Ms J.
So as this complaint hasnt been resolved informally, it has come to me, as an ombudsman, 
to review and make a decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
  I have also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry 
practice at the time.
When 118 118 Money lent to Ms J the regulator was the Financial Conduct Authority and 
relevant regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC).
118 118 Money was entering a regulated credit agreement. So, it had to carry out a 
reasonable assessment of Ms Js creditworthiness before it entered the agreement. This 
means that 118 118 Money had to consider both the risk to it that Ms J wouldnt make the 
repayments under the agreement when due, and the risk to Ms J of not being able to make 
these repayments. In particular, 118 118 Money had to consider Ms Js ability to make 
repayments under the agreement as they fell due over the life of the agreement, without her 
having to borrow to meet the repayments, without her failing to make any other repayment 
she had a contractual or statutory duty to make, and without the repayments having a 
significant adverse effect on her financial situation.
The rules dont set out any specific checks which must be completed to assess 
creditworthiness. But the lender should take into account the borrowers income (over the full 
term of the loan) and their ongoing expenditure for living expenses and other debts. Whilst it 
is down to the lender to decide what specific checks it wishes to carry out these should be 
reasonable and proportionate to the type and amount of credit being provided, the length of 
the term, the frequency and amount of the repayments and the total cost of the credit. So, a 
lenders assessment of creditworthiness would need to be flexible and what is appropriate 
for one person might not be for another. And what might be sufficient for a borrower in one 
circumstance might not be so for the same borrower in other circumstances.
In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed checks:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the longer the period of time a borrower will be indebted for (reflecting the fact that the 
total cost of credit is likely to be greater and the borrower is required to make repayments 
for an extended period).
Bearing all of this in mind, in coming to a decision on Ms Js case, I have considered the 
following questions:
Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks when assessing Ms 
Js loan application to satisfy itself that she would be able to repay the loan in a 
sustainable way? If it did, did 118 118 Money then make a fair lending decision?
 If not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown?
Loan 1 taken out by Ms J on 29/01/2015
118 118 Money gathered some information from Ms J before it agreed to provide loan 1. It 
asked her for details of her income and expenditure. It then carried out an assessment of her 
expenditure. It used credit search results to help it do this.
Ms J was entering into significant commitments with 118 118 Money. She would need to 
make monthly repayments for a period of 18 months. So, I think it was right that 118 118 
Money wanted to gather, and independently check, some information about Ms Js financial
circumstances before it agreed to lend to her. I think that the checks Ive described above
allowed 118 118 Money to form a reasonable view of Ms Js finances  I think that the 
checks 118 118 Money did for this loan, were proportionate.
But simply performing proportionate checks isnt always enough. A lender also needs toreact appropriately to the information shown by those checks. Those results might
sometimes lead a lender to undertake further enquiries into a consumers financial situation.
Or, in some cases, the results might lead a lender to decline a loan application outright. So
Ive looked at the results of 118 118 Moneys checks to see whether it made a fair lending 
decision.
When Ms J asked for loan 1, 118 118 Money calculated that Ms J would have had enough 
disposable income to afford the loan. There was also nothing on the credit search results 
that I think would have given it concerns. 
So, with what it had in front of it, I dont think the results of 118 118 Moneys checks should 
have led it to conclude, at the time it agreed loan 1, that Ms J was facing any problems 
managing her money. And its estimates of Ms Js disposable income suggested she could 
afford the repayments shed need to make. I think it was reasonable for 118 118 Money to 
give this loan to Ms J.
Loan 2 taken out by Ms J on 04/12/2015
I can see that 118 118 Money asked Ms J about her income and expenditure when she 
applied for the loan in December 2015. It then used credit search results to work out what 
credit commitments Ms J had and added to that what it thought her living costs would be.
118 118 Money used Ms Js declared income of £1200 a month. It then assessed her 
expenditure to be £610. It could see that Ms Js credit commitments were £160 before the 
loan repayment was added. It calculated that Ms J would have around £300 in disposable 
income after the loan was taken into consideration.
Ive carefully considered what 118 118 Money has said about how it calculated Ms Js 
disposable income when it agreed to lend to her. I dont think its checks were proportionate. 
This was now Ms Js second loan with 118 118 Money, and it was for a larger amount for a 
longer term. I think due to the size of the repayment, I think it would have wanted to carry out 
further checks to assure itself that Ms J would be able to repay the loan in a sustainable way 
over the 24-month term. I think it ought to at this stage looked to have carried out a complete 
review of Ms Js finances. 
As I cant see that this 118 118 Money did do this, I dont think that the checks it carried out 
before providing Ms J with her loan were reasonable and proportionate.
Did 118 118 Money make a fair lending decision?
Ive concluded the checks 118 118 Money carried out werent proportionate and that they 
needed to do more. But I dont need to look into what it would have seen if it had carried out 
proportionate checks, because I dont think 118 118 Money made a fair lending decision 
when it lent to Ms J anyway, based on what it had in front of it. 
I say this because when I look through the credit search results that 118 118 Money 
would have had in front of it, I can see that Ms J was already committed to credit 
totalling £160 a month. This was in relation to 3 hire purchase accounts and a 
delinquent utility account that Ms J was paying a monthly amount to.So, with the addition of the repayment from this loan of £300.89, in total Ms J would 
need to repay around £460.89 in credit repayments a month. This represented a large 
and significant part (more than 38%) of her income. 
I dont think at this stage, further credit commitment would have been sustainable for 
Ms J here. I think on balance, 118 118 Money ought to have realised it was unlikely 
that she would be able to sustainably repay her loan over the two-year term. And, in 
these circumstances, 118 118 Money should reasonably have concluded that it was 
not fair to lend to Ms J.
As Ms J has been indebted with a high amount of interest and charges on the loans that 
she shouldnt have been provided with, Im satisfied that she has lost out as a result of 
what 118 118 Money did wrong.
So, I think 118 118 Money needs to put things right.
Putting things right
  In line with this Services approach, Ms J shouldnt repay more than the capital amount she 
borrowed for the loan. With this in mind, 118 118 Money should:
add up the total amount of money Ms J received as a result of being given loan. The 
payments Ms J made should be deducted from this amount. Any payments made 
after the total repaid exceeds the amount Ms J was given should be treated as 
overpayments and refunded to her;
add interest at 8% per year simple on any overpayments from the date they were 
paid by Ms J to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information placed on Ms Js credit file because of the loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Ms J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
  My decision is that I uphold Ms Js complaint for the reasons set out above and require 
Madison CF UK Limited, to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms J to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2021.
