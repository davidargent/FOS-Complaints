DRN-3561009
The complaint
Mr D complains that PayrNet Limited blocked access to his payment account. The account 
was operated by an agent of PayrNet but Ill refer to PayrNet in this decision.
What happened
Mr D had an account with PayrNet. In December 2020 PayrNet contacted Mr D to ask him 
for information about the source of the money in the account, and to provide copies of 
identity documents, including photo-ID and a utility bill or bank statements.
But Mr D said that he didnt have photo-ID and  as he lived in shared accommodation  he 
couldnt provide utility bills. Mr D ultimately provided some information, and PayrNet said the 
account was under review.
Mr D chased PayrNet for a response later in December 2020  and again in January 2021 
after he opened an account with another business. He chased PayrNet again in March, May 
and June 2021.
In June 2021, PayrNet again asked Mr D for information about the payments  but this time 
included a list of acceptable documents where a customer didnt have photo-ID. Mr D 
provided information about a universal credit payment, a bank statement, and a copy of his 
birth certificate. Then in July PayrNet removed the balance from the account, which it says it 
intended to return to the source of the funds. It then emailed Mr D to say it wanted to close 
his account and asking him to complete a form to do so.
While all this was happening, Mr D complained to PayrNet and then referred the complaint to 
us. We asked PayrNet for its submissions in connection with the complaint  but PayrNet 
said it was having difficulties getting this information. Our investigator assessed the case 
based on what wed already received  and recommended the complaint be upheld and that 
PayrNet pay compensation. PayrNet didnt respond. The investigator referred the complaint 
to an ombudsman. An ombudsman asked PayrNet to provide its submissions or wed issue 
a decision based on the information wed already received. PayrNet then provided its file.
The case was reviewed by another investigator. Mr D had told us that the sender of the 
funds hadnt received them back. Our investigator concluded that PayrNet hadnt acted fairly 
in withholding Mr Ds funds, and thought the complaint should be upheld. She recommended 
PayrNet pay this amount to Mr D, and recommended PayrNet pay £300 for distress and 
inconvenience caused by the delays.
PayrNet didnt respond to the investigator. The complaint was then referred to me to decide.
Since then, Mr D has been in touch. He says that PayrNets agent has been in touch to say 
itll pay these funds to him within the next six weeks. Ive therefore reviewed the complaint 
afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Financial businesses like PayrNet are subject to a number of legal and regulatory 
obligations. These mean that they need to monitor customers accounts and may need to 
review accounts at any time. And while the review is ongoing, they may need to restrict 
access to the customers account.
Based on what Ive seen, I accept that PayrNet may have been acting in line with its legal 
and regulatory obligations when it initially blocked the account. That said, PayrNet asked 
Mr D for the information on 7 December, and Mr D replied  explaining that his ID 
documents were limited  on 8 December. Yet it wasnt until July 2021 that PayrNet finally 
closed the account and proposed to send the funds back to their source.
Weve asked PayrNet to explain these delays, but it hasnt done so. Based on what Ive 
seen, it seems likely that much, if not all, of this delay was avoidable. And although the 
investigator asked PayrNet for further details about its concerns, it didnt provide this either. I 
further note that, despite planning to return the funds to source in July 2021, this didnt 
happen. And PayrNets agent has now contacted Mr D and agreed to pay him this money 
directly.
With all this in mind, I cant fairly say that PayrNet acted fairly in withholding Mr Ds funds. 
And given the business has already agreed to release these funds, Im satisfied that Mr D 
doesnt need to provide further information.
Putting things right
Im satisfied that PayrNet didnt act fairly in withholding Mr Ds funds and caused him 
distress and inconvenience. For this reason, Ill be asking PayrNet to pay £300 for the 
trouble and upset it has caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that I direct PayrNet Limited to:
arrange for Mr D to be paid the £502.84, if it hasnt already
add simple interest (the rate is 8% a year) from the date they blocked the account 
until the date the funds are returned
pay Mr D £300 for the trouble and upset it caused
If HM Revenue and Customs requires PayrNet Limited to deduct tax from that interest it 
should provide Mr D with a certificate showing how this is calculated if he requires one.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 September 2022.
