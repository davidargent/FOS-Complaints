The complaint
Miss M complains that NewDay Limited, trading as Aqua, irresponsibly lent to her by 
providing her with two credit cards and by regularly increasing her credit limits.
I know that NewDay did not make the initial lending decisions in Miss Ms case. But it is 
responsible for answering the complaint. To keep things simple, Ill refer to NewDay 
throughout this decision.
What happened
Miss M initially applied for a credit card in November 2011. NewDay opened the first credit 
card account (CC1) with a credit limit of £600. A second account (CC2) was opened on 30 
July 2012 and a credit limit of £500 was applied to the account. The credit limits were 
increased several times up to October 2015 and at that point, each card had a limit of 
£8,000.
Between April 2012 and April 2013, Miss M requested and was granted five credit increases 
(three in respect of CC1 and two in respect of CC2). Between July 2013 and October 2015, 
NewDay increased Miss Ms credit limit on 11 occasions. Five increases were in respect of 
CC1 and six were in respect of CC2.
In February 2021, Miss M complained to this service. She said that NewDay should not have 
agreed to her having two accounts at the same time. She told us she had only made the 
minimum payments on each card for a long time and was using a high level of her credit 
limit. On that basis, she said NewDay should not have agreed to increase her credit limit.
Miss M said that if NewDay had checked her credit record, it would have seen she had 
missed payments, significantly increased her borrowing with other creditors and had 
defaulted on payments elsewhere. In a call with our adjudicator, Miss M said she was using 
her credit cards for essential spending, which NewDay would have known about. 
NewDay told us that every time it increased Miss Ms credit limit, it reviewed how she 
managed CC1 and CC2. It said it also considered external data provided by credit reference 
agencies. More specifically, it said its checks would have shown that Miss M had no arrears 
on her NewDay credit cards and that she was not in arrears with any other credit providers. 
She kept within her credit limit and did not routinely use her credit cards to withdraw cash. 
NewDay also said that Miss M did not have any high cost short-term lending accounts. She 
had made only one late payment to her NewDay credit cards.
Our investigator didnt think the complaint should be upheld. She said Miss M managed her 
credit well and NewDay did not lend irresponsibly.
Miss M did not agree with that view and the matter was passed to me to make a final 
decision. 
My provisional decision 
I issued a provisional decision in this matter as I thought the complaint should be partly 
upheld. I said: 
NewDay is required to lend responsibly. What that means is it must check whether 
Miss M could affordably and sustainably repay the credit. These checks would need 
to be proportionate. There is no set list of checks NewDay had to do. So reasonable 
checks in Miss Ms case would depend on a number of things, such as: what 
NewDay knew about her personal circumstances, how she managed her accounts, 
her overall credit limit and how much she would have to pay each month, which 
would include any new interest and charges shed have to pay.
The first thing Ive considered is whether the checks undertaken by NewDay were
proportionate. If the checks were proportionate, Ive looked at whether NewDay 
made a fair lending decision based on the information it had at the time.
CC1 was opened in November 2011. I havent been provided with a copy of the 
application Miss M filled out. Thats not unusual given how long ago the application 
was made. Businesses arent required to keep records indefinitely. NewDay says it 
would have undertaken a credit reference check. It looks as though Miss M would 
have been earning just over £2,000 net a month at the time. The initial credit limit 
was relatively modest at £400. And it doesnt look as though NewDays credit check 
would have indicated any financial difficulties at that point. From the information Ive 
seen, I cant say NewDay was irresponsible for agreeing to open CC1.
In April 2012, NewDay agreed Miss Ms application to increase her credit limit and a 
new limit of £1,300 was agreed. NewDay said it checked Miss Ms credit file and 
looked at how she managed her NewDay accounts. Miss M said that between 
November 2011 and April 2012, shed opened two new credit card accounts. But 
looking at the information NewDay had, I can see that she managed CC1 well at that 
point. Shed generally been paying more than the minimum payment, had not 
incurred late fees or exceeded her credit limit. The information didnt suggest she 
was behind with her other repayments. Overall, I think the checks NewDay undertook 
were proportionate and its decision to increase the credit limit at this point was fair.
CC2 was opened in July 2012. Miss M says NewDay shouldnt have agreed to her 
having two accounts at the same time. I dont think it was necessarily wrong of 
NewDay to agree for Miss M to have two accounts. But when it was making lending 
decisions, I dont think it should have viewed the new account in isolation. I think it 
should have had regard to both accounts when deciding whether to lend to Miss M. 
So when it received the application for CC2, I think it would have been reasonable for 
NewDay to consider what it knew about how Miss M managed CC1.
In accepting Miss Ms application for CC2, her new limit across both accounts would 
have been £1,800. I think it was proportionate for NewDay to consider the credit file, 
which again did not show any adverse information, such as a default. NewDays 
information didnt show that Miss M had any high-cost short-term borrowing. 
Although Miss M had used CC1 almost up to its limit, I think NewDay would have 
reasonably concluded that Miss M was managing her accounts well. I dont think 
NewDay would have seen anything to suggest Miss M was having financial 
difficulties.
At Miss Ms request, two credit limit increases were agreed for CC1 and CC2 in 
October 2012 for £400 and £250 respectively. Miss M applied for a further increase 
to CC2 in March 2013 and CC1 in April 2013. New Day agreed £500 for each 
account. When these increases were agreed, Miss Ms credit limit across both of her 
accounts was £3,450. It looks as though Miss M had three other credit cards and a 
bank loan. But I dont think there was anything to suggest to NewDay that she was 
having difficulty maintaining her accounts. And she appeared to be managing her 
NewDay accounts fairly well. I can see she paid a significant amount off CC1 in 
October 2012, and she was not at the limit in respect of CC2.
NewDay then applied a further increase of £750 to CC2 in July 2013. In November 
2013, NewDay increased Miss Ms credit limit for CC1 by a further £1,100. CC2 was increased by another £1,000 in February 2014. At this stage, I think it was again 
proportionate for NewDay to rely on the information from Miss Ms credit file. I think it 
would have shown shed opened a new credit card in July 2013. By this time, she 
would have been paying towards five credit cards and a loan. Again, the information 
doesnt suggest she was in any difficulty
with these accounts. She had not missed any payments and her credit file did not 
appear to show she was having problems financially. 
It follows then that up to February 2014, I think the checks NewDay undertook were 
proportionate and that its lending decisions in respect of CC1 and CC2 up to that 
point were fair. I know Miss M said that she some of her other accounts had 
defaulted and that she was using her credit cards for everyday items. Looking at the 
statements we have, I cant say she was routinely using her NewDay cards for 
essential spending. And I havent seen anything to suggest any of her accounts were 
in default up to this point.
However, in June 2014, NewDay offered to increase CC2 by a further £1,000. This 
would have brought her credit limit across both accounts to £7,300. By this point, I 
think NewDay would have seen that in just over 12 months, Miss Ms credit limit and 
indebtedness to it had doubled. She had been granted 8 credit limit increases in the 
space of two and a half years and each time, her indebtedness had increased. She 
had not made significant inroads into paying down what she owed for some 
considerable time. Miss M had not made more than the minimum payment for some 
months. I can see shed made significant transactions on both CC1 and CC2 
between February 2014 and June 2014 such that her outstanding balances were 
almost £6,000 before the increase had been applied.
At this stage, I think NewDay should have undertaken more thorough checks before 
it agreed to increase Miss Ms credit limit further. By that, I mean it would have been 
proportionate for NewDay to have discussed Miss Ms personal situation with her. 
The credit limit increase was offered on 17 June 2014. Had NewDay discussed Miss 
Ms situation at this point, I think it would have found out that Miss M had left or was 
about to leave her job. I can see from Miss Ms bank statements that she did not 
receive a full salary in June 2014. And she confirmed to our investigator that she did 
leave her job at around the same time. In those circumstances, I think NewDay would 
have seen she was unlikely to have any income with which to repay her credit card at 
that stage. In fact, she was actually out of work and without payments from work until 
September 2014.
NewDay offered a further credit limit increase in July 2014. Again, I think it would 
have been proportionate for NewDay to discuss Miss Ms situation with her before it 
offered more credit. Had it done so, I think it would have seen she was not working 
and so had no employment income. I think a discussion about her financial 
circumstances would have also shown that she had taken out a bank loan for 
£15,000 at the beginning of July 2014 and appeared to be using this loan, as well as 
assistance from family and friends, to manage her day to day essential expenditure. 
Had NewDay discussed the situation with Miss M, I think it would have concluded 
that the credit limit increases were not affordable, nor were the repayments 
sustainable.
In December 2014, NewDay increased the limit on CC1 by a further £1,300 and CC2 
by £1,200. This brought Miss Ms credit limits to £10,700. These limits were offered 
shortly after a late payment fee was applied to Miss Ms account. I think these 
increases were significant,and it would have been proportionate for NewDay to have 
a discussion with Miss M before agreeing to further lend to her. I think such 
discussions would have shown that although Miss M had a new job by this point, she 
was not paid the same every month and her income fluctuated. She was persistently overdrawn. She had taken out a new credit card in September 2014, which meant 
that she was making significant repayments towards seven credit cards. It appears 
that most of those cards were at or approaching the relevant credit limits. Miss M was 
also making repayments towards two bank loans.
In light of Miss Ms fluctuating income, when her credit repayments were taken into 
account alongside her rent liability, utilities and other essential expenditure, there 
may have been some months where Miss M could meet her repayments on a strict 
pounds and pence basis. But there were other months when that may not have been 
the case. NewDay had to consider whether the repayments were sustainable. By that 
I mean NewDay should have considered whether Miss M could make her 
repayments on time, along with her other reasonable expenditure without undue 
difficulties. If NewDay had discussed Miss Ms financial situation with her before 
offering further credit, I think it would have seen that due to her variable income, the 
December 2014 increases were not sustainable.
In April 2015, NewDay increased the limit of CC1 by £1,700 and in May 2015, CC2 
was increased again by £1,550. There were further increases in September 2015 
and October 2015. By this stage, the credit limit on each of Miss Ms credit cards was 
£8,000, or £16,000 in total. My provisional view is that these increases were 
substantial, and it would have been proportionate for NewDay to discuss Miss Ms 
financial situation with her before the additional credit was offered.
Had those discussions occurred, I think NewDay would have been aware that in 
addition to the seven credit cards, two bank loans and her persistent overdraft, Miss 
M was repaying £482.50 a month towards what appears to be a high-cost, short-term 
loan. Her income still fluctuated. Taking her income at the lower end of that 
fluctuation, I think NewDay would have seen that Miss Ms expenditure on rent, 
utilities and debt repayments was roughly the same as that income. That means she 
would have had very little left for other essential things such as groceries and travel 
to work.
I understand Miss M may have repaid the outstanding balances on both cards in full. 
I further understand that she was able to do this after receiving financial assistance 
from a family member. Whilst there may not be an outstanding balance as things 
stand, this does not change my current view that the lending was not sustainable at 
the point NewDay agreed to increase Miss Ms credit limits from June and July 2014 
respectively.
Putting all of this together, if NewDay had discussed Miss Ms financial situation with 
her, I think it would have concluded that she may have difficulty in meeting her other 
reasonable commitments. She wasnt making any inroads into her debts and her 
finances did appear to be under some pressure. I think NewDay would have 
concluded that Miss M could not sustainably make the additional repayments.
As things stand, I intend to find that NewDay should not have increased Miss Ms 
credit limits from June 2014 onwards in respect of CC1 and CC2. I intend to tell 
NewDay to take action to put that right.
I asked the parties to provide me with any further information or evidence they wanted me to 
consider before I issued a final decision. Miss M responded to say she would await the final 
decision. NewDay provided a brief response in which it stated that it continued to believe it 
acted fairly and in accordance with the relevant rules.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered the response from NewDay, I appreciate that it believes it acted fairly in 
this case, but it has not set out how or why it considers the reasoning in my provisional 
decision to be wrong. Neither party provided any further information or evidence for me to 
consider. 
In the absence of any further information or evidence and as no substantive response has 
been received from either party to my provisional decision, I see no reason to depart from 
my provisional findings. So for the reasons set out above, I partly uphold this complaint and 
require NewDay to take action to put things right. 
Putting things right
NewDay must take the following action:
rework CC1 to ensure that from June 2014, interest is only charged on the first 
£3,300 outstanding - to reflect the fact that no further credit limit increases should 
have been provided;
rework CC2 to ensure that from July 2014, interest is only charged on the first £3,000 
outstanding to reflect the cat that no further credit limit increases should have been 
provided;
if these reworks result in a credit balance on either account, this should be refunded 
to Miss M along with 8% simple interest per year calculated from the date of each 
overpayment to the date of settlement of the account. NewDay should also remove 
all adverse information recorded after either June 2014 on CC1 or July 2014 on CC2 
 or both depending on the result of these reworks.
or, if after the rework the outstanding balances exceed either £3,330 on CC1 or 
£3,000 on CC2 then NewDay should arrange an affordable repayment plan with Miss 
M for the remaining amount. Once Miss M has cleared the outstanding balance, any 
adverse information recorded after June 2014 on CC1 and/or July 2014 on CC2 in 
relation to the account should be removed from her credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to take off tax from this interest. NewDay must 
give Miss M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
I partly uphold Miss Ms complaint about NewDay Limited, trading as Aqua. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 December 2022.
