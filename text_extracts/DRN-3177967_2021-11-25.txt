The complaint
 Mr W complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA have failed to provide a refund for an 
item he ordered but didnt receive 
What happened
  Mr W purchased an electric bike, costing $599.99 using his PayPal account. Mr W then 
contacted the seller but couldnt obtain any further information to confirm the purchase or the 
date of delivery. When Mr W didnt receive the item or any contact from the seller for almost 
two weeks, he contacted PayPal who opened a claim as Item Not Received and considered 
Mr Ws claim under its Buyer Protection Policy.
PayPal contacted the seller and was provided with screenshots of the purchase, Mr Ws 
delivery address and a postal service tracking number which also showed the date the item 
had been delivered. Mr W was also given the same tracking number from the seller during 
this time.
Mr W contacted the postal service and has provided evidence that the item attached to the 
tracking number was delivered but to a different name and address and the postal service 
confirmed the item fit through a letter box  so couldnt have been an electric bike.
PayPal rejected Mr Ws claim saying the seller had shown both proof of shipment and proof 
of delivery, therefore meeting its criteria for proof of delivery under its terms and conditions.
 
In summary PayPal referred to its terms and conditions which say:
-Please note that as clearly outlined in our User Agreement your claim will not qualify for a refund 
under PayPal Buyer Protection for an Item Not Received claim, if:
You collect the item in person, or arrange for it to be collected on your behalf, including if you use PayPal in a 
seller's retail point of sale, except for in-person PayPal QR code goods and services transactions. 
The seller has provided proof of delivery. 
-If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, PayPal may find in favour of the 
seller for an Item Not Received claim even if you claim you did not receive the goods.
Unhappy with the outcome from PayPal, Mr W brought his complaint to our service. One of 
our investigators looked into things and said he didnt think PayPal had applied its Buyer 
Protection Policy fairly. He said the evidence from the seller didnt show that the item was 
posted to Mr W and didnt think it met PayPals own criteria for proof of delivery for that 
reason.
He said whilst there was a delivered status on the sellers evidence from the postal service, 
it didnt show the recipients address. Mr Ws evidence from the postal service should have 
raised concerns with PayPal and he found it persuasive in concluding Mr W didnt receive 
the item.
  
PayPal didnt agree, maintaining that it considered the sellers proof of shipment and delivery 
met its User Agreement and Buyer Protection Policy. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 In doing so, Im also upholding Mr Ws claim against PayPal. Ill explain why. 
While I agree PayPals terms are clear, the evidence from the seller isnt the only evidence 
PayPal received. Having been told by PayPal that the seller had provided a tracking number 
which showed Mr Ws item had been delivered, Mr W contacted the postal service and was 
told the parcel hadnt been delivered to his address and couldnt have been an electric bike 
because of the size and weight of the item. 
PayPal stood by its decision to close Mr Ws claim, even after he provided this further 
evidence from the postal service. The guidance PayPal says it followed refers only to 
evidence from the seller. But it must be the case that if PayPal is going to rely on evidence 
provided by the seller, that evidence must be valid. The evidence from the seller doesnt 
establish that the item was delivered to Mr Ws address. It only shows a delivery address 
and a delivered status from the postal service. In this case Mr W has provided compelling 
evidence that the parcel, related to the tracking number the seller provided, wasnt delivered 
to his address and couldnt have been the item he purchased - given its size and weight. Im 
satisfied that this evidence invalidates the sellers evidence and ought to have been 
considered by PayPal as such. Overall, I dont think PayPal acted fairly in declining Mr Ws 
claim under its Buyer Protection Policy and it should refund Mr W his loss.
Putting things right
I uphold Mr Ws complaint and to put things right I require PayPal to refund Mr Ws losses as 
follows
-Refund Mr W the $599.99 
-Pay interest on this sum at 8% simple from the date the payment was originally made 
until payment is made to Mr W.
My final decision
 I uphold Mr Ws complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 December 2021.
