The complaint
Mr S complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, trading as Barclaycard, wont refund to him the 
money that he paid for a holiday club membership. Hes being represented in his complaint 
by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr S and his wife entered into a contract in December 2018 to buy a holiday club 
membership. The purchase price was $18,241.38 and administrative expenses of $2,362.07 
and taxes of $3,296.55 were also payable. Mr S paid the down payment of $7,170 and the 
closing costs of $424 using his Barclaycard credit card and he and his wife agreed to pay the 
balance of $16,730 by 36 monthly payments of $469.72. 
Mr Ss representative made claims to Barclaycard in March 2019 under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 that the membership had been mis-sold to Mr S and his wife as 
an investment and that the holiday company had breached the Consumer Protection from 
Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 and other regulations. It then sent a letter before action to 
Barclaycard in September 2019 in which it made claims under sections 75 and 140A of the 
Consumer Credit Act. It said that Barclaycard was jointly and severally liable for the 
negligent misrepresentations and/or breaches of contract by the holiday company. It also 
said that the terms of the contract and the misleading actions and omissions and the 
aggressive sales practices of the holiday company had created an unfair relationship 
between Barclaycard and Mr S. It said that at no stage prior to entering into the finance 
agreement was any proper assessment done to assess Mr Ss creditworthiness.
Barclaycard said that, based on the correspondence that  it had received, there was no proof 
to uphold Mr Ss claim. Mr S wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to 
this service. Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld as she 
didnt think that Barclaycards decision to turn down his claims was unfair or unreasonable. 
She recognised that Mr S had concerns about the way in which the membership was sold 
but she wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale. She said 
that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr S and Barclaycard 
was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the 
relationship was unfair. She also said that Mr S had used a credit card with an existing credit 
limit large enough to help him finance his purchase so she didnt think that Barclaycard was 
under any obligation to carry out the checks that his representative suggested that it should 
have.
Mr Ss representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, 
that:
the contract is also a finance agreement and Mr S and his wife were asked to sign it 
on the day, with no possibility of escaping it and there was no cancellation policy in 
place;
theres no breakdown or explanation of the term and the total to be paid;
no credit check was done on Mr Ss ability to pay;
Mr S and his wife believed that they would have access to all of the resorts 
advertised;
they werent informed of the extra charges that were payable;
the information about costs and fees is so small as to be unreadable and Mr S and 
his wife werent able to make an informed decision about the ongoing costs of the 
membership;
Mr S and his wife provided the holiday company with notice that they wished to 
cancel the contract within five working days from the delivery of, or the signing of, the 
contract and returned all the contracts and documents to the holiday company;
the vacation package that they received didnt contain the same quality and 
specifications offered to them at the sales presentation and/or listed in the contract;
they purchased the membership as an investment that would provide a 20% return 
as theyd been told that the units would rent out easily and they were provided with a 
list of brokers that rent out the units; and
the vacation package contains terms and conditions never previously disclosed to 
Mr S and his wife.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ss complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Ss claims were made under sections 75 and 140A  section 75 gives a consumer 
an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of 
credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
(provided that certain criteria set out in that section are met) and section 140A gives 
a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid 
by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair 
relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclaycards response to 
Mr Ss claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr Ss claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company and that the membership was misrepresented to him and his wife and that 
they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them;
Mr S and his wife signed documents in December 2018 including the contract, the 
terms and conditions, a disclosure statement and a members information document 
and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that their membership 
includes terms and conditions never previously disclosed to them;
the contract says that Mr S and his wife agreed to buy a right to use a membership 
that allows them to use and occupy a studio unit for one week during the prime 
season with capacity for two people for a period of 25 years with annual use at a 
hotel;
the contract also says that Mr S and his wife would make 36 monthly payments of 
$469.72 to the holiday company and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company acted incorrectly in connection with that 
arrangement;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the membership isnt available for Mr S and his 
wife to use and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres 
been a breach of contract by the holiday company;
Mr Ss representative says that Mr S and his wife should have had five days in which 
to cancel the contract and that they provided the holiday company with notice that 
they wished to cancel it within five working days  but Ive seen no other evidence to 
show that Mr S and his wife contacted the holiday company to cancel the contract 
and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they had a right to 
cancel the contract within five working days;
Mr Ss representatives September 2019 letter to Barclaycard said that, after Mr S 
and his wife returned home and looked at a link to the holiday companys website, it 
showed 14 locations in Europe but none in Portugal  and there was no reference in 
that letter or the March 2019 to Mr S and his wife having given notice to cancel the 
contract;
Mr Ss representatives response to our investigators recommendation says that the 
vacation package that Mr S and his wife received didnt contain the same quality and 
specifications offered to them at the sales presentation and/or listed in the contract  
but if Mr S and his wife had cancelled the contract they wouldnt have been using 
their membership, and no other information has been provided to show that the 
accommodation isnt of the same quality and specification as described in the sales 
presentation and contract;
the disclosure statement that was signed by Mr S and his wife says that the 
membership can be used in any of the holiday companys affiliated properties but Ive 
seen no evidence to show that the holiday company represented to Mr S and his wife 
that they would be able to use the membership for holidays in Portugal (and, if 
holidays in Portugal were important to them, I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect them to have checked the information about use in Portugal before they 
signed the contract) or that theyve not been able to use their membership to access 
all of the resorts advertised;
the documents that Mr S and his wife signed describe the charges that would be 
payable and Ive seen no evidence to show that theyve been asked to pay charges 
that arent described in those documents  some of the information about costs and 
fees is in a small font but I consider that its legible and, if Mr S and his wife couldnt 
read it, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have asked for a 
copy that they could read;
Mr Ss representative says that Mr S and his wife purchased the membership as an 
investment that would provide a 20% return as theyd been told that the units would 
rent out easily and they were provided with a list of brokers that rent out the units - 
but the disclosure statement says: We understand that we are purchasing this 
Membership based on its value as a vacation experience and for spending leisure 
time and not with any expectation of deriving any profit; and: We understand that 
we can rent or sell our Membership but with no expectation to receive assistance 
from the Developer  The Developer does not have any agreement with any 
company that offers rental or resale services ;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership was 
represented to Mr S and his wife by the holiday company as an investment, that it 
was misrepresented to them in any way, that it was mis-sold to them or that they 
were induced into entering into the contract by any misrepresentations;Mr Ss representative says that no credit check was done on Mr Ss ability to pay  
but he used his Barclaycard credit card to make a payment of £6,190.34 to the 
holiday company and his credit card statement shows that he had a credit limit of 
£16,000 so Im not persuaded that there was any requirement for Barclaycard to 
make any further checks as a result of the payment that Mr S made to the holiday 
company;
Ive been provided with copies of Mr Ss credit card statements for January to August 
2019 and its clear that Mr S was using his credit card during that period, Ive seen no 
evidence to show that he couldnt afford the credit and, in all but one of those 
months, he cleared the balance without incurring any interest or charges;
the contract also provided for Mr S and his wife to make 36 monthly payments of 
$469.72 to the holiday company but that was an arrangement that Mr S and his wife 
made with the holiday company and Barclaycard wasnt involved in that arrangement 
so wouldnt have been able to make any checks in relation to it;
Im not persuaded that that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday 
company used misleading actions and omissions on Mr S and his wife or that it used 
aggressive sales practices against them  they signed a document which listed three 
principal reasons that theyd purchased their membership and one of the reasons 
that they gave was the salespersons professional and friendly manner;
Im not persuaded that the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 
2008 and the other regulations to which Mr Ss representative has referred would 
apply to the contract and nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that Barclaycard has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr S; 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Ss relationship with 
Barclaycard was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude 
that there was an unfair relationship between Mr S and Barclaycard in these 
circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr S and his wife for the issues that theyve have had with their 
membership but I consider that Barclaycards response to Mr Ss claims was fair and 
reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclaycard to refund to Mr S any of the money that hes paid for the membership, to 
pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 July 2023.
