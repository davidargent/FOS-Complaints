K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains about how Exeter  Friendly Society  Limited dealt with a claim against his
private medical insurance policy.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision of 
23 December 2019, an extract  of which is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I 
wont repeat  that information here.  
my provisional decision
In my provisional decision,  I explained  why I thought that Exeter hadnt handled Mr Ws claim 
entirely fairly  and what I thought it should do to put matters right.  
responses to my provisional  decision
Mr W and Exeter  accepted my provisional  decision. Mr W made some further comments 
which, in summary, are:
Its inconsistent to say i) Exeter  is right that its only once a period of 24 hours has 
passed that its definition of a Day  is met and ii) day one ends at 1pm on 6 January 
2019. 
Exeter treated him unfairly  as it misinterpreted its own rules.  
Exeter told him that day one begins  at 00.01 hours on the calendar day after 
admission.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As I said in my provisional decision,  I think theres  been confusion here. As Exeter is the 
expert, wed expect it to get this right. I think the definition of a Day  Exeter set out in its final 
response to Mr W was confusing. That definition also differs from the one Exeter used in its 
later exchanges, notably  its later letter to Mr W of 11 March 2019, from which I quoted  the 
table. I think the confusion about a Day  starting at 00.01 hours on the day after admission 
was part of the general confusion in this case.  
I dont think its inconsistent to say that Exeter is right to say that its only once a period of 24 
hours has passed that its definition of a Day is met and that, in this case, day one ends at 
1pm on 6 January   that is, 24 hours after Mr W was admitted to hospital.  
Ive noted what  Mr W says.  Im pleased that both parties have agreed to accept my 
provisional decision. So, I see no reason to depart from the conclusions  I previously 
reached. For the reasons  Ive explained,  I dont think that Exeter  handled Mr Ws claim 
entirely fairly. To put things right,  Exeter should  pay Mr W £928.19, which  is part of the 
charges Mr W incurred.  As Ive said, its then for Mr W to settle the outstanding  invoice  with 
the hospital.  
Ref: DRN95839282my final decision
For the reasons  Ive set out above  and in my provisional decision, I uphold  Mr Ws 
complaint. I now require Exeter Friendly  Society  Limited to pay Mr W £928.19. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 February  2020.

complaint
Mr W complains  about how Exeter Friendly Society Limited dealt with a claim  against his private  
medical insurance policy.
background
On 5 January  2019, Mr W was admitted to hospital as an emergency. On 7 January 2019,
Mr W contacted Exeter and notified it of his claim. Exeter said that Mr Ws policy didnt  cover the first 
five days  of treatment after an emergency admission. It said that Mr W may be able to transfer to the 
NHS, rather than incur costs  not covered by his policy. Mr W didnt want to do that.
Exeter says that the policy defines Day as a period of 24 hours.  So, it doesnt count
5 January 2019, as Mr W hadnt been in hospital for 24 hours  on that day. Exeter says that day one 
of Mr Ws stay in hospital was 6 January  2019, so benefit  started  on day six, which  is 11 January 
2019. Exeter paid the invoice from the hospital for 11 January 2019, which  amounted to £1,644.97. 
The hospital  sent Mr W an invoice for £7,181.25.  Mr W paid £5,000, leaving a balance of £2,181.25.
Essentially, Mr W says that theres no justification for ignoring the period  he was in hospital on 5 
January 2019. He says that the first 24 hour period started at the time of his admission  at 1pm on 5 
January 2019 and the sixth period of 24 hours started at 1pm on
10 January 2019. Mr W wants Exeter to pay the charges arising from 1pm on
10 January 2019. He says that Exeter has underpaid by approximately £1,200.
One of our investigators looked at what had happened. She said initially that Exeter should count  5 
January 2019 as day one and pay for the day that wasnt in its original calculation  day seven.
Exeter didnt agree  with the investigator. It said that it calculates day one once  a period of
24 hours has passed.
The investigator looked  at the matter again and changed her view. She said that
6 January 2019 was day one, 24 hours after Mr W was admitted. The investigator said that benefit  is 
payable on day six, which is 11 January  2019 and that Exeter had paid the invoice  relating to that 
date. She was satisfied that Exeter had paid what the hospital had asked it to pay.
Mr W didnt accept the investigators view. There was an exchange  of e-mail correspondence, 
which I wont repeat  here but in which Mr W made his argument that day six of his admission 
started after 1pm on 10 January 2019. He said that Exeter should pay for the night of his stay on 
10 January 2019, in addition  to the night  of 11 January 2019, which it had already paid.
As there was no agreement between the parties, the complaint was passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN95839284I think theres  been confusion here and that theres more  common ground between  the parties 
than first appears.
the relevant policy terms and conditions
The starting  point is the terms and conditions of the policy,  which include the following:
8. What is not covered
[]
(k) Emergency  admissions  and any subsequent related treatment or readmission  within
5 days of an emergency admission (the date and time will be obtained  from the records of the 
admitting hospital) Please note [] benefits  for eligible conditions become available  on day 6
Day
A period of 24 hours.
has the claim been handled fairly?
The relevant rules  and industry guidance  say that Exeter has a responsibility  to handle claims  
promptly and fairly and it shouldnt  reject a claim unreasonably.
I dont think that Exeter has handled Mr Ws claim entirely fairly. Ill explain why:
In its response  to the investigators initial view, Exeter says under our policy terms the first 
day in hospital  is not counted  as day 1, its only once a period of 24 hours has passed  that the 
member would meet  our definition  of a day.  (sic). I think thats  right.
As Mr W was admitted at 1pm on 5 January  2019,  day 1 ends at 1pm on
6 January 2019. I think that the table set out in Exeters letter of 11 March 2019, is helpful 
and I reproduce it here.
Sat 5 Sun 6 Mon 7 Tues 8 Weds 9Thurs 10 Fri 11 Sat 12
1 00pm 1 00pm 1 00pm 1 00pm 1.00pm 1 00pm 1 00pm 1 00pm
Day 0 Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 Day 6 Day 7
    Day five ends at 1pm on 10 January 2019 and day six begins at 1.01pm on
10 January 2019. So, Exeter should pay for eligible costs  incurred by Mr W from
1.01pm on 10 January  2019.
    The hospital has billed Exeter separately for room, care, treatment and tests for
11 January 2019, which Exeter has paid. 
I think  Exeter should also pay for eligible treatment and care incurred after 1.01pm on 10 
January 2019. The difficulty is that the hospital  hasnt  set out its invoice  in a way that helps 
me to determine exactly what those  costs are. I suspect that may be because  Exeter asked 
the hospital to bill it separately only from 11 January 2019, which  wasnt in fact correct.
Insurers generally have agreements with hospitals about  the level of charges.  So, the invoice 
direct to Mr W is more than Exeter  would pay for the same services. If Exeter had correctly  
asked the hospital to bill it separately from 1.01 on 10 January  2019, it would  have been 
charged at lower rates.  But I dont think that Mr W should  lose out because  of that.
Ref: DRN95839285I think  that a fair resolution here is for Exeter to pay Mr W 1/6 of the room and care charges on 
the invoice addressed to him dated 21 January 2019 (£4128/6 = £688). It should  also pay part 
of some of the other charges in that invoice.
Based on the information I have, its impossible to determine exactly which  charges were 
incurred after 1.01 pm on 10 January 2019 but before  the invoice direct to Exeter for 11 
January 2019. I think its more  likely than not that most  of the charges  would have been 
incurred in the first five days of Mr Ws care in hospital, before  Exeter was liable to pay them. I 
think a fair resolution is for Exeter  to pay Mr W 1/12 of the costs for pathology, histology and 
drugs set out in the invoice to Mr W (£2,882.25/12  = £240.19).
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  Ive set out above,  I intend to uphold Mr Ws complaint.  I intend to direct Exeter 
Friendly Society Limited to pay Mr W £928.19.  Its then for Mr W to settle the outstanding invoice  
with the hospital.
