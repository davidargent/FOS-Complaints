DRN-1229558
The complaint
Miss N complains about the interest rate Vanquis Bank Limited has charged her. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons: 
Miss Ns credit card was opened in 2005 and the original loan agreement along with 
a call recording of her application are no longer available. But businesses arent 
required to keep information indefinitely and Vanquis has sent in systems information 
to show the interest rate hasnt changed since 2009.
Vanquis terms and conditions allow it to change the interest rate by giving advance 
warning. Im satisfied the statements Vanquis sent Miss N clearly explained that the 
interest rates would increase from July 2009.
Vanquis accepts that it incorrectly told Miss N that the interest rate for her credit card 
had never increased when it first responded to her complaint. When Vanquis issued 
a new final response to Miss N on 25 January 2019 it apologised for giving her the 
wrong information and sent a cheque for £200. Im satisfied that £200 fairly reflects 
the impact of the incorrect information Vanquis gave Miss N when it first responded 
to her complaint.
I havent seen anything to show Vanquis has overcharged Miss N or that the interest 
rate it has used was wrong. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
 
 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss N to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 May 2020.Marco Manente
