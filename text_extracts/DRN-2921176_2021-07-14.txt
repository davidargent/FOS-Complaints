The complaint
Mr R is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA ended its business relationship with
him and with how it dealt with the balance of his account.
What happened
Mr R had an account with PayPal. In September 2020 PayPal placed a limitation on the
account. Mr R was then asked to provide information. PayPal reviewed the information Mr R
provided and realised that the account was opened prior to Mr R being 18 (although Mr R
says he is now 22). PayPal determined the account represented a risk. As a result, it ended
its business relationship with him on 17 September 2020.
Mr R says when his account was closed in September 2020, there was an account balance
of £254 and he asked for this to be returned to him. PayPal eventually allowed Mr R access
to the funds, which were withdrawn. But there was a refund to an electronic marketplace
provider, which left a debit balance which Mr R says he was pursued for by a collection
agency.
Mr R feels that as he is old enough for the account now, he should have been allowed to
keep the account. He also feels he received poor service on two occasions. He says on one
occasion an advisor laughed at him on the telephone and the other the adviser refused to
transfer him through to a manager.
The investigator recommended the complaint be upheld in part. He felt PayPal was entitled
to end their business relationship with Mr R and to limit his access to his money. He noted
that Mr R had said that his debt had been sold on to a collection agency. He also noted that
PayPal had told him that as it identified that Mr R was under the age of eighteen when the
account was created, he will not be liable for the amount owed. Therefore, the investigator
did not comment on this element further, as PayPal was not pursuing Mr R for the debt.
The investigator asked PayPal to provide call recordings three times. It didnt do so although
it said it would. The investigator therefore gave his view based on the evidence he had and
concluded that Mr R was provided with poor service in the way Mr R had described  that is
being laughed at and refusing to allow him to speak to a manager. The investigator thought
that PayPal should compensate Mr R £100 for the trouble and upset caused.
PayPal has asked for an ombudsmans decision as it disagrees with the investigators view.
It hasnt explained why it disagrees.
Provisional decision
I didnt agree with the investigators view and so I issued a provisional decision. I said I 
thought PayPals terms and conditions allowed it to place limitations on Mr Rs account and 
to decide to close it. So, I didnt think it did anything wrong when it did so.
Mr Rs account has a debit balance and Mr R has told this service the debt has been sold. 
The investigator didnt make any recommendation about this because PayPal had told him 
that it wouldnt be pursuing Mr R for this debt. But I said if it had sold the debt then this may 
not be within PayPals control. I hadnt seen anything to suggest PayPal was wrong to sell 
on the debt if it did. I said it was therefore for Mr R to deal with the owner of the debt.
I said I was disappointed that PayPal hadnt provided the calls as requested. I could see why 
the investigator had reached the view he did. But having read some of Mr Rs messages to 
PayPal I was not persuaded that either PayPal did provide him with poor service or if it did
that Mr R should be compensated. Some of his messages from Mr R contain language I 
couldnt repeat and are offensive. In this context I thought it wouldnt be the right outcome for 
Mr R to be compensated for being offended when he had written some offensive things to 
PayPal. I also thought that he was likely to have adopted a similar tone in the relevant calls 
and that the advisers may have responded to that tone.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal didnt respond.
Mr R did. He said:
PayPal wont allow him to open any more accounts because hes raised issues with 
it.
After he brought this compliant to this service PayPal passed the debt to a third-party 
company and he doesnt think this should be allowed. It has caused him stress and 
affected his credit file.
He was angry and rude in calls to PayPal because he was getting laughed at and no 
help was given as a result of PayPals mistake. He thinks PayPal is refusing to give 
the call because it knows he is right, and it is wrong. He thinks I am looking at 
PayPals side only.
He thinks PayPal should clear any debt caused by it and resolve any action caused 
to his credit score because it shouldnt have been passed to a third party during this 
situation.
Regarding Mr Rs first point  that PayPal wont let him open any more accounts - the 
investigator correctly explained to Mr R that this is a new complaint and so he needs to 
complain to PayPal first before we could look at this. 
Setting aside PayPals handling of calls with Mr R, I am satisfied it has done nothing wrong 
here. PayPals terms and conditions allow it to place limitations on Mr Rs account and to 
decide to close it. PayPal is also entitled to sell on any debts it has.Regarding the calls, I would prefer to be able to listen to the calls, but I havent been given 
them, so I need to look at the evidence I have. From that evidence I can see Mr R has said 
he was angry and rude in his call to PayPal but as a reaction to PayPals handling of the call. 
Mr R thinks that PayPal is refusing to give the calls because it knows he is right, and it is 
wrong. I dont think that is likely to be the reason. As I have already explained, I dont think 
PayPal was wrong to place limitations on his account or to decide to close it. 
From what Mr R has said  that he was angry and rude as a reaction to PayPal  we know 
he didnt handle them as well as he could have done. We also know he says PayPal 
provided poor service. Overall, I think if I listened to the calls, I would conclude that both 
parties didnt handle the calls as well as they could have done. And in these circumstances, I 
think it would be wrong to award compensation to Mr R for PayPals handling of the calls.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2021.
