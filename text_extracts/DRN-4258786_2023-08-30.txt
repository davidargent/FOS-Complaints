The complaint
Miss H complains that NewDay Ltd misinformed her that her credit card was interest free 
when it was not. 
What happened
Miss H opened a credit card account with NewDay in May 2022. She said she called 
NewDay to confirm it was interest free as thats what shed seen advertised. She said two 
employees confirmed that her card was interest free. But in October 2022 she found out 
shed been charged interest. She spoke to NewDay in October and November 2022 and was 
told how the interest was calculated on her account. Miss H wasnt happy so she 
complained.
NewDay said the adviser Miss H had spoken to in October 2022 had said shed been 
charged interest because shed made a late payment. But this was incorrect as shed been 
charged interest because shed not paid the complete balance on her statement. It 
apologised for this misinformation and paid Miss H £80 for the trouble and upset it had 
caused. It also noted that it had already refunded about £90 in interest payments, fees, and 
given Miss H a goodwill credit of £5 in November and December 2022. Miss H didnt think 
this resolved her complaint so approached this service.
Our investigator didnt think NewDay needed to do anything more. She noted that the terms 
and conditions of Miss Hs account and the account statements she received said that 
interest was chargeable but would only be applied if the balance wasnt paid in full. Miss H 
was adamant shed been told the account was interest free but our investigator said NewDay 
didnt have any records of any calls being made by Miss H before October 2022. 
Miss H didnt agree with our investigators view, so her complaint has been referred to me for 
a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss H says she was told by two members of NewDays staff that her credit card account 
was interest free. NewDay says it has no record of any calls from Miss H before 
October 2022 and its provided evidence to show the searches its done to verify that. Miss H 
provided some screenshots of messages she had with her partner and NewDay which show 
that she contacted NewDay. But those screenshots all refer to contact she had with NewDay 
after October 2022 and dont provide any evidence that she was told her card was interest 
free. So, while I recognise Miss Hs strength of feeling on this issue, without any evidence to 
support what shes said, I dont think it would be fair to say NewDay misinformed her. 
Im also mindful that the terms and conditions of Miss Hs agreement with NewDay sets out 
the interest rates it charges and explains how it works out the interest thats payable. The 
statements NewDay sent to Miss H also included information about the interest rates it was 
charging. I dont think that information is contradictory or misleading and as an account 
holder, I think its fair for NewDay to expect Miss H to read and understand the terms of the 
agreement she had with it. 
NewDay has accepted it made a mistake when Miss H called in October 2022. The NewDay 
adviser said shed been charged interest because shed made a late payment. But this was 
wrong as shed been charged interest because she hadnt paid her balance in full. NewDay 
has apologised for that mistake and paid Miss H £80 in compensation for the impact that had 
on her. It also refunded a total of about £90 in interest payments and fees and given her a 
goodwill credit of £5. Taken together, I think thats a fair and reasonable way for NewDay to 
put things right after giving her the wrong information in October 2022. 
In summary, while I recognise Miss H is adamant she was told by NewDay her credit card 
was interest free, I havent seen any evidence to support that. And I dont think it would be 
fair to say NewDay told her that based on the evidence I have seen. All the other information 
NewDay gave Miss H makes no mention of her account being interest free, and instead 
clearly sets out the interest it does charge. NewDay did make a mistake when Miss H called 
in October 2002 but Im satisfied its done enough to put that matter right. It follows that I 
dont think NewDay needs to do anything more.  
My final decision
NewDay has already paid Miss H £80 in compensation and refunded a total of about £90 in 
interest and fees, plus a goodwill credit of £5. I think that provides a reasonable outcome to 
Miss Hs complaint and so I dont think it needs to do anything more. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 September 2023.
