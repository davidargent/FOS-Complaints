K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that MYJAR  Limited  didnt  do enough checks before lending to him.
background
Mr S had ten loans  from MYJAR between Oct 2015 and February 2018 as follows:

* Maximum  monthly  scheduled repayment over the term of the loan
Mr S says MYJAR  did not verify  his outgoings and lent him large  amounts in comparison to 
his income. He says if MYJAR had done better  checks  it would have seen he had multiple 
short-term loans and was dependent on this type of credit. Mr S adds that his pattern of 
borrowing should have  indicated to MYJAR that he was a poor candidate for further credit.
MYJAR says it asked Mr S about  his income  and expenditure and validated  the data using 
information from his credit file. It says it finds the checks  it carried  out were proportional and 
adequate and showed the loans to be affordable. However it offered to uphold loan 8 due to 
the number of new unsecured loans shown on Mr Ss credit  file at the time.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She found that Mr Ss 
pattern of borrowing suggested  he had become reliant on short-term loans by the time he 
applied for loan 6. So she recommended MYJAR  should refund interest and charges on 
loans 6 to 10 (plus 8% statutory interest) and remove  the loans from Mr Ss credit file.
MYJAR responded  to say, in summary,  that it had carried out increased  checks for Mr S and 
feels they were proportionate to the circumstances  of his loans.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN70496002But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint.
Loans 1 and 2
I consider MYJAR  did enough checks before approving these loans. I say that because the 
repayments were a small proportion of Mr Ss income and there was nothing  in the available  
information to indicate he was in financial difficulty.
Loans 3 to 5
Because the scheduled repayment on these  loans were higher, and Mr S had been 
borrowing for a longer  period of time,  I think, as a minimum, MYJAR should have found out 
whether Mr S had any other short-term loans  before  it approved these applications. I can 
see it asked Mr S about his income  and expenditure and he declared disposable income of 
between £1,450 and £1,700. But I cant see it checked whether he had any outstanding  
short-term loans.
Based on the available information though, there  is nothing to indicate Mr S wouldnt have 
been able to sustainably make the repayments  on these loans so I cant  conclude  MYJAR 
was wrong to approve them.
Ref: DRN70496003Loans 6 to 10
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MYJARs  lending history with Mr S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR  should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr S was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one. So MYJAR ought to have  realised it was more  likely than not Mr S was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances and that Mr Ss indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably;
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR. Lan 10 was 
taken out over two years  after Mr Ss first. And it was for a far larger  amount. Mr S 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to MYJAR over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr S lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ss 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 10 and MYJAR  should put things  right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. MYJAR  Limited should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr S paid on loans 6 to 10;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loan 10, apply  the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr S; 
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 10 should be removed from 
Mr Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one. If MYJAR 
intends to apply the refund to reduce  any outstanding  capital balance,  it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 August 2019.
