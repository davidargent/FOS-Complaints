The complaint
Ms W is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Marbles, provided her with a credit account
which she feels was unaffordable for her at that time.
Ms W is also unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Marbles, subsequently increased the
credit limit on her account, which again was unaffordable for her at that time.  
What happened
Ms W applied for a NewDay credit account in June 2015. Ms Ws application was approved,
and her credit account was opened with an initial credit limit of £300.
In September 2015, the credit limit on Mr Ws account was increased to £950. A further
credit limit increase, from £950 to £1,200, was proposed by NewDay in February 2016, but
this credit limit increase subsequently didnt take place.
Ms W encountered difficulties maintaining her credit account and the account fell into
arrears. This resulted in Ms Ws account being defaulted for non-payment of outstanding
arrears in December 2016, and the account was subsequently sold by NewDay to a debt
purchasing company, with whom the account currently resides.
In November 2019, Ms W raised a complaint on the basis that she felt that she shouldnt
have been approved for the credit account, or the later credit limit increase, because of her
personal and financial circumstances at those times.
NewDay looked at Ms Ws complaint, but they explained that they had undertaken checks
into Mr Ws financial position, both at the time of the initial account application and the
subsequent credit limit increase, and that there was nothing within those checks that gave
them cause to consider that the credit being offered was unaffordable for Ms W at those
times. So, they didnt uphold Ms Ws complaint.
Ms W wasnt satisfied with NewDay response, so she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They also felt that the checks that NewDay
had undertaken into Ms Ws financial situation at the time of the initial account application
hadnt highlighted anything that should have given NewDay reason to suspect that the credit
account with the initial credit limit of £300 should have been unaffordable for Ms W. So, they
didnt recommend that this aspect of Ms Ws complaint be upheld.
However, our investigator did feel that the information that was available to NewDay at the
time of the credit limit increase to £950 in September 2015 should have given NewDay
cause to consider that the credit limit increase might not be affordable for Ms W at that time,
such that it shouldnt have been offered. So, our investigator recommended that this
complaint be upheld in Ms Ws favour on that basis, and they recommended that NewDay
undertake corrective action accordingly.
NewDay accepted the spirit of our investigators decision, but they noted that there had been
some confusion surrounding a linked complaint Ms W had raised, whereby NewDay had
worked on the basis that Ms Ws complaint here  against NewDay Ltd, trading as Marbles 
was included in that linked case and had taken corrective action on that case accordingly.
As such, NewDay felt that they were being asked in this instance to duplicate corrective
action already undertaken by them in relation to Ms Ws Marbles account.
Our investigator noted the confusion and amended their recommendation to take account of
this. Ms W wasnt satisfied with the final recommendation made by our investigator, so the
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 28 May 2021 as follows:
Given the confusion surrounding this complaint, I feel its important to structure this
provisional decision letter to clarify all aspects of this complaint under consideration. 
As such, Ill deal first with the complaint, and then with what I feel NewDay need to 
do resulting from the complaint.
The complaint
Its for a business to decide whether they will offer credit to a customer, and if so, 
how much and on what terms. What this service would expect would be that the 
business would conduct reasonable and proportionate checks to ensure that any 
credit being offered to a customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
With regard Ms Ws initial account application, NewDay say that they did that there. 
They took details of Ms Ws income and expenditure to ensure that she had sufficient 
disposable monthly income to be able to afford the potential repayments, and they 
checked Ms Ws credit file to get a wider understanding of her financial position at 
that time. And NewDay contend that there was nothing resulting from these checks 
that gave them cause to suspect that the credit being offered to Ms W was 
unaffordable for her at that time.
Ive reviewed the information that NewDay took into account when considering Ms 
Ws account application and having done so Im satisfied that it was reasonable for 
NewDay to conclude that the credit account with the initial credit limit of £300 would 
be affordable for Ms W at that time. Ms Ws annual income was recorded as being in 
excess of £26,000, and while there were historical defaults present on Ms Ws credit 
file, these were all older than three years at the time of the account application, and I 
feel that it was reasonable for NewDay to conclude from Ms Ws credit file at that 
time that Ms W had been managing her existing credit responsibly and without 
significant incident in the more recent past.
It follows that Im satisfied that it wasnt unfair or unreasonable for NewDay to 
conclude that a credit account with a credit limit of £300 would be affordable for Ms 
W at the time of the application, and I cant therefore conclude that NewDay shouldnt 
have offered this credit account to Ms W following her applying for the account in 
June 2015.
However, Im not convinced that it was fair or reasonable for NewDay to draw the 
same conclusions with regard the later credit limit increase, from £300 to £950, in 
September 2015. And I say this because Ms Ws credit file at that time demonstrated a deterioration in her financial position including that she was in arrears with another 
credit provider at that time. And I note that NewDay, in their correspondence with this 
service, have accepted that this credit limit increase shouldnt have been offered to 
Ms W for this reason.
It follows from this that Ill be provisionally upholding this account in Ms Ws favour, 
on the basis of the credit limit increase from £300 to £950 in September 2015 only.
Putting things right
Id like to clarify the action that NewDay must undertake as follows:
1. NewDay must reimburse all interest incurred on Ms Ws account for the balance 
over £300 from 16 September 2015 onwards.
2. NewDay must also reimburse all fees and charges incurred on Ms Ws account 
after that same date.
3. If these reimbursements result in a credit balance on the account in Ms Ws favour,
NewDay must pay this balance to Ms W along with 8% simple interest, calculated
from the date of the interest, fee, or charge being reimbursed to the date of payment
to Ms W.
4. Finally, NewDay must remove all adverse reporting from Ms Ws credit file from
September 2015 onwards.
With regard point three above: In their initial view of this complaint, our investigator
recommended that NewDay should reimburse all interest, charges and fees (points 
one and two above) along with 8% simple interest. NewDay correctly pointed out that 
an award of 8% interest is usually only made when a customer is deemed out of 
pocket or to have incurred a financial loss, and so our investigator removed the 
requirement to include 8% interest from their amended view.
However, if its the case that the reimbursements made to Ms Ws account as a result 
of points one and two above leave Ms Ws account with a credit balance in her 
favour, then I consider that she can be considered as being out of pocket for that 
credit amount, and so I have included point three so as to instruct NewDay to pay 8% 
simple interest on that credit balance  if such a credit balance comes to exist.
Finally, in their initial view of this complaint, our investigator also recommended that 
NewDay should make a payment of £200 to Ms W to compensate her for the trouble 
and upset that she had incurred as a result of her account being sold to a debt 
purchasing company, which, given that NewDay were aware of Ms Ws health 
problems at that time, it was felt shouldnt have taken place.
NewDay accepted the spirit of our investigators decision here, but they explained 
that there had been some confusion with regard a linked complaint for another 
NewDay account that Ms W had raised. Essentially, NewDay explained that they 
hadnt correctly registered that the complaint had been split such that each NewDay 
account was being treated separately and had believed that there was only one 
complaint incorporating both NewDay accounts.
And its notable that NewDays submissions to this service appear to corroborate that 
there was a misunderstanding at NewDay with regard how the complaints had been 
structured by this service.NewDay then explained that they had already made a payment to Ms W of £300 in 
relation to the linked complaint on the basis of their selling Ms Ws accounts to the 
debt purchasing company, and that NewDay felt that this amount was fair and 
reasonable compensation for both accounts being transferred, and had been agreed 
by them as such on that understanding.
This seems reasonable to me, and I can confirm that considering the £300 payment 
made to Ms W as being £150 per account is commensurate with what this service 
would expect, given the circumstances here. And I dont feel that it would be 
reasonable or proportionate to instruct NewDay to make further payment regarding 
this point. I can appreciate from Ms Ws correspondence that Ms W doesnt share my 
opinion on this matter, but my provisional decision here wont include any 
requirement for NewDay to make any further payment in this regard.
I hope that this provisional decision provides a clear explanation of my current 
position on this matter, and I welcome any comments of further information either 
party might wish to provide.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Ms W and NewDay the opportunity to provide 
any comments or additional information they wished me to consider before I moved to a final 
decision.
NewDay confirmed that they had nothing further to add and that they accepted the 
provisional decision. Whereas Ms W asked me to reconsider my not instructing NewDay to 
pay compensation for distress and inconvenience in this instance on the basis that there had 
been some confusion regarding the separating of this complaint from a related complaint 
and the payment of compensation that has already taken place on that related complaint - as 
described above.
Ms W feels that compensation should be warranted on both complaints, given that they are 
being considered separately, and that therefore the £200 compensation amount initially 
recommended by our investigator should be reinstated here.
I can appreciate Ms Ws point here  to a degree. But given that there has been some 
confusion over the separation of this complaint from the related complaint. And, given that a 
payment of £300 compensation has already been paid on that related complaint, I dont feel 
that a further payment of compensation is warranted on this complaint in this instance. 
The reason I say this is that I dont feel that a total compensation amount of £500 across 
both complaints is reasonable and proportionate in this instance, and I note that it goes 
beyond what this service would consider as commensurate, given the circumstances here. 
Instead, I feel that the £300 already paid by NewDay, who at the time were under the 
incorrect impression that the payment related to both complaints and so didnt challenge the 
amount, does represent a fair and reasonable compensation amount across both 
complaints, and I note that considering that payment as £150 per complaint is 
commensurate with what this service would expect here.
As such, while I understand that Ms W may not agree with my position here, and while I 
apologise for any confusion that this matter may have cause, I see no reason not to uphold 
this complaint on the basis outlined in my provisional decision, and my final decision will 
therefore be a confirmation of the provisional decision previously issued.
Putting things rightNewDay must reimburse all interest incurred on Ms Ws account for the balance over
£300 from 16 September 2015 onwards.
NewDay must also reimburse all fees and charges incurred on Ms Ws account after
that same date.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance on the account in Ms Ws favour,
NewDay must pay this balance to Ms W along with 8% simple interest, calculated
from the date of the interest, fee, or charge being reimbursed to the date of payment
to Ms W.
Finally, NewDay must remove all adverse reporting from Ms Ws credit file from
September 2015 onwards.
  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd, trading as Marbles, on 
the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2021.
