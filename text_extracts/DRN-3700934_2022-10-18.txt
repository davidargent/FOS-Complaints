The complaint
Mr W has complained that Halifax rejected his claim against it under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the Act) in relation to his purchase of some solar panels.
Background
Mr W bought solar panels for his home in 2013. He paid with cheques drawn on his account 
with Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax. In 2022, after deciding that the panels had been 
mis-sold, he asked Halifax for a refund under the Act (as the supplier of the panels was no 
longer trading).
One of our adjudicators looked into what had happened. Having considered all the 
information and evidence provided, our adjudicator didnt think that section 75 of the Act 
applied to Mr Ws purchase, and so Halifax was not liable for any mis-sale by the supplier. 
Mr W asked for an ombudsmans decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered everything provided, I do not uphold this complaint. That is 
because section 75 of the Act does not apply to payments made by cheque.
Where goods or services are purchased on credit, section 75 can make the provider of credit 
jointly and equally liable with the supplier of the goods or services for a misrepresentation or 
breach of contract by the supplier. But Mr W has confirmed that he did not buy the panels on 
credit.
It follows that section 75 does not make Halifax liable for anything the supplier did. Nor does 
any other provision of the Act. I dont think it would be fair and reasonable of me to still hold 
Halifax responsible for any mis-sale by the supplier in circumstances where the Act does not 
make it liable  even though the supplier is no longer trading.
My final decision
So my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2022.
