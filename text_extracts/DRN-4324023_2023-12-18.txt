The complaint
Mr T complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his credit card. 
What happened
Mr T had a credit card with NatWest for a number of years. Previously, when Mr Ts credit 
card expired NatWest would issue a replacement automatically. Mr T last used his NatWest 
credit card in August 2021 and cleared the outstanding balance. 
In July 2022 NatWest wrote to Mr T to advise that his credit card was due to expire. 
NatWests letter asked Mr T to make contact within three months if he wanted to retain the 
credit card, otherwise it would be closed. But Mr Ts explained he was out of the country at 
the time and didnt read NatWests until his return to the UK. By that time, the credit card had 
closed. 
Mr T went on to contact NatWest and asked it to reactivate his credit card. Mr T complained 
and NatWest issued a final response on 14 January 2023. NatWest said it had given Mr T 
three months to confirm whether he wanted to retain the credit card before closing it and 
didnt uphold his complaint. 
An investigator at this service looked at Mr Ts complaint. The investigator thought NatWest 
had provided reasonable notice of its intention to close Mr Ts credit card and didnt ask it to 
do anything else. Mr T asked to appeal so his complaint has been passed to me to make a 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware Ive summarised the events surrounding this complaint in less detail than the 
parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by my approach which reflects the informal 
nature of this service. I want to assure all parties Ive read and considered everything on file. 
Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every point raised to fairly reach my decision. And if 
I dont comment on something, its not because I havent considered it. Its because Ive 
focused on what I think are the key issues. My approach is in line with the rules we operate 
under.
I understand Mr T wanted to retain his credit card and was abroad when NatWest sent its 
letter in July 2022. But I have to be fair to both parties and NatWest has pointed out that Mr 
T hadnt used his credit card for around year before it reviewed his account and took the 
decision not to renew it. NatWest has explained its not under an obligation to renew credit 
cards and that it can review and account and take the decision to close it, in line with the 
terms and conditions. 
Ive reviewed NatWests credit card terms and conditions. They say NatWest can take the 
decision to close a credit card by giving advance notice to the card holder. Here, NatWest 
wrote to Mr T in July 2022 and said it would close his credit card in three months if no 
contact was received. As no contact from Mr T was received, Im satisfied NatWest acted in 
line with its terms and conditions when it closed his credit card. 
I also think its fair to say NatWest wasnt aware Mr T was abroad for an extended period. So 
whilst I understand why Mr T didnt receive NatWests letter until after the account was 
closed, I havent seen anything that shows it acted unfairly. 
In response to the investigator, Mr T advised that NatWest had replaced two existing credit 
cards with a singled one. Whilst I can see there were previously Visa and Mastercard credit 
cards attached to the account, they were replaced by a single credit card by NatWest. And 
NatWests letter in July 2022 related to the overall account when it advised no new credit 
card would be issued if Mr T didnt get in touch. I havent seen any evidence that shows 
NatWest made a mistake. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr T but as Im satisfied NatWest acted in line with the account 
terms and conditions and havent found evidence to show its decision to close his credit card 
was unfair Im not telling it to do anything else.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 January 2024.
