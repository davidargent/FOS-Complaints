The complaint
Mr W complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt remove his brother 
(whom Ill call B) from their partnership account when B was made bankrupt in 2010. 
Mr W says this has formed part of a substantial dispute between him and B.
Mr W is represented, but for ease of reading I will refer to their actions collectively as Mr Ws.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known by both parties, so I wont repeat them here. 
Instead, I will focus on the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has said given the time that has passed it has no record of being notified of Bs 
bankruptcy in 2010. I dont find this unusual, or unreasonable, given banks dont need to 
keep records indefinitely.
Mr W says NatWest would most likely have been contacted by the Official Receiver. There 
is, however, no evidence to show NatWest was contacted by the Official Receiver. And if 
NatWest had been contacted, given the formal nature of such correspondence, I find it most 
likely NatWest would have acted upon it. It didnt. It follows Im not persuaded NatWest was 
contacted by the Official Receiver.
Mr W says Bs bankruptcy would have been published in the London Gazette, which 
NatWest should have acted upon. Mr W hasnt shown B was made bankrupt in 2010, or that 
said bankruptcy was published in the London Gazette. But in any case, Im not aware of any 
requirements in 2010 which would mean NatWest needed to actively cross reference the 
London Gazette with its customers.  
Mr W says NatWest removed B from the account sometime between 2007 and 2017. Its 
provided some correspondence which it says supports this. Leaving aside the somewhat 
contradictory nature of this point, NatWests records show the account remained a 
partnership account. And it has shown Mr W was the lead correspondent. So while I accept 
the name(s) across documents appears to show a change, Im not persuaded this reflects a 
change in the account type (or who was named on the account).
There is no evidence, prior to late 2021, of Mr W (or B) asking NatWest to remove B from 
the account. Or convert the account into a sole trader account. Indeed, a mandate 
completed by Mr W in early 2021 (so 11 years after Bs alleged bankruptcy) shows he said it 
was a partnership account, that he was a partner, and that B was a partner. 
In late 2021 Mr W completed another mandate saying it was a sole trader account and he 
was a proprietor. In response to this mandate NatWest wrote to Mr W to say it couldnt 
process his request because it was a partnership account and hed selected it was a sole 
trader account, so he needed to act to covert the account status. This further supports that 
the account was, and always had been, a partnership account.
Overall, I find NatWest didnt remove B from the account because it wasnt aware there was 
a need to, and it wasnt asked to. It follows I dont uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 April 2023.
