DRN-1555903
The complaint
Mr D complains about the contribution that he was required to make for a car that was 
supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with FCE Bank plc, trading as Ford Credit.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
the hire purchase agreement - which Mr D signed electronically - set out the terms on 
which the car was being supplied to him and showed that the amount of credit being 
provided to him was £21,031.90;
the invoice shows that the basic price of the car was £25,146.90 but, after 
adjustments, the price was reduced to £21,031.90 - the same as the amount of credit 
that was being provided to him;
Mr D had made an application for a higher amount of credit - which had been 
rejected because Ford Credit says that it didn't meet its underwriting criteria;
Ford Credit says that the dealer then restructured the deal for the car which was 
agreed with Mr D and a revised application was made - which it approved;
Mr D says that it was Ford Credit that said that he had to contribute an additional 
£5,000;
it's a commercial decision for a lender to decide whether or not it wants to lend to a 
customer - there's no requirement for it to do so and this service wouldn't normally 
interfere with a business' commercial decisions (and I see no reason to interfere with 
Ford Credit's commercial decision in these circumstances);
I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that Ford Credit acted 
incorrectly when it declined Mr D's initial application - or that it acted unfairly or 
unreasonably in connection with the amount of credit that it provided to him;
Mr D agreed to the terms set out in the hire purchase agreement and the car was 
supplied to him on those terms;
if he didn't want to accept the credit on the terms set out in the agreement he 
shouldn't have signed the agreement - and he would then have had the option to 
chose a different car (or not to replace his car), to negotiate a different deal for this 
car or to obtain credit from another provider; and
I don't consider that there's enough evidence to show that Ford Credit has treated Mr 
D unfairly in these circumstances - so I find that it wouldn't be fair or reasonable for 
me to require it to change the terms of the agreement, to pay any compensation to 
Mr D or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
 My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I don't uphold Mr D's complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2020.
