Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ns complaint and thought the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because it looked like he wasnt managing his money and his 
borrowing pattern indicated he was reliant on this type of loan. Nova disagreed. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Nova needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr N could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Nova should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).

20 15/11/2018 27/11/2018 6 £600.00
21 09/01/2019 25/01/2019 6 £350.00
22 31/01/2019 15/10/2019 6 £630.00There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Nova was required to establish 
whether Mr N could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ns complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Nova needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 4. Mr N 
didnt respond to the view. As there is no dispute about these loans, I wont be making any 
findings on them.
I think when Mr N applied for loan 5 there was enough of a suggestion from his borrowing 
behaviour that he was having problems managing his money. This was the fourth time Mr N 
had returned shortly after repaying a loan and asked for further borrowing. Given the nature 
of these types of loan, I would question why someone would repay one loan only to quickly 
come back and borrow more. 
In addition, I think the fact Mr N repaid his loans much earlier than planned should have 
caused some concern to Nova. As that might be the sort of behaviour that would indicate 
someone was facing problems managing their money and needing to refinance loans on a 
regular basis.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Novas lending history with Mr N, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Nova should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Nova should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Ns case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because: 
at this point Nova ought to have realised Mr N was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr N had taken out six loans in seven months. So, Nova ought to have 
realised it was more likely that Mr Ns indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
Mr Ns first loan was for £500 and loan 6 was for £700. By now, Nova ought to have 
known that it was unlikely Mr N was borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
He also wasnt really making any inroads to the amount he owed Nova. Loan 22 was 
taken out two and a half years after Mr Ns first. Mr N had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Nova over an extended period.
 I think that Mr N lost out because Nova provided borrowing for loan 6 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ns indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr N borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ns ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding Mr Ns complaint about loans 5 to 22. 
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr N paid on loans 5 to 22;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loan 5 from Mr Ns credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 6 to 22 should be removed from  
Mr Ns credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Nova to take off tax from this interest. Nova must give 
Mr N a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
Im partially upholding Mr Ns complaint. Novaloans Ltd should put things right as set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 August 2020.
