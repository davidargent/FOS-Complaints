The complaint
Mr L complains that MPA Financial Management Limited (MPA) failed to follow his signed 
investment instructions. He says this has led to a large financial loss. Mr L also complains 
that hes not had any contact with MPA since June 2020. So hed like his ongoing advice 
fees refunded.
  
What happened
Mr L had a review with his Independent Financial Adviser (IFA) on 23 January 2020. He was 
unhappy with his current investments. It was agreed to invest in the two different 
investments - which I will call A investment and B investment in this decision - that matched 
his risk profile. Mr L signed the suitability report, dated 30 January 2020, produced after that 
meeting. This authorised the fund switch.
The A investment portfolio was set up with £260,000 invested. But only £50,000 of the B 
investment was made.  Mr L complained that MPA had gone against the signed agreed 
mandate and had made unauthorised decisions. He said thatd resulted in him suffering a 
large financial loss. 
Mr L also said this wasnt the first time MPA had gone against agreed authorised investment 
decisions. He said that when hed transferred some money in from other pension in 2018 his 
transfer money was held in cash for 6 months. 
MPA said that Mr L signed the client agreement and the Attitude to Risk questionnaire on 11 
February 2020. And returned them on 17 February 2020. They said that Mr L agreed to 
suspend selling his original investments until that provider had announced their quarterly 
review on 25 February 2020. They noted that the unit price increased by 0.99% on 25 
February 2020 at which point they switched the investment out. At that stage it was agreed 
that the right strategy would be 50% A investment and 50% B investment. The original 
investments were disinvested on the 13 March 2020.
MPA said that between 25 February 2020 and 13 March 2020 when the original investment 
provider had paid out, the FTSE 100 had fallen by -23%. They said that Mr L had a phone 
conversation with his IFA and agreed to hold on to the cash to see how far the markets 
would fall. They said that Mr L agreed at that time that he would only invest £50,000 in B 
investment and see how the markets would react. They said it was agreed to send the whole 
amount to A investment, because they were discretionary managers. Therefore they could 
drip feed the money into the markets as and when they saw fit. A investment provider 
received £260,000 on the 10 March 2020. £50,000 of B investment was purchased on 18 
March 2020.
Mr L asked to buy £30,000 in another investment. His IFA agreed. But forgot to process the 
order. This came to light when Mr L asked for an update on 17 March 2020. The £30,000 
was purchased on 20 April 2020 and MPA agreed to reimburse Mr L for any loss.
MPA wrote to Mr L on 28 May 2020 to make a formal offer of compensation for the delayed 
£30,000 investment. Mr L accepted this offer in September 2020.
Ill include relevant e-mails/texts between Mr L and his IFA here. These will be referenced in 
my decision later on. 
19 February 2020  Mr L emailed his IFA about selling his original investment: Further to 
conversation yesterday can you forward me the [A investment document] regarding the 
investment forecast for this year, furthermore I would welcome the opportunity for a face to 
face meeting with my fund manager to understand investment strategy.
Let me know what your [original investment man] is predicting in terms of growth fund rate 
changes, to enable me to commit to the pension switch.
There was a possibility of an extra bonus on the original investment on 28 February 2020. 
So it was agreed to wait to see what that amounted to. Mr L emailed his IFA the following: 
Thanks for the update from the {original investment provider], I agree lets wait until 28th to 
see what the bonus is before we make a final decision to switch.
28 February 2020  Mr L emailed his IFA for an update about the potential bonus. He replied 
as follows: They have kept growth rates as they are and they have not increased the share 
price. Think we should sell the [original investment] now and try to get in with [A investment] 
at these low prices.
2 March 2020  Mr L emailed his IFA as follows: Thanks for confirming this lets do as you 
say sell [original investment] and buy [A investment] at the low price. Are we still going to 
buy 50/50 [B investment] and [A investment]? The [B investment] is an index fund which 
tracks the equity markets if I am correct, if so is the current volatility good or bad for the [B 
investment] fund?
His IFA replied as follows: The [B investment] fund is a balanced portfolio that uses trackers 
to track various indices. So, the volatility in equity markets will affect it but there are other 
indices such as bonds and gilts that will not be affected by the volatility in equity markets.
Mr L replied: Ok so we are going for 50/50 [B investment] and [A investment]? Is that Your 
recommendation?
His IFA replied: Yes it is
Mr L then emailed: Ok lets do it whilst its cheap to buy.
3 March 2020  investment instruction to invest in A investment signed by Mr Ls IFA.
3 and 4 March 2020 (approx.)  Original investment plans disinvested totalling £528,629.86.
6 March 2020  Mr L emailed his IFA for an update: Can you please update me as how my 
pension switch is progressing?
His IFA replied: Still waiting for the money to come out of the [original investment provider].
12 March 2020  Mr L obtained the final value of the original investment funds. He emailed 
his IFA about the performance of the A investment and B investment funds: Can you please 
advise on the [B investment] and [A investment] fund performance year to date with current 
economic downturn?
17 March 2020  Mr L asked to arrange a call with his IFA. A subsequent phone 
conversation was held. The call note from Mr Ls IFA said: Discussed buying some [B 
investment] now. Recommended £50,000. He wanted £100,000 initially but discussed and agreed £50,000.
Following this, Mr Ls IFA messaged him: Bought £50k [B investment] this morning just 
heard from [original investment provider] and they have reduced unit price by 12%. That was 
close.
18 March 2020  Contract note issued confirming the purchase of [B investment] for 
£50,000.
27 March 2020  The following email exchange took place:
Mr L to his IFA: .What are your thoughts regarding investment strategy?
IFA to Mr L:   My opinion is this may have further to fall as death rates keep rising.
Mr L to his IFA: Let me know what you decide I think we should have bought more of [B 
investment] at least £100,000? It has already gone up 9%.
IFA to Mr L: FTSE 100 down -6% today.
14 April 2020  Mr L sent the following email to his IFA: Can you please update me on your 
investment strategy? [B investment] is up 10% yet we only bought £50k we still have 
£216,000 in cash. I know last time we spoke you said markets were still down. Let me know 
your thoughts.
His IFA replied: My concerns have been around the economic fallout from the virus and that 
the markets could easily slip back to 5000 on the FTSE 100. I wish we had bought more at 
5000. At the moment and last week, the markets were fairly stable but have crept up. If it 
falls back to 5500 we should buy more. At the moment its 5800. If you want me to buy more 
at current prices I will do.
He then replied: I did raise concerns that we did not buy enough and mentioned at the time 
we should have bought at least £100,000. However, you advised against buying more? Lets 
monitor the situation as I do not want to buy more at current prices.
And his IFA agreed with this approach. 
17 April 2020  Mr L sent the following email to his IFA:
Further to our recent communication when I instructed you to purchase additional £30k 
[investment] at the agreed price. I now note there are no new active orders listed on my 
online account therefore you have failed to carry out the agreed instruction and the share 
price is a has now gone up. Please advise why you have not acted on an agreed instruction 
when you are fully aware of price fluctuations?.
His IFA replied the same day: We did agree the purchase last Thursday and I am really 
sorry, but I thought I had instructed [name] to buy but I didn't. I put the purchase through and 
when we know the price we buy at we will pay you the difference if there is a loss on the 
purchase. The trade should go through on Monday. 
28 April 2020 - Mr L emailed his IFA the following: Any thoughts on how and when we 
should be investing the rest £186,000 cash?.
7 May 2020  Mr Ls IFA emailed him the following: The £30,000 investment issue stills 
remains unresolved as well as strategy for the £186,000 cash.And: I still think strategy should be 5500 is a good price and I am not convinced that the 
markets will not crash yet when the economic fallout of this kicks in and when furlough 
comes to an end. The markets have not moved really in two weeks and we are back at 
5800.
28 May 2020  Mr L emailed his IFA reiterating his concerns of the decision not to invest his 
cash. He said the following: Furthermore again I find myself sitting on cash with no real 
strategy for investing apart from invest when FTSE 100 is at 5500 this seems strange as you 
failed to invest when I urged you to invest more when FTSE was at 5000 also what happens 
if the FTSE 100 does not fall to 5500. Yet again I find myself sitting on cash when fund 
markets are rising and it is now the second time I have lost substantial amounts of money 
due not been invested.
His IFA replied as follows: Regarding the cash you hold, the markers still keep rising and 
my advice was and still is I think it will fall, but as Ive said all along if you want to invest more 
at certain points I will take instruction. You rejected that idea when the markets were at 5800 
as you said it was too high. Its now 6200. Question is do we wait longer or invest some at 
this point. In hindsight I could have invested it all at the start, but you agreed with me not to 
at that point.
This was the last email exchange Ive seen before Mr L complained to MPA.
In their final response letter of 28 July 2020, MPA didnt uphold Mr Ls complaint. They said 
hed made statements which were incorrect. They noted that he was fully invested much 
sooner than hed suggested after his 2018 transfers. They said hed had meetings and 
discussions with his IFA at every stage of the process in terms of where the investments 
should be invested. And that hed agreed with his IFAs proposals. They said that theyd 
never invested Mr Ls money without his agreement. And felt that Mr L had only decided to 
disagree with the agreed strategy when the market had risen. They noted that Mr L could 
always disagree with his IFA. And that he couldve instructed him to buy whatever 
investment he wanted. They noted the error theyd paid compensation for was proof of this. 
But MPA offered to reimburse him for the advisory fees theyd received since his letter of 
complaint of 1 June 2020. This amounted to £544.98. As they noted that since that date hed 
had no communication from MPA while his complaint was being investigated.
Mr L accepted the compensation MPA had offered for delaying his £30,000 investment in 
September 2020. But he didnt agree that theyd invested in line with his instructions. He also 
said that no review meetings had taken place since the complaint was made. He didnt 
accept the compensation offered for the service hed received. So he brought his complaint 
to this service. 
Our investigator didnt think MPA had done anything wrong or acted without his prior 
knowledge. He noted that MPA had originally offered £544.98 as a refund of ongoing advice 
fees between 1 June 2020 and 28 July 2020. And that they had additionally offering a refund 
of 50% of Mr Ls ongoing advice fees between 28 July 2020 and 11 February 2021. This 
equated to £1,024.54. He felt that MPAs offer was fair and reasonable for missing out on 
ongoing advice and review meetings after Mr L had made a complaint. And that he should 
accept it.
Mr L didnt agree. He said no phone call between him and his IFA took place on 17 March 
2020 and asked this service to ask for phone records. He also said that he had no 
recollection giving his IFA the authority to invest only £50,000 of the £260,000. He also felt 
that his IFA had been in breach of his contract to manage his pension fund. And he didnt 
feel the compensation thatd been offered was fair. So our investigator asked MPA to provide call records. He told Mr L that MPA had provided 
these. And that they confirmed that Mr Ls IFA had made a call to him on his mobile on 17 
March 2020 at 9.03 am. He noted that the call had lasted for 14 minutes.
Our investigator agreed that there had been a lack of review meetings. But noted that MPA 
had offered to pay back some fees because of this. He didnt agree that the lack of review 
meetings had been a direct cause of any losses Mr L had suffered. And noted that before his 
complaint, thered been regular communication and discussions between Mr L and his IFA. 
As agreement couldnt be reached, this complaint has come to me for review.
I issued a provisional decision on 16 September 2021. It said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so, I intend to uphold it. Although Mr L may still be disappointed. I agree with 
our investigator that MPA didnt act without Mr Ls prior knowledge. But I dont agree that the 
settlement offer is fair and reasonable. Ill explain why.
Mr L complains about MPA not following his authorised investment instructions. And about 
the ongoing fees he was charged since June 2020. Ill consider the two parts of his 
complaint separately.
B investment
MPA and Mr L confirmed that hes an MPA Private client. This service included on-going 
access to his adviser by phone, text or email. It also included half yearly meetings and 
quarterly reviews of performance, charges and risk profile. I also note from the fund switch 
instruction form that the decision to switch funds couldve been made by meeting, email, 
phone or letter. So agreement to transact doesnt have to be made in writing.
Mr L says that he didnt agree to a different investment strategy after the initial 
recommendations had been made at the end of January 2020. But MPA say that he did 
agree to changes. So I need to decide whether or not Mr L agreed to a change to the 
investment strategy he detailed in 30 January 2020 suitability report.
Based on the evidence, Im satisfied that Mr L did agree to a different investment strategy. 
Ive reached my decision on the basis of the emails that Ive seen between Mr L and his IFA. 
Ill explain why, referencing the emails Ive included in the Background section above. 
Mr L said the following in two separate emails dated 19 February 2020 (my bold text): Let 
me know what your [original investment man] is predicting in terms of growth fund rate 
changes, to enable me to commit to the pension switch.
And: I agree lets wait until 28th to see what the bonus is before we make a final decision 
to switch.
These emails clearly show that at this point Mr L hadnt yet decided to follow the 
recommendation hed agreed to in the signed 30 January 2020 suitability report. 
On 2 March 2020, Mr L asked his IFA for further detail on the B investment proposed: The 
[B investment] is an index fund which tracks the equity markets if I am correct, if so is the 
current volatility good or bad for the [B investment] fund?So its clear that Mr L was still uncertain about the B investment as he was asking for further 
information about it. At this point in time, Mr L authorised the transfer from the original 
investment provider. Funds were disinvested in the next couple of days. But the money 
wasnt available for new investment until a few days after that.
On 12 March 2020, Mr L asked his IFA: Can you please advise on the [B investment] and [A 
investment] fund performance year to date with current economic downturn?
This suggests that Mr L had concerns about both the investments hed originally chosen. 
The UK was going through an economic downturn brought on by the pandemic. So 
investment conditions had changed since the original suitability report had been signed. 
On 17 March 2020, Mr L wanted to speak to his IFA about B investment. The call note MPA 
have shared with this service suggests that Mr L agreed to buy the recommended £50,000 
of that investment. The note also suggests that hed originally wanted to invest £100,000. 
But that hed agreed to invest £50,000. 
Mr Ls IFA sent an email on the same date which said: Bought £50k [B investment] this 
morning just heard from [original investment provider] and they have reduced unit price by 
12%. That was close.
Mr L didnt respond negatively to this email. I consider that if the incorrect amount had been 
invested, he wouldve quickly replied to that email to correct any error. Ive also seen the 
contract note for the £50,000 trade on 18 March 2020. Its correctly addressed to Mr Ls 
home address. So Im satisfied that he wouldve also received that confirmation of the trade 
thatd gone ahead. Hed quickly noticed a previous error when MPA hadnt followed his 
instructions to purchase £30,000 of a different investment in a timely manner. So Im 
satisfied that if thered been an error in the amount of B investment purchased at that time 
Mr L wouldve quickly told his adviser.
I do acknowledge that later Mr L indicates in later emails that he had wanted to invest 
£100,000 in B Investment at the start. But, based on all the other email evidence, and the 
phone note, Im not persuaded that he didnt agree to the £50,000 his adviser 
recommended.  
Neither Mr L nor his IFA ever mention 50% of the funds from the original investment provider 
being invested in B investment in any of the emails Ive seen. So Im persuaded that Mr L 
and his adviser had agreed that his initial strategy had changed before any money was 
invested in B investment, in light of the impact of the pandemic on investment markets. 
To reinforce this point, I note the following extracts from emails Mr L sent to his IFA: 27 
March 2020: What are your thoughts regarding investment strategy?. 
14 April 2020: Can you please update me on your investment strategy? [B investment] is up 
10% yet we only bought £50k we still have £216,000 in cash.
28 April 2020: Any thoughts on how and when we should be investing the rest £186,000 
cash?. And: I did raise concerns that we did not buy enough and mentioned at the time we 
should have bought at least £100,000. However, you advised against buying more? Lets 
monitor the situation as I do not want to buy more at current prices.
From what Ive seen, Mr Ls adviser felt that markets were going to drop further. So his 
recommendation was to wait before investing more. But he told Mr L that the decision about 
when to invest was up to him. For example, on 14 April 2020 he said: If you want me to buy 
more at current prices I will do. I can see that Mr L also said on 27 March 2020: Let me know what you decide. I think we 
should have bought more of [B investment] at least £100,000? It has already gone up 9%. 
So its clear that he regretted not buying more of B investment. But Ive not seen any 
evidence that MPA were responsible for this. Ive seen no evidence of them making an error. 
And Ive seen no evidence that they failed to follow Mr Ls updated instructions. 
But there is considerable evidence that Mr L and his IFA communicated a great deal after 
their initial January 2020 meeting. And the emails between Mr L and his IFA show that the 
instruction changed due to the volatility in investment markets at that time. I note that Mr L 
has said: I would like to state at no point did I agree with [my IFAs] decision to invest only 
£50K of the agreed £260,000 nor do I recall having any conversations giving him the 
authority to take such actions. But his IFA said: Nothing was done without his agreement. 
Mr Ls IFA also noted that MPA was happy to pay compensation where errors had been 
made. And gave the example of the compensation that had been paid to Mr L for the 
delayed £30,000 investment.
Based on the correspondence Ive seen, Im satisfied Mr L himself decided to invest £50,000 
in B investment, based on updated advice from his IFA. His IFA told him that it was up to Mr 
L when to buy more. So it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to decide that Mr Ls IFA 
made an unauthorised decision to only invest £50,000 in B investment.  And I dont uphold 
this part of Mr Ls complaint. 
Ill now look the fees MPA have charged Mr L since his complaint.
Fees charged since June 2020
Mr L complains that hes paid for a service that he hasnt received since June 2020. From 
what Ive seen, I agree that he didnt receive the full service he couldve expected as an 
MPA Private Client. From what Ive seen, theres been little to no contact between Mr L and 
his IFA since he made his complaint on 1 June 2020. Mr L continued to pay ongoing advice 
fees, but hes not received the service he couldve expected. 
MPA have agreed that they havent provided the expected service. In their final response 
letter they offered to refund the £544.98 Mr L had paid them for ongoing advice between 1 
June 2020 and 28 July 2020.
In his view, our investigator noted that MPA had also offered to refund Mr L for 50% of the 
ongoing advice fees hed paid between 28 July 2020 and 11 February 2021. This comes to 
£1,024.54.
MPA said that theyd calculated the £1024.54 as 50% of the fees theyd received over that 
period. They explained that theyd offered a 50% refund as they felt theyd provided part of 
the service Mr L couldve expected over the period in question. For example, his other 
investments were still being monitored. 
Im satisfied that while Mr L didnt receive all the service he couldve expected, he did 
receive some service. So I consider MPAs settlement offer to be fair in respect of the fees 
Mr L has been charged between June 2020 and 11 February 2021. 
But MPA have confirmed that Mr L is still a client. They note that his portfolio has increased 
considerably since February 2021, evidencing that they have provided a service. They said 
they are continuing to manage his portfolio. But said: there has not been any direct verbal 
contact from or to the Client in the time since 11 February 2021.
Mr L said: I have not had any communication whatsoever or received any ongoing advice from MPA, neither have they conducted any financial reviews which they are contracted to 
do.
Under the circumstances, I intend to ask MPA to extend the fee reduction  for the same 
reasons they offered to reduce them for the period between 28 July 2020 and 11 February 
2021  up to the date of any final decision. MPA should also add 8% simple interest per year 
on the refunded fees from the date they were paid to the date of settlement.
Based on what Ive seen, the relationship between Mr L and MPA appears to have broken 
down. It may be best for both parties if he appoints a new adviser, but that of course is up to 
him.
In summary, I know my decision will disappoint Mr L. I acknowledge that he feels our 
investigator ignored his point that the fact that his IFA called him on 17 March 2020 isnt 
proof that he authorised him to invest only £50,000. But its clear from the email history that 
Ive seen that Mr L knew in early March 2020 that only £50,000 had been invested. And 
even without the phone note Im persuaded from the emails that Mr L did agree to £50,000 
being invested. 
Response to my provisional decision
MPA accepted my provisional decision. They noted I hadnt upheld Mr Ls complaint relating 
to the investment of only £50,000. But that I had upheld the fees part of the complaint. They 
provided a calculation of the refund of fees up to 1 October 2021. They agreed that it would 
be best if Mr L appointed a new adviser. 
Mr L didnt respond to my provisional decision. Although just before it was issued he told us: 
It is my view Mpa are clearly ignoring me and are in breach of the contract we both signed 
up to.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
No new information has come to light to change my opinion. So I remain of the view I set out 
in my provisional decision.
  
Putting things right
I require MPA Financial Management Limited to do the following:
Pay Mr L £544.98 as a refund of ongoing advice fees between 1 June 2020 and 28 
July 2020, as originally offered 
Pay Mr L a refund of 50% of his ongoing advice fees between 28 July 2020 and the 
date of my final decision. 
Add 8% simple interest per year on the refunded fees from the date they were paid to 
the date of settlement.
  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint. I require MPA Financial Management 
Limited to take the action detailed in the Putting things right section above. 
  Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2021.
