K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) blocked his account and 
refused to remove the block without seeing  his identification.
background
Mr C opened a PayPal  account in 2003  and used it without issue for a number of years.  In 
July 2018, PayPal carried out a review of Mr Cs account and blocked it. PayPal asked Mr C 
to provide photographic identification  and proof  of address  in order for his account to be re-
activated.
Mr C refused to submit his identification  to PayPal through its online portal, as he considered  
doing so presented a security risk. Mr C said PayPal should verify his identity  by accessing 
his credit report. PayPal  maintained its stance so Mr C brought his complaint to us.
Our investigator said PayPal is entitled to review accounts from time to time and take action 
to fix any concerns it might have.  He felt that verifying Mr Cs identity was not an 
unreasonable request. And that PayPal was under the same obligations as any other 
financial business to keep Mr Cs information  safe. In short,  he did not think  PayPal had 
done anything  wrong.
Mr C disagreed. He said that PayPal  blocking  his account, without providing  reasonable 
notice or flagging an issue to him, was unfair. And he asked for an ombudsman to consider 
the matter afresh.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Mr C is frustrated: he operated  his account for a number of years 
without any problems. And he was not asked to provide identification when he opened his 
account, i.e. the time a consumer might  usually expect to have his or her identification 
verified. 
Mr C may also feel it was unnecessary for PayPal to block his account without giving him 
notice. And Mr C was unhappy  that PayPal didnt respond directly to his concerns or 
questions.
However, in order to uphold Mr Cs complaint, I would have to say PayPal  has done 
something wrong or acted unreasonably. Having considered the evidence,  I dont think  it 
has. And Ill explain why.
The terms of PayPals  User Agreement, which Mr C would have been  able to see when he 
opened his account, entitle it to block Mr Cs account at any time, and without liability.  This is 
a common term among banks, building societies  and other financial institutions, and is 
necessary to enable  such  companies to comply with their legal and regulatory obligations. 
I know Mr C feels  strongly  about  his complaint and I accept this has caused him 
inconvenience. But, having looked  at the evidence, I am satisfied that PayPal acted  in 
Ref: DRN57524352accordance with its terms and conditions when  it blocked Mr Cs account and sought to 
verify his identification. And so I cannot  say PayPal has done  anything wrong. 
While Mr C feels PayPal  acted unreasonably by not answering his questions, PayPals  User  
Agreement does  not oblige it to tell Mr C why it has taken such  actions or to justify  or adjust 
its procedures. PayPal  may or may not decide to engage further with Mr C once he has 
complied with its request.  But that is a matter for PayPal and not something I can reasonably  
criticise it for in the circumstances.
If Mr C does not feel comfortable uploading his identification to PayPals secure portal, he is 
of course entitled  to decline  PayPals request. But, given PayPal is operating within  its terms 
and conditions, I cannot ask it to lift the block on Mr Cs account before it has been  able to 
verify Mr Cs identity.  So if Mr C chooses not to upload  his identification, PayPal is entitled to 
maintain the block  on his account.
In summary,  I know my decision will come as a great  frustration and disappointment to 
Mr C. But, having carefully considered  the individual circumstances of this complaint, I 
havent seen anything to persuade me that PayPal has done anything  wrong  or treated Mr C 
unreasonably or unfairly.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 February  2019.
