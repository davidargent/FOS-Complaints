DRN-3563753
The complaint
E, a limited company complains that PrePay Technologies Limited (PrePay) unfairly refused 
to open a business account. 
E, through its director, Mr M, wants PrePay to apologise, explain why it refused to open the 
account and pay compensation for the time taken and the stress caused.
What happened
E applied for an account in early 2022 but PrePay declined its application. Mr M thought that 
PrePays decision might be racially motivated.
After E complained to this service, PrePay told the investigator that it rejected the application 
based on the checks that it carried out and its internal criteria. This included information from 
Cifas, the fraud prevention service. As PrePay wasnt prepared to share details of what 
evidence it had reviewed, the investigator couldnt decide whether PrePay had treated E 
fairly. So, the investigator asked PrePay to pay E £100.
PrePay doesnt agree with the investigators recommendation. It says by requiring PrePay to 
provide evidence of the information it relied on to reach its decision, this service is putting 
PrePay in an unlawful position. And that we could instead ask for the information from Cifas. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I realise that Ive summarised this complaint in less detail than the parties and Ive done so 
using my own words. Ive concentrated on what I consider to be the key issues. The rules 
that govern this service allow me to do so. But this doesnt mean that Ive not considered 
everything that both parties have given to me.
As the investigator has already explained to Mr M, E is a limited company and so, its own 
legal entity. This means I cant consider the distress that Mr M has felt personally. I also 
cant tell PrePay what processes it must follow when considering any applications for a new 
account. I can only consider whether PrePay acted fairly and reasonably towards E when 
assessing its application.
I appreciate the need for PrePay to act in line with its regulatory framework but its possible  
as weve told PrePay  for it to share information with us on a confidential basis. Without 
seeing the evidence myself, I cant reasonably find that PrePay treated E fairly and in line 
with its usual processes.
I appreciate that Mr M is concerned that racial discrimination may have played a part in 
PrePays decision to decline Es application but based on what Ive seen, I cant say this was 
the case. As the investigator told E, the reports that PrePay relied on to make its decision 
wouldnt have taken account of Mr Ms race or ethnicity. 
Cifas is a publicly searchable database, so Mr M may want to make a data subject access 
request to find out what information it holds. My understanding is that this can be done 
online via the Cifas website. But just because its possible for Mr M to ask for this 
information, doesnt mean that PrePay shouldnt have shared it with this service in the first 
place.
Overall, I agree with the investigator that its reasonable to require PrePay to pay E £100 
compensation in recognition of the uncertainty E has been left with about the reasons its 
application failed. Although Mr M wanted PrePay to pay significantly more than this, I think 
£100 is fair and reasonable  particularly as I cant compensate Mr M for any upset thats 
been caused to him personally.
Putting things right
I require PrePay Technologies Limited to pay E £100.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I require PrePay 
Technologies Limited to pay E £100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask E to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 September 2022.
