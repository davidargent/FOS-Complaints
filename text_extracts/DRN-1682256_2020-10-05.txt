The complaint
Mrs F complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
FCE Bank plc, trading as Ford Credit, wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mrs F under a hire purchase agreement with Ford Credit 
that she electronically signed in October 2018;
Mrs F complained to the dealer, to Ford Credit, and then to the manufacturer, about 
some issues with the car;
although those issues couldnt be replicated by the dealer and it said there was no 
fault with the car, the manufacturer agreed to buy the car back at the original price, 
less a charge of £1,756.51 for the 9,208 miles that shed driven in the car and the 
outstanding finance of £20,924.44 (which was settled)  which left a balance of 
£7,734.01 that was paid to Mrs F in November 2019;
Ford Credit had applied a late payment fee of £12 to the account and had recorded a 
late payment marker on her credit file  so there was an outstanding balance of £12 
on Mrs Fs account;
the investigator said that it seemed likely that there was an intermittent fault with the 
car so it wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mrs F  but she said 
that the £7,734.01 that Mrs F received from the manufacturer was more than she 
would have recommended that Ford Credit should pay her in these circumstances so 
she didnt think it'd be fair to ask it to pay anything further to Mrs F;
but she recommended that it should remove any adverse information about the 
agreement that it had recorded on Mrs Fs credit file and that it should remove the 
£12 outstanding balance on the account;
I agree with the investigator that the actions taken by the manufacturer are more than 
I would have required Ford Credit to do in these circumstances  so I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Ford Credit to pay any further 
compensation to Mrs F;
Ford Credit has explained in detail why it added a late payment fee to Mrs Fs 
account and recorded a late payment marker on her credit file  and I understand the 
reasons that it did so;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances - although we do take account of applicable law and 
regulations we also consider the overall situation, so its possible that a court would 
reach a different outcome to the decision that Ive made; and
I dont consider that its fair or reasonable in these circumstances for Mrs F to be 
charged £12 for the late payment or for the late payment marker to be recorded on 
her credit file.
IPutting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Ford Credit to waive the £12 late payment fee 
that its charged to Mrs Fs account and that it should remove any adverse information about 
the hire purchase agreement that its recorded on her credit file. But I dont consider that it 
would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to take any other action in response to her 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Fs complaint and I order FCE Bank plc, trading as Ford 
Credit, to:
1. Waive the £12 late payment fee that its charged to Mrs Fs account.
2. Remove any adverse information about the hire purchase agreement that its 
recorded on Mrs Fs credit file.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 November 2020.
