K820x#14complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc has placed a block on his credit  card 
and wont remove it until he calls. 
background
Mr A has a credit card with NatWest and in 2016  it put a security block on his account  
because of concerns  over potential fraud.  
In 2018 Mr A tried to use his credit card again but wasnt able to do so because  of the 
security block  that remained in place. 
Mr A complained and NatWest responded explaining that he needed  to telephone and 
discuss his account  in order for the block to be removed. NatWest  provided Mr A with the 
numbers he can call. 
Mr A referred his complaint to this service and an adjudicator looked at it. They  checked with 
NatWest and it confirmed  it would accept reverse charges if Mr A didnt want  to pay for the 
call. The adjudicator thought NatWests request for Mr A to call was fair so didnt ask it to do 
anything else to resolve his complaint. Mr A didnt  accept the adjudicators  view of his 
complaint so its been passed to me to make  a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr A lives abroad and I appreciate theres  a time difference  that makes calling less 
convenient. Mr As also said that because of his age he doesnt like using the telephone. But 
even taking Mr As comments on board I dont think NatWests request  that he calls it to 
remove the account block is unfair. Ill explain  why. 
The security  block was originally placed on Mr As credit  card in 2016  because NatWest had 
some concerns over the security of the account. I appreciate Mr As comments  that hes 
never been the subject of fraud but NatWest is obliged to monitor  account activity  and put 
security measures in place if its concerned about  the possibility of fraud. Whilst Mr As 
account may not have actually fallen victim  to fraud, NatWest is allowed to put a block in 
place if it thinks theres  a risk that could happen.  
In this case, Im satisfied  that NatWest acted reasonably by putting the block  on Mr As credit 
card in 2016 because it was concerned  about  fraud.  
In order to remove the block Mr A will have to answer some security questions. Part of that 
process requires Mr A to call the relevant team  at NatWest and provide information to it. I 
appreciate Mr A says he doesnt like using the phone but I have to balance that against 
NatWests obligation  to handle accounts securely. Im sorry to disappoint Mr A but I dont 
think NatWests request that he call to discuss his account is unreasonably inconvenient, 
especially considering  its offered  to pay the call costs. 
Taking into account everything  Ive seen, Im satisfied NatWest has dealt  with Mr As 
complaint fairly and that its request that he calls its security teams  to remove the account 
Ref: DRN66816832block is reasonable. As a result, Im not telling NatWest to take any further action to resolve 
this complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  Under the rules of the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or reject  my decision 
before 19 March 2019.
