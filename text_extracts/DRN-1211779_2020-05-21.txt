DRN-1211779
The complaint
Miss T complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC closed her current account without informing 
her. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
We look at each complaint individually so my decision focuses on whether Barclays 
treated Miss T fairly and in line with the account terms. 
Barclays' account terms say it can close a dormant account by providing two months 
written notice. Ive seen the letter Barclays sent Miss T in 2017 and I can see it gave 
her three months notice of its intention to close the account. Barclays says it can 
make a current account dormant after a period of 18 months without any activity. I'm 
satisfied Barclays' decision to make Miss T's account dormant was in line with its 
policy.
Miss Ts money was not lost and she has been able to recover it. There is no 
financial loss to Miss T in this case. 
Barclays offered Miss T Â£100 because of the service she received when she 
complained. As I havent found anything to show Barclays made a mistake or treated 
Miss T unfairly by closing her dormant current account, Im not telling it to take any 
further action. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2020.
