Complaint
Mr H has complained that Loans 2 Go Limited (L2G) provided him with an unaffordable 
loan. 
Background
L2G provided Mr H with a loan of £1,000.00 in March 2021. This loan had an APR of 770% 
and an 18-month term. This all meant the total amount repayable of £3.700.08, which 
included interest, fees and charges of £2,700.08 was due to be repaid in 18 monthly 
instalments of £205.56.
One of our adjudicators looked at this complaint and thought that L2G unfairly provided this 
loan to Mr H as proportionate checks would have shown it was unaffordable. 
L2G disagreed with our adjudicator and asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending -
including the key rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. And Ive
referred to this when deciding Mr Hs complaint.
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr Hs complaint. These two
questions are:
1. Did L2G complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr H 
would be able to repay his loan in a sustainable way?
o If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
o If not, would those checks have shown that Mr H wouldve been able to do 
so?
2. Did L2G act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Did L2G complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr H would be 
able to repay his loan in a sustainable way?
L2G provided this loan while it was authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). The rules and regulations in place required L2G to carry out a reasonable 
and proportionate assessment of Mr Hs ability to make the repayments under this 
agreement. This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or 
affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower focused  so L2G had to think about whether repaying the 
loan would cause significant adverse consequences for Mr H. In practice this meant that 
L2G had to ensure that making the payments to the loan wouldnt cause Mr H undue 
difficulty or adverse consequences.
In other words, it wasnt enough for L2G to simply think about the likelihood of
it getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr H.
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount / type / cost of credit they are seeking.
Even for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different
applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the longer the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit is
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make payments for an extended 
period); and
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed a proportionate check
shouldve been for a given loan application  including (but not limited to) any indications of
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in future circumstances.
Ive carefully thought about all of the relevant factors in this case.
Were L2Gs checks reasonable and proportionate?
L2G says that it carried out an income and expenditure assessment with Mr H prior to 
providing him with this loan. It also carried out a credit check. L2G determined that Mr H was 
earning around £1,750.00 a month. L2G also determined that Mr H had expenditure of approaching £1,400.00 a month. In its view, this left Mr H with enough to be able to make 
the payments to this loan. 
Ive carefully considered what L2G has said. But the credit check it carried out showed Mr H 
was already significantly indebted. He was also close the credit limit on a revolving credit 
account. L2G has argued that the purpose of this loan was debt consolidation. 
But Ive not seen anything to support this was the case. In any event, as there is no 
indication of which debts Mr H was going to consolidate, its unclear to me how or what was 
going to be consolidated and more crucially how this was going to improve Mr Hs already 
precarious financial position going forward.
Bearing in mind all of this, I think that L2G needed to take steps to verify Mr Hs actual 
monthly expenditure. To be clear its not the 18-month term on its own that leads me to think 
L2G needed to do more, its the combination of this together with what Mr Hs credit file 
showed which persuades me it would have been reasonable and proportionate to have 
taken this course of action here.
As I cant see that this L2G did take further steps to verify Mr Hs actual expenditure, I dont 
think that the checks it carried out before providing Mr H with his loan were reasonable and 
proportionate.
Would reasonable and proportionate checks have indicated to L2G that Mr H would have 
been unable to repay this loan?
As reasonable and proportionate checks werent carried out before this loan was provided,
I cant say for sure what they wouldve shown. So I need to decide whether it is more likely
than not that a proportionate check would have told L2G that Mr H would have been unable 
to sustainably repay this loan.
I think its worth me explaining that L2G was required to establish whether Mr H could make 
his loan repayments without experiencing significant adverse consequences  not just 
whether the loan payments were technically affordable on a strict pounds and pence 
calculation.
Having considered the information provided, Im satisfied that Mr H was struggling to 
manage his existing commitments. So I think that proportionate checks would have shown 
L2G that Mr H was likely to use this loan to continue a cycle of unsustainable credit, which 
meant he was unlikely to be able to repay it without borrowing further or suffering significant 
adverse consequences.
Bearing all of this in mind, Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would
more likely than not have demonstrated that Mr H would not have been able to make the
repayments to this loan without borrowing further and/or suffering undue difficulty. And, in 
these circumstances, I find that reasonable and proportionate checks would more likely than 
not have alerted L2G to the fact that Mr H was in no sort of position to make the payments 
on this loan without suffering significant adverse consequences.
Did L2G act unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr H in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about everything provided. And having done so, Ive not seen anything 
to suggest that L2G acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr H in some other way. So I 
dont think L2G acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr H in some other way.Did Mr H lose out as a result of L2G unfairly providing him with this loan?
As Mr H has paid and is being expected to pay a high amount of interest and charges on a 
loan that he shouldnt have been provided with, Im satisfied that he has lost out as a result 
of what L2G did wrong.
So I think that L2G needs to put things right.
Fair compensation  what L2G needs to do to put things right for Mr H
Having thought about everything, L2G should put things right for Mr H by:
refunding all interest, fees and charges Mr H paid on his loan;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Mr H to the date of settlement
removing any and all adverse information in may have recorded about this loan from 
Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires L2G to take off tax from this interest. L2G must give    
Mr H a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Hs complaint. Loans 2 Go Limited needs to 
put things right in the way set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 October 2023.
