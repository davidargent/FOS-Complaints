The complaint
Mr J is unhappy with Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money for failing to provide 
him with a written settlement figure for his personal loan. He thinks he has lost out financially 
as a result of this and has been inconvenienced. 
What happened
Mr J had a loan with 118 118 Money. He requested a settlement figure for this loan at the 
beginning of April 2020. The figure he was provided was £1,527.47. Mr J says the call 
handler told him he needed to wait for the settlement figure in writing before he could repay 
the loan. Mr J says he was able to repay the loan at that time. Mr J says the call handler 
explained there would be a delay in sending written confirmation of the figure but confirmed 
Mr J would receive the figure in writing before May 2020. This settlement figure never 
arrived.
Mr J then contacted 118 118 Money again in May 2020 to express his concerns and was 
told it recognised the settlement figure was never sent. 118 118 Money said he would 
receive an amended settlement figure that month. Mr J explained he would have incurred 
£80 or so additional interest but. Mr J says he was led to believe this would be taken into 
consideration. Then on 22 May 2020, Mr J received a settlement figure via email. This figure 
was the same as was given when he first called up in April 2020 and stated it expired on 
14 May 2020 - so before the email was sent.
Mr J then contacted 118 118 Money again via live chat and the complaint was raised. Mr J 
had to make another payment in June 2020 towards the loan. The loan was finally settled in 
June 2020 when 118 118 Money took a payment over the phone, but Mr J is unhappy that 
he didnt receive the settlement figures in writing that he asked for - and as a result had to 
make two additional monthly repayments to the loan, which caused him to incur additional 
interest. He doesnt think this is fair and says he should be reimbursed his loss due to 118 
118 Moneys error.
118 118 Money accepts it failed to email a copy of the settlement figure to Mr J due to 
technical issues, it insists its call handler provided Mr J with the full settlement figure over the 
phone in April 2020 and that he could have made the payment at any time prior to the expiry 
date of the settlement figure. Because he didnt, it isnt willing to offer any refund. 
The investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. The investigator had listened to 
the call of 16 April 2020 between Mr J and 118 118 Money. In this call Mr J requested the 
settlement figure and was provided with it verbally. He was told the expiry date, the rebate 
hed receive and that if his May 2020 payment was made, this would be deducted from the 
settlement figure if payment was made before the expiry date  which he was told was 
14 May 2020. Mr J was also told by the call handler that he could not guarantee when the 
settlement quote could be sent to Mr J and asked him to make a note of the settlement 
figure on the call. The investigator said that having listened to the call, he could confirm that 
at no point did the call handler say Mr J could not or should not pay the settlement figure 
before receiving it in writing. The call handler repeated several times that he couldnt 
guarantee when Mr J would receive the email containing his settlement figure.
From what the investigator could see, there was then no further contact between Mr J and 
118 118 Money until 22 May 2020  more than a week after the settlement figure hed been 
provided with had expired. The investigator could see no evidence that Mr J contacted 
118 118 Money between 16 April 2020 and 14 May 2020 to chase the written confirmation of 
the settlement figure hed asked for. Although 118 118 Money normally would have emailed 
the settlement figure to him when he asked, there were technical reasons why this didnt 
happen. The investigator felt these technical issues were also responsible for the fact that 
Mr J received the old settlement figure in writing after it had expired  which was clearly an 
error.
The investigator didnt think 118 118 Moneys failure to send the settlement figure in writing 
prevented Mr J from paying the settlement figure hed been provided. He understood Mr J 
mightve been reluctant to pay the settlement figure without receiving it in writing, but he 
didnt appear to have chased the written settlement figure up when he didnt receive it. It was 
not clear to the investigator why Mr J waited until after the figure had expired to contact 
118 118 Money again.
On 22 May 2020, the investigator could see Mr J was provided with a new settlement figure 
but was unhappy that this didnt consider his May 2020 payment and resulted in him paying 
more interest than hed been quoted in the earlier settlement figure. He raised a complaint. A 
further payment was then taken on 1 June 2020.
The investigator felt he couldnt reasonably say 118 118 Money wasnt entitled to collect the 
May and June 2020 payments as those were collected in line with the loan agreement. Mr J 
eventually paid the settlement figure he was provided with on 23 June 2020 over the phone, 
and the loan is now settled.
The investigator didnt feel Mr J was out of pocket because of 118 118 Moneys actions.
Mr J felt the investigator had totally missed the point of the complaint. He said he had the 
money to repay the loan from making the first call. At no stage was he given the opportunity 
to repay it. He said the call handler couldnt take payment over the phone. So, if he couldnt 
why would Mr J think others could before he received the settlement figure? He said he was
steered incorrectly and that he made the initial call to repay the loan.
The investigator responded to say that Mr J didnt ask to pay off the loan in the first call and 
the call handler at no point said they couldnt take a payment over the phone then and there.
My provisional decision
I didnt agree entirely with the investigators view, so I issued a provisional decision. 
I said like the investigator I had listened carefully to the April 2020 call between Mr J and 
118 118 Money. Having done so I was satisfied that Mr J left the call knowing how much he 
needed to pay to redeem his loan, when that payment needed to be received and that this 
might not be confirmed in writing. I was satisfied that Mr Js recollection of the call was 
wrong. 118 118 Money didnt tell him that he needed to have the settlement figure confirmed 
in writing nor did it say it couldnt take payment over the phone.
I thought it was most likely that had Mr J tried to pay off the loan by phone before the initial 
expiry date all would have gone through fine and Mr J would have reduced the amount of 
interest he had to pay and would have suffered less inconvenience.I agreed with the investigator that Mr J could have done more to ensure that he got the 
written confirmation if it was that important to him. Having read the correspondence between 
Mr J and 118 118 Money I thought Mr J was confident that 118 118 Money was in the wrong 
and so he didnt need to do anything, and he would not lose out. I explained that wasnt how 
we look at things. We do expect a customer to try to resolve things if they reasonably can. 
Having said all that, I recognised that some people, and I thought Mr J is one of them, are 
much more comfortable when they have things in writing that they can carefully consider and 
check. I also felt it was unfair that 118 118 Money couldnt provide Mr J with its usual service 
and as a result he ended up paying more than he would have done if it had provided that 
usual service. And that Mr J was put to additional inconvenience. I thought it was fair that 
118 118 Money reimburse Mr J half of the additional interest he paid (so half of the interest 
payable from 14 May 2020 until 23 June 2020) and that it pays him a further £50 to 
compensate him for the inconvenience caused to him.
Responses to my provisional decision
Mr J didnt respond.
118 118 Money did respond. It said whilst it appreciates that Mr J wanted the figures in 
writing, it thinks it is important to keep in mind that at this time, it was unable to honour this 
request due to its networks being taken offline following a cyber-attack. It says this meant it 
couldnt provide the quote in writing. It notes it did provide a written figure when it received a 
later request, but Mr J didnt pay the loan off before this quote expired.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate 118 118 Money taking the time to respond to my provisional decision, but it 
hasnt told me anything new. I did already know about the cyber-attack and it doesnt change 
my mind. Nor does what it has said about what happened after the quote wasnt given. Mr J 
isnt responsible for the challenges 118 118 Money faced as a result of the cyber-attack. I 
think if he had received in writing the quote to pay off his loan when he first requested it then 
I think he would have paid it off before that quote expired. Not getting the quote in writing 
therefore cost him money. Given this fact I think the settlement I suggested in my provisional 
decision is fair for the reasons I set out more fully in my provisional decision.
Putting things right
To put things right 118 118 Money should reimburse Mr J for half the interest he paid from 
14 May 2020 to 23 June 2020 and pay him £50.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and order that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money:
Reimburse Mr J for half the interest he paid for the period of the loan from 
14 May 2020 to 23 June 2020; and
Pay him £50 for the additional inconvenience.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 February 2021.
