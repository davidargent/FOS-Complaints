The complaint
Miss P complains about the errors made by National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) after 
she received an unknown credit in her current account. Shes also unhappy with the service 
she received when trying to resolve the matter. 
  
What happened
The detailed background to this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide 
an overview of some key events here. 
On 5 May 2020, Miss P received a credit for £744 into her current account which she didnt 
recognise. She contacted NatWest to inform them of this and to ask for further details about 
the credit. NatWest initially asked that Miss P check that it wasnt from someone she knew 
before later sharing that the payment had arrived from another bank  who Ill refer to as B. 
They suggested she could approach B to find out more. Miss P contacted B but was told 
they couldnt share any of their customers information due to data protection reasons. 
Around this time Miss P also received a call from someone claiming to be from NatWest. 
They discussed the credit into her account, and she was told someone would be in touch a 
few days later. Miss P says she checked the phone number shed been given on the internet 
and found it was linked to scams. She contacted NatWest and was given conflicting 
information about whether or not that call had really originated within NatWest. 
Miss P then received a complaint acknowledgment from NatWest. This was confusing as 
she hadnt raised a complaint. So, she contacted NatWest again and found that the 
complaint response had been sent to her in error. It was intended for another customer of 
theirs who shares Miss Ps name. They apologised and deleted the complaint from Miss Ps 
profile. 
Miss P then complained to NatWest herself. She didnt feel confident that her account was 
secure, and she took steps to protect her funds such as lowering her accounts overdraft 
limit and resetting her online banking details. 
NatWest accepted that theyd made errors and had provided poor service. They explained 
that theyd shared Miss Ps sort code and account number with another customer with a 
similar name. And this is why the credit had initially arrived in her account. They also 
explained that theyd recorded a complaint against the wrong customer profile too. They 
apologised and offered £150 compensation for the impact of this. 
Miss P wasnt happy. She felt shed been put through quite an ordeal and so she 
approached our service. 
One of our investigators looked into Miss Ps concerns. She shared with Miss P why in error, 
her account details were given to another account holder. She also said she didnt think the 
amount NatWest had offered in compensation fairly reflected the trouble and upset caused. 
She concluded NatWest should pay another £150 bringing the total amount to £300. 
NatWest agreed to pay in line with the investigators recommendations, but Miss P didnt 
agree and asked for an ombudsman to review her complaint. She says NatWest hasnt 
provided her with the information requested, and she maintained the level of compensation 
recommended didnt fairly reflect the substantial impact on her.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Firstly, Id like to explain that it isnt the role of our service to decide if a business has 
breached their data protection obligations as that is the role of the Information 
Commissioners Office (ICO). If Miss P believes that to be the case, she can contact the 
ICO. But we can consider the impact any error by NatWest has had on Miss P. And so it is 
within my power to look into Miss Ps complaint about the service she received from 
NatWest and the distress and inconvenience their errors have caused her. 
Its clear numerous errors were made by NatWest which directly caused distress to Miss P. 
NatWest provided another customer with Miss Ps account details in order to receive a 
credit. She was given conflicting information; and it took several months for the error to come 
to light.  
It is accepted by NatWest that Miss P received poor service. They have apologised and paid 
£150 compensation. The investigator didnt think the amount paid fairly reflected the distress 
caused and recommended NatWest increase the total amount to £300. Both parties agree 
the service provided fell below the standards that could reasonably be expected. I now need 
to decide if the compensation recommended is fair or whether NatWest need to do more. 
Having carefully considered the available information, I agree with the investigators 
recommendation that NatWest should pay an additional £150 compensation to Miss P, 
bringing the total award to £300. I know Miss P wasnt happy with this as resolution to her 
complaint , so Id like to explain why Ive come to this decision.
I appreciate that the error caused Miss P to be concerned about the safety of her account as 
she wasnt expecting a payment. The information provided by NatWest shows no other 
details apart from the account number and sort code were shared with the other customer. 
Given the circumstances of why the details were shared with another customer I think this 
was a genuine mistake on NatWests part and theyve apologised for this. 
Miss P was also given conflicting information. She made several calls to NatWest to try and 
get to the bottom of the matter, she was concerned fraud had happened on her account or 
that shed shared her details with another party that put her account at risk. I also 
acknowledge the steps she took after NatWest provided her with information on how to 
protect her account from frauds and scams. 
NatWest has said that the agents Miss P would have spoken with at the time wouldnt have 
known about the error when she initially called them to enquire about the credit. I know this 
caused Miss P some inconvenience but considering the information that wouldve been 
available at the time I dont think NatWest acted unreasonably when asking Miss P to check 
her records to see if she recognised the payer. 
But I do think NatWest gave Miss P incorrect advice when they asked her to contact B  
because NatWest ought to have known due to Data Protection regulations, B would have 
been limited in the information they were able to share. I think NatWest shouldve looked into the credit in more detail and this may have allowed the 
error to come to light sooner and alleviated some of the concerns Miss P had at the time. 
I can see that when NatWest became aware of the error, they raised it with their internal 
data privacy team and explained they will look into this internally. But Miss P isnt happy 
NatWest hasnt gone into much detail of what this entails. 
I also appreciate the complaint that was incorrectly logged against Miss Ps profile may have 
caused further confusion. Ive seen that NatWest took appropriate action by deleting the 
complaint from her profile. I understand Miss P would like details of this complaint but Im 
satisfied NatWest isnt required to share its content because it isnt a complaint she raised.
I can quite understand Miss Ps desire to know the specific details of what went wrong and 
how. But I dont think it is always necessary (or even possible) for NatWest to provide the 
level of detail and the type of explanation Miss P would like. It will inevitably involve the data 
of other parties and potentially details of their own processes. And whilst I dont believe that 
Miss P is in any way dishonest, if that information were to be put in the public domain, some 
of it may be of use to those seeking to exploit the banks systems.  So in the circumstances 
here  I dont think NatWest have to provide a further explanation  Im satisfied what they 
have shared and the compensation proposed is a fair way to resolve this complaint. 
Overall, NatWest has accepted things went wrong and has taken appropriate action, and 
theyve agreed to pay Miss P a further £150 compensation. Although Miss P would like more 
information, I hope Ive explained why I dont think NatWest need to provide this. I do agree 
NatWest made several errors and Miss P has received poor service, and for this reason I 
think £300 in total is fair compensation.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and National Westminster Bank Plc is 
required to pay Miss P £150 in addition to the £150 already paid, bringing the total 
compensation to £300.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 5 August 2021.
