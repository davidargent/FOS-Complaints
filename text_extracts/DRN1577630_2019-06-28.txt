K821x#15complaint
Mr T complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.  
background
Mr T took out 16 loans  with QuickQuid between December 2015 and September  2018.  He 
topped up 11 of the loans  by taking additional  borrowing. On five of the loans,  Mr T deferred 
repayment. A summary of Mr Ts borrowing with QuickQuid is shown as an appendix  to this 
decision. 
One of our adjudicators assessed  Mr Ts complaint.  She thought  that QuickQuid shouldnt 
have given Mr T loans four to 16. The adjudicator set out what  QuickQuid  should  do to put 
things right. 
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment. As the complaint hasnt been 
resolved informally, it was passed  to me, an ombudsman, to decide. This is the last stage of 
our process. If Mr T accepts my decision its legally binding  on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr T 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN15776302I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
In relation to loans  one to three, given the amount of the loans, what  was apparent about 
Mr Ts circumstances  at the time and his history  with QuickQuid  at that stage,  I dont think  it 
wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask Mr T for the amount of information needed 
to show the lending was unsustainable.  There wasnt anything in the information  Mr T 
provided or the information QuickQuid shouldve  been aware of, which meant  that QuickQuid 
should have looked more  closely  at Mr Ts actual financial situation at that stage. So, I dont 
think that QuickQuid  acted unfairly  in giving Mr T loans one to three.  
But Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern of Mr Ts lending history with QuickQuid,  with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ts case,  I think that this point was reached  by loan 
four. I say this because  by then, Mr Ts overall pattern of borrowing  suggested  that he had 
become persistently reliant on short-term loans.  He had borrowed from QuickQuid for over 
seven months. Whilst the amounts Mr T borrowed fluctuated,  the amount he was borrowing 
didnt decrease  significantly over this period and for the rest of the borrowing relationship. 
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed  QuickQuid. Loan 16 was taken 
out two years and nine months after Mr Ts first  loan  with QuickQuid. Mr T had paid large 
amounts of interest  to, in effect, service an intermittent debt to QuickQuid  over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr T lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan four 
onwards because these loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time. And the sheer number of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ts ability to access mainstream credit and so potentially kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So I dont  think that QuickQuid should have  given Mr T loans four to 16 and QuickQuid 
should put things right.
Ref: DRN15776303putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans  four to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan four onwards means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans four to 16 should be removed from 
Mr Ts credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr T a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Ts complaint in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC, 
trading as QuickQuid  should put things  right as Ive set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 July 2019.
