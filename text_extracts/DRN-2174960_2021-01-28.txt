The complaint
Mr M says PDL Finance Limited, trading as Mr Lender, lent to him irresponsibly. He 
said he applied for one loan after another and drove himself deeper into debt. This 
adversely affected his finances and his life.
What happened
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be partially upheld. Mr Lender disagreed with 
the adjudicators opinion. The complaint was then passed to me. 
I issued my provisional decision saying that Mr Ms complaint shouldnt be upheld. A copy of 
the background to the complaint and my provisional findings are below in italics: 
This complaint is about three payday loans, and six instalment loans, Mr Lender provided to Mr M 
between September 2013 and October 2019.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought Mr Lender shouldnt have approved 
loans 7 to 9. Mr Lender disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. As no agreement has been 
reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - 
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M could repay 
the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was being 
lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the 
early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive provisionally decided not to uphold Mr Ms complaint and Ive explained why below.
Looking at the lending pattern here I can see that Mr M would typically take a small amount of 
loans and then there would be a significant break in lending. And even when he was taking loans 
regularly there were usually some smaller breaks in the lending.
I think its reasonable to say that new lending periods, or chains, start at loans 1, 4 and 5. So Mr 
Lender could think at these times that Mr Ms financial situation would probably have improved and 
it could treat him the same way it would a new customer before approving these loans. So the 
checks it made could be lower at this point.
And because of the breaks, particularly the break of over four months between loans 8 and 9, I 
dont think its fair to say that Mr M had become persistently reliant on this lending at any point. It 
looks more like he was using the lending for shorter periods to help with cash flow problems. And 
then not borrowing when things improved.
Ive seen a record of the information Mr M provided when he completed all of his loan 
applications. Mr M typically said he had a monthly income of around £2,000 at the start of the 
lending rising to £2,500 for the later loans. And he had regular monthly outgoings of around 
£400 at the start of the lending and around £1,250 for the later loans. So all of the loan 
repayments wouldve seemed affordable to Mr Lender.
I havent seen any further information that shows its likely Mr Lender was made aware of any 
financial problems Mr M mightve been having. Or anything that wouldve prompted it to investigate 
Mr Ms circumstances further. So I think it was reasonable for Mr Lender to rely on the information it 
obtained.
It could be that for some of the later loans Mr Lender should have done more to see if Mr M could 
sustainably make these repayments. But Mr M hasnt provided any further information that would 
allow me to say that Mr Lender wouldve seen the loans werent affordable.
So overall, in these circumstances, I think the assessments Mr Lender did for these loans were 
proportionate. And I think Mr Lenders decisions to approve these loans was reasonable and 
Im not upholding Mr Ms complaint about them.
I appreciate this will be a disappointment to Mr M. And Im happy to consider any further 
information he may provide in due course.
Mr Lender, and Mr M, received my provisional decision. And no one had anything to add 
after theyd seen it.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Lender and Mr M didnt raise any new points for me to consider after receiving my 
provisional decision. So, I see no reason to depart from the findings I made in the provisional 
decision and I still dont think Mr Lender was wrong to have provided Mr M with the loans. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 February 2021.
