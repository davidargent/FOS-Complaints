The complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) blocked his credit card 
account without notification which caused him to be delayed for a medical appointment.
What happened
Mr B says a transaction he made in June 2020 was blocked without notification. He says he 
repays his account balance in full every month and didnt receive any contact from NatWest 
before the transaction was blocked. Mr B says this caused him to be late for a medical 
appointment and caused him stress. He says he pays for the credit card account and would 
like a refund of its annual fee.
NatWest says the account block was put in place following security concerns and removed 
about 30 minutes later. It says it hasnt made a mistake and tried to call Mr B and sent him a 
text message after the block was put in place. NatWest says it resolved matters with Mr B 
during a call between them.
Mr B brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought NatWest had sent Mr B a text message and tried to call him about the transaction. 
The investigator also thought NatWest had a duty to protect Mr Bs account and didnt act 
unreasonably by placing the account block in these circumstances.
Mr B doesnt accept that view and disputes matters were resolved during the call he had with 
NatWest. He says this block was not the first time it has happened and says NatWest 
doesnt communicate effectively and hasnt provided the service he pays for.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint.
I am sure Mr B appreciates that fraud is a major problem for banks and building societies 
and that they must have anti-fraud measures in place. I accept that on occasions, as here, 
legitimate customers can be caused inconvenience by the placing of restrictions or account 
blocks. But Im satisfied the account terms and conditions. which I find Mr B would have 
agreed to when the account was opened, make clear that NatWest may block or refuse to 
make a transaction where it has reasonable security and fraud concerns.
Im satisfied that is what took place here, that for whatever reason, the transaction Mr B tried 
to make led to security concerns. I make clear that its not our role to tell NatWest how it 
operates its security and fraud process and such matters are for NatWest to decide upon 
when exercising its commercial judgement. It follows that I dont think NatWest made a 
mistake or acted unfairly by blocking Mr Bs transactions and find it is entitled to do so in line 
with agreed account terms and conditions. Having looked at NatWests records Im satisfied 
it tried to call Mr B about the transaction and sent him a text message about it a short while 
later. So, I think NatWest did carry out reasonable steps to establish if the transaction was 
authorised and I think in any event the block was removed after a relatively short time.
I have made clear that I accept Mr B was caused inconvenience at a time when he was due 
to attend a medical appointment. But I dont find that was as a result of a NatWest mistake 
and I also think some form of inconvenience is inevitable in these circumstances.
I have listened to the call between NatWest and Mr B some fours days after the account 
block and I appreciate why Mr B says he didnt think matters were resolved on that call. I 
think Mr B made clear that he wished to complain about what took place and said he wished 
that complaint to be logged. I dont think that issue justifies any compensation and I dont 
think it likely NatWests stance would have changed even if it sent Mr B a final response 
letter to his complaint, but I appreciate his frustration in those circumstances.
Overall, I dont think NatWest has acted unfairly or made a mistake. I find its up to NatWest 
to decide how it communicates with its customers in these circumstances and not something 
I can fairly interfere in. I appreciate Mr B is unlikely to accept my decision, but I think this 
brings an end to what we in trying to resolve this complaint informally can do. For those 
reasons I cant fairly order NatWest to refund the account fee as Mr B would like.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 February 2021.
