The complaint
Mrs P complains that Everyday Lending Limited trading as TrustTwo caused arrears to the 
loan account she was a guarantor for. This was after shed said any shortfall in payment 
could be taken from her debit card. She also said TrustTwo had constantly called her when 
they didnt need to.
What happened
TrustTwo agreed a loan of £4,000 for Mrs Ps son in February 2018. The monthly repayment 
was £185.27 over a term of 40 months. Mrs P signed a guarantee and an indemnity 
agreement which bound her to make repayments for the loan if her son didnt.
When her son fell into financial difficulty, he set up a debt management arrangement (DMA). 
Mrs P agreed to pay any shortfall between the agreed monthly repayment of £185.27 and 
the amount paid through the DMA. Mrs P said she gave TrustTwo permission to take any 
shortfall payment from the debit card details shed given to them. But she said TrustTwo kept 
contacting her for payment. And their inability to take the correct payments caused the 
account to fall into arrears. She complained to TrustTwo.
TrustTwo apologised for the issues with the loan account. And to compensate Mrs P for 
times when they should have called about the arrears, they offered her £50.
Mrs P accepted the £50 payment for the phone calls. But didnt think TrustTwo had dealt 
with her complaint about the arrears. She referred her complaint to us.
Our investigator said that the shortfall varied each month dependent on the DMA, and the 
account would fall into arrears until the shortfall in payment was made. But he said the 
service provided by TrustTwo could have been better. And that the £50 offered by TrustTwo 
was fair and reasonable.
Mrs P didnt agree she said TrustTwo should have done more to prevent the constant calls 
made to her, when shed already agreed to cover any shortfall. She asked for an 
ombudsman to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
Mrs Ps complaint falls into the following two areas: the accuracy of the loan account 
balance; and the upset caused by the constant phone calls asking her to pay any shortfall.
The repayment for the loan was made by a payment under a DMA with the difference 
covered by Mrs P. I can see from TrustTwos records that the repayments from the DMA 
were irregular both in amount and frequency. Something which I dont think TrustTwo could 
control. 
TrustTwo has shown that for some months they didnt receive a payment from the DMA or 
the payment was higher/lower than it should have been. This meant the shortfall Mrs P paid 
would vary. TrustTwo has confirmed that theyd Mrs Ps debit card details on record and 
these were entered onto their manual payments spreadsheet. This meant any payment 
taken from her debit card had to be done manually by one of their agents and this could 
result in different payment collection dates depending on weekends and bank holidays. So, 
the loan account would show as in arrears until the manual payment was collected.
I can understand Mrs Ps frustration as shed given permission to TrustTwo to take any 
shortfall payments. But I cant say TrustTwo acted unfairly or unreasonably when the 
account fell into arrears as this was in the main due to the late or non-payment of the DMA. 
But there was on occasion a failed payment made by Mrs P and a change to her card details 
which meant TrustTwo called her. I can also see that TrustTwo agreed to stop further calls 
being made.
 
TrustTwo has confirmed that the loan account has been settled and there are no arrears 
outstanding. I can also see that after Mrs P settled the account, a refund was made by 
TrustTwo as theyd received two further payments from the DMA.
As there was often a shortfall in the payment being received by TrustTwo I cant say they 
acted unfairly by seeking to collect the monthly loan commitment. But I can also see that for 
Mrs P, when shed given permission to TrustTwo to take any shortfall, why there was a need 
for them to contact her each time. TrustTwo accepts their service has fallen short of what it 
should be on this occasion. And have offered Mrs P £50 to compensate her for this which I 
think is a fair and reasonable offer. 
My final decision
My final decision is that Everyday Lending trading as TrustTwo has made a fair offer.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 January 2022.
