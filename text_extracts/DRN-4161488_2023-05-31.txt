The complaint
Miss OR and Miss JR have complained that Accord Mortgages Limited would not allow them 
to make an overpayment of £30,000 to their mortgage on 28 February 2022. 
After the complaint was raised, Accord agreed to apply an overpayment 10% of the account 
balance (approximately £21,000) without it being counted towards the 2022 annual 
allowance. However, Miss OR and Miss JR said theyd actually wanted to pay £30,000 and 
want Accord to agree to allow them to pay this extra amount and backdate it without 
incurring an early repayment charge (ERC).
Miss OR and Miss JR have been assisted in their complaint by a family member, but for 
clarity I will refer to Miss OR and Miss JR throughout.
What happened
Miss OR and Miss JR have a joint mortgage with Accord, held on a capital repayment basis. 
The mortgage terms and conditions allow overpayments of up to 10% of the outstanding 
balance to be made in any 12-month period from 1 January to 31 December.  
In September 2021 Miss OR and Miss JR asked Accord how much overpayment they could 
make before 31 December 2021 and 28 February 2022. Accord replied to say that the 
overpayment limit in September 2021 was £10,076.65 at that point, that this would be 
reviewed on 1 January 2022 and would thereafter be 10% of the balance on that date.
Miss OR and Miss JRs mortgage interest rate product was due to expire on 28 February 
2022 and in December 2021 they arranged a new interest rate product. I note this was done 
through their own independent financial adviser. 
In December 2021, before arranging the new product, they asked Accord: Our fixed term 
ends in February and we want a new 2 year fixed mortgage, but for a reduced amount. Can 
we make a one of payment on renewal without affecting our ability to make 10% payments 
annually, penalty free? (sic)
Accord replied: If you delay the start of the new product by a few days (you need to 
arrange this when applying for the product) you will be able to make a more substantial 
overpayment while you are on Standard Variable Rate [SVR]. Then when the new product 
commences, you will have a further allowance to the end of the year, renewing again on 
1 January. (my emphasis added above)
The product transfer offer dated 13 December 2021 states:  From completion of your 
mortgage product until the following 31 December you may repay up to 10% of the amount 
originally borrowed or transferred. In each subsequent 12 month period from 1 January to 31 
December you may repay up to 10% of the outstanding balance as of the 1 January. 
Overpayments which exceed these restrictions will incur an [ERC]. 
(I will clarify here that, in the case of an interest rate product transfer the amount originally 
borrowed or transferred means the amount that is transferred onto the new interest rate 
product, rather than the amount of the original mortgage borrowing at inception of the loan.)
On the acceptance form for the new product signed by Miss OR and Miss JR on 
24 December 2021 they ticked the box to say that, in order to avoid any ERC on their 
existing product, they wanted the product switch to take place after 28 February 2022. It was 
therefore set to start on 1 March 2022 and this was confirmed by Accord in a letter dated 
10 January 2022.
Despite Accord explaining that, in order to make an overpayment on SVR it would be 
necessary to delay the start of the new product at the time of applying for it, it appears that 
Miss OR and Miss JRs mortgage adviser didnt request any such deferment at the time of 
the application. As a result, the new mortgage interest rate product ran on immediately from 
expiry of the previous product. This meant that, from 1 March 2022 to 31 December 2022 
there would be a new 10% allowance, which would be re-set on 1 January 2023 for a further 
12 months.
On 28 February 2022, at 17:03pm, Miss OR and Miss JR called Accord and said they 
wanted to make an overpayment. They originally wanted to pay £10,000 but, after being told 
that the annual allowance was £21,697.75, a payment of £21,650 was made, in the hope 
that it would arrive in time to avoid going against the overpayment allowance on the new 
product. 
The payment wasnt received until 1 March 2022, and so it was taken off the annual 
overpayment allowance that began to run from that day  the date the new product started. 
After a complaint was raised, Accord agreed to defer the start of the new product until 
2 March 2022 so that the overpayment was applied to the account without incurring an ERC.
In its final response letter Accord confirmed that the account had been put back in the 
position it would have been if the 10% overpayment had been received before the product 
moved onto the new interest rate product on 1 March 2022. Accord paid compensation of 
£100 for any inconvenience caused.
However, Miss OR and Miss JR werent happy about this. They said theyd actually intended 
to pay £30,000 between the end of the old interest rate product and the start of the new one 
and wanted Accord to allow them to pay the remaining amount of about £9,000 without any 
ERC.
Accord wouldnt agree to this and so the complaint was brought to our service. An 
investigator looked at what had happened and thought the complaint should be upheld. He 
asked Accord to allow Miss OR and Miss JR to make a further payment up to £30,000 
without incurring any ERC.
Miss OR and Miss JR accepted this, although they wanted further compensation. Accord, 
however, didnt agree. Accord explained that when Miss OR and Miss JR called to make an 
overpayment on 28 February 2022, it was too late to defer the start of the new product. So 
the limit of the overpayment was 10% of the outstanding balance as at 1 January 2022.
Provisional decision of 16 May 2023
I issued a provisional decision in which I made the following findings:
Im satisfied that Accord made it clear that if Miss OR and Miss JR wanted to make 
an overpayment in excess of the annual 10% allowance, they would need to defer the start of their new mortgage product  and that this would have to be requested at 
the time of the application. I can see that the product transfer was applied for through 
Miss OR and Miss JRs own independent financial adviser (IFA). 
I dont know whether the IFA was instructed to ask for a deferment of the start of the 
new interest rate product until after 1 March 2022 (so that the product could be on 
SVR for long enough to allow an overpayment in excess of the 10% annual 
allowance to be made). This complaint is solely about whether Accord, not the IFA, 
did anything wrong.
But in any event, no deferral for the new product onto SVR for a few days was 
requested by the IFA, and so the new product which Miss OR and Miss JRs IFA 
applied for was set to begin on 1 March 2022, immediately on expiry of the old 
product. Im satisfied Accord confirmed this in writing, on 10 January 2022. Given 
this, it follows that I am also satisfied that there was no ambiguity about when the 
new product would begin  which was the day after the old product expired. 
This meant there was no period when the mortgage was on SVR  which would have 
allowed a repayment in excess of the annual 10% allowance without any ERC. If this 
was not what Miss OR and Miss JR had wanted, or if it was contrary to their 
instructions to their IFA, they will need to speak to their IFA about this; Accord isnt 
responsible for the arrangement of the new product, only for its execution.
Therefore, before the new product began, Miss OR and Miss JR had the annual 10% 
allowance available to them which began on 1 January 2022 up until 28 February 
2022. Once the new product began on 1 March 2022, they had a new 10% 
allowance, which ran until 31 December 2022, and which would be re-set on 1 
January 2023 for the following year until 31 December 2023.
In the circumstances, Im satisfied that Accord correctly advised 
Miss OR and Miss JR when they called on 28 February 2022 that they could make a 
maximum payment of 10% of their outstanding balance as at 1 January 2023 (less 
any overpayments they might already have made at that date) without incurring an 
ERC. 
Im not persuaded by the available evidence that Miss OR and Miss JR told Accord 
they wanted to pay £30,000 on 28 February 2023; in fact, if they had done so, Accord 
would have been entitled to charge an ERC on any amount paid in excess of the 
10% allowance. 
Thats because, as I said above, no deferral of the new product had been requested 
at the time it was applied for, and so there was no point at which the mortgage had 
reverted to SVR between expiry of the old product and the start of the new. And, I 
reiterate, it was up to Miss OR and Miss JRs IFA to have requested a deferral, at the 
time the application was made in December 2021.
Miss OR and Miss JR left it very late in the day to make the overpayment on 28 
February 2022. Its not surprising that this wasnt credited to the account until the 
following day. If it had been received in time, it would have been applied to the 
account on 28 February 2022 as the 10% overpayment allowed for the period 1 
January 2022 to 28 February 2022; it wouldnt have counted towards the new 10% 
allowance which kicked in on 1 March 2022 when the new interest rate product 
began. Im glad to note that Accord agreed to put this right, and deferred the new interest 
rate product until 2 March 2022 so the overpayment wouldnt count towards the new 
10% annual allowance that started with the new interest rate product on 1 March 
2022. Accord also paid £100 compensation, which I think is fair.
But I dont think theres any basis on which it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
order Accord to allow a further payment to be made without any ERC to round up the 
payment to £30,000, backdated to 28 February 2022. Thats because, as Ive said 
above, there was no request at the time of the application to defer the start date of 
the new product, and so if any payment had been made in excess of the 10% annual 
allowance on 28 February 2022, Accord would, quite rightly, have been entitled to 
charge an ERC on this.
In all the circumstances, therefore, I dont think Accord has done anything wrong.
Responses to the provisional decision
Accord had nothing further to add. 
Miss OR and Miss JR replied to say (and I summarise) that theyd been told by Accord that 
in order to make a lump sum payment without an ERC they would need to defer the new 
product by a few days. 
They say that Accords response told them quite clearly what to do, i.e. phone and have a 
day or two variable rate, delaying the new fixed rate mortgage until the payment had been 
cleared..
Theyve provided a copy of a secure message which Miss OR and Miss JR say supports 
this.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reviewed the file from the outset, and considered what Miss OR and Miss JR have said 
in response to the provisional decision. Having done so, Im not persuaded to change the 
outcome I reached in my provisional decision.
Ive already seen the secure message from Accord which Miss OR and Miss JR referred to 
in their response to the provisional decision; it was sent by Accord as part of the case file. It 
needs to be taken in context with the other messages, including the instruction that the 
deferral had to be requested at the time of the application. 
The chain is as follows (redacted to remove identifying details):

Our fixed term ends in February and we want a new 2 year fixed mortgage, but for a

ability to make 10% payments annually, penalty free? (sic)Accord to Miss OR and Miss JR Created Date: 10-DEC-2021 Time: 13:26:24
Thank you for your message.
If you delay the start of the new product by a few days (you need to arrange this 
when applying do the product) you will be able to make a more substantial 
overpayment while you are on Standard Variable Rate. Then when the new product 
commences you will have a further allowance to the end of the year, renewing again 
on 01 January.
I hope that is of help  come back to us if you have any further queries!
Miss OR and Miss JR to Accord Created Date: 21-DEC-2021 Time: 19:40:02
Thanks this is helpful, but raises a couple more thoughts. I believe that the 10% we 
are allowed to repay penalty free each calendar year is 10% of the original loan 
amount, approx.£30,000 per calendar year. Is this correct? If so, and we opt for the 
variable rate for a few days to facilitate additional repayment penalty free, would we 
still be able to subsequently repay 10% of the original loan amount every calendar 
year, or would we then only be able to repay 10% of the reduced balance, possibly 
£190,000, after repayments?
Accord to Miss OR and Miss JR Created Date: 22-DEC-2021 Time: 11:52:14
Thank you for your message.
No, the 10% allowance is based on the outstanding amount on the mortgage on 01 
January each year, so the overpayment allowance from 01 January to 28 February 
2022 (when the current product ends) will be in the region of 21,800 - 21,900.00 
(calculated on today's balance). You still have 700.61 of the 2021 allowance 
remaining if you wish to make use of that up to 31 December.
If you take out a new mortgage product to begin on 01 March 2022, you will get a 
further overpayment allowance running from that date to 31 December 2022.
I hope this clarifies the position.
Miss OR and Miss JR to Accord Created Date: 20-JAN-2022 Time: 10:58:42
Hi,
Our current fixed term ends on 28th February and we have a new fixed term 
mortgage approved. We want to pay off some of the outstanding amount without it 
contributing to the 10% we are allowed to pay off penalty free, annually. What is the 
most effective way to do this?
Accord to Miss OR and Miss JR Created Date: 20-JAN-2022 Time: 16:12:16
Thank you for your message.
To make this overpayment, you will need to delay the start of the new product for a 
few days at the beginning of March and make the extra overpayment while you lapse temporarily onto Standard Variable Rate. Then, when the new product is applied you 
will still have your overpayment allowance for the rest of the year, renewing in 
January 2023.
To arrange this, please call the Direct Mortgage Team on [Redacted] - they are 
available from 9am to 5pm (9am to 1pm on Saturday).
Miss OR and Miss JR didnt contact the Direct Mortgage Team in January 2022. 
As noted in the provisional decision, Miss OR and Miss JRs mortgage broker hadnt applied 
for any deferral of the start of the new product. Accord had been quite clear about what 
needed to be done, and Im satisfied there was no ambiguity in what Miss OR and Miss JR 
had been told. It was up to them to instruct their mortgage broker to apply for the deferral so 
they could make the overpayment before the new product began.
I think its possible that, if Miss OR and Miss JR had contacted Accord within a short time 
after receiving the message dated 20 January 2022 sent at 16:26:16 it might have been 
possible for Accord to delay the start of the new product. Instead, Miss OR and Miss JR 
waited until after 5pm on the day their old mortgage product expired to request a deferral, 
despite already having arranged for their new product to start on 1 March 2022. This was far 
too late for Accord to make any changes to the new mortgage product.
As a goodwill gesture, Accord allowed a 10% overpayment to be made on 1 March 2022 
without applying an ERC, and manually deferred the start date of the new product to the 
following day. As Accord wasnt under any obligation to do this, I think it acted very 
reasonably in allowing an overpayment to be made when it was not in any way at fault.
Im satisfied there has been no error by Accord. As I said in the provisional decision, if 
Miss OR and Miss JR instructed their broker to apply for a deferral and the broker didnt do 
so, theyll need to take this up with the broker. 
Because no deferral of the start date of the new product was requested at the point of 
application, and because Miss OR and Miss JR didnt contact Accord until it was too late to 
change the mortgage product, Im unable to find Accord to be at fault.
Miss OR and Miss JR have said they didnt receive the £100 compensation offered by 
Accord. I see this was rejected by Miss OR and Miss JR, which is why it wasnt paid. 
Because Im not upholding the complaint, I simply leave it up to Miss OR and Miss JR to 
decide if they want to accept the £100 compensation in full and final settlement of the matter, 
in which case they should contact Accord direct for payment.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
This final decision concludes the Financial Ombudsman Services review of this complaint. 
This means that we are unable to consider the complaint any further, nor enter into any 
correspondence about the merits of it.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R and Miss R 
to accept or reject my decision before 28 June 2023.
