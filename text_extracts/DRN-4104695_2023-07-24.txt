The complaint
R, a limited company, complains about the way that National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) handled its accounts.
R wants NatWest to refund fees and interest and pay compensation. 
Mr R, a director of R, brings this complaint on Rs behalf. 
What happened
R runs a farming business and had a loan with NatWest. In early 2022, the loan was due to 
be repaid. Mr R is unhappy that NatWest didnt contact him sooner to discuss the loan so 
that it could be refinanced or converted into an overdraft facility as discussed previously. 
Mr R was very unhappy with the way Rs relationship manager (RM) conducted himself. Mr 
R found him difficult to contact, rude and unhelpful. 
Mr R says that because of the delay in refinancing the loan, he withdrew money from a third 
party earlier than intended which led to additional costs for R. 
Mr R says he and his family found the whole situation very upsetting, particularly after having 
been a loyal customer of NatWest for several decades.
In late May 2022, NatWest apologised to Mr R for the standard of service hed received. 
NatWest said that it had provided feedback to the RM concerned but didnt think he was 
wrong not to approve Rs refinance application without the financial information requested. 
NatWest said that Rs new RM would be in touch about the refinancing and Mr Rs offer to 
repay the loan with money in Rs account. NatWest sent Mr R a hamper to apologise for any 
distress and inconvenience. 
In September 2022, NatWest agreed an overdraft facility for £150,000 until June 2023, with 
the loan account to be repaid once the facility had been applied.
Mr R is unhappy that the overdraft facility was for 9 months rather than a year. He also 
thought that NatWests fee was higher than it should have been. NatWest says that the fee 
for a 9 month facility is the same as for a 12 month facility. But as a gesture of goodwill, it 
refunded part of the fee to R. 
The investigator didnt recommend that Mr Rs complaint be upheld. She said that as calls 
with the RM were made using his mobile, there are no call recordings. Without these, the 
investigator couldnt know exactly what happened although she could see there had been a 
breakdown of the relationship between Mr R and the RM.
The investigator told Mr R that as the complainant is limited company R, she couldnt award 
compensation for any distress and upset that Mr R felt personally. The investigator thought 
NatWests gift to Mr R was a reasonable way to apologise for any failure in service when the 
new RM didnt provide his details as part of the handover process. 
The investigator didnt think NatWest made a mistake when it declined Rs lending 
application in May 2022. She thought it was Mr Rs responsibility to keep on top of the 
repayment deadline for the loan. 
The investigator didnt think it was reasonable to ask NatWest to cover any additional costs 
incurred when Mr R withdrew money early from the third party. 
The investigator didnt agree that Rs previous RM guaranteed the loan would be rolled over 
into an overdraft. She noted that R had now been successful in its application for an 
overdraft. The investigator thought NatWest made it clear the facility would end in June 
2023. The investigator explained that the overdraft arrangement fee is the same for a 9 
month facility as a 12 month facility. The investigator noted that NatWest refunded part of the 
fees which she thought was more than reasonable.
The investigator thought it was Rs choice to engage the services of an accountant so 
wouldnt ask NatWest to cover the costs. 
Mr R is unhappy with the investigation outcome. He says the investigator hasnt placed 
enough weight on his attempts to contact the RM ahead of the expiry of the loan. Mr R says 
that previous relationship managers have always contacted him with enough time to discuss 
future arrangements. 
Mr R says NatWest didnt promise that Rs loan could be converted into an overdraft. His 
point is that NatWest didnt leave enough time to have the discussion before the loan was 
due to expire. Mr R provided an email from 2019 which shows his previous relationship 
manager contacted him a few weeks ahead of time. 
Mr R says that he attempted to contact Rs RM in April 2022 without success. Mr R says that 
if NatWest had done everything in a timely fashion, there would not have been a problem 
and R would not have incurred interest charges due to withdrawing funds from a third party. 
Mr R thinks that as NatWest is at fault, a penalty should be applied. 
Mr R thinks the investigator has ignored the human element and the distress felt by 
individuals in R. Mr R wonders whether banks can abuse company directors without any 
penalty. Mr R asks why the RM concerned is referred to as an individual although they are 
part of NatWest when Mr R has been denied this right.
As Mr R on behalf of R is unhappy with the investigation outcome, the complaint has come 
to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im grateful to Mr R for his clarification of Rs complaint. Although I may not comment on 
each and every point hes raised, this doesnt mean I have not read and considered 
everything hes provided. Instead I have focussed on what I consider to be the key points. 
This is not intended as a discourtesy  it simply reflects the informal nature of this service. 
I should also explain that this service doesnt supervise, regulate, or discipline the 
businesses that we cover. My role is not to punish or fine business for the way in which they 
conduct their business  thats the role of the regulator  the Financial Conduct Authority.
Im sorry to hear about the distress Mr R and his wife have felt but as the investigator explained, R is a limited company and so its own legal entity. This means I cant consider the 
upset Mr R or his wife have felt personally. I can only consider whether NatWest acted fairly 
and reasonably towards R.
It is clear from reading the file that Mr R and Rs RM had a difference of opinion about the 
refinancing of Rs loan. The RM says he asked Mr R for information about his personal 
finances and cash flow projections which he was unwilling to share. As a responsible lender, 
NatWest wanted to make sure R wasnt taking on debt that it couldnt afford. Particularly as 
the most recent available accounts showed a substantial decrease in turnover between 2019 
and 2020 and a significant increase in operating loss. I dont think it was unreasonable of 
NatWest to request further information, even if it had previously agreed lending without 
requesting the same level of financial detail. Without the additional financial information, I 
dont think it was unreasonable of NatWest to say that it couldnt refinance Rs loan in May 
2022. 
Mr R has commented that he doesnt understand how the RM managed to assess Rs 
business within a matter of days before rejecting its application. The RM has said that he 
involved other colleagues to help with the process and turned it around quickly given the 
approaching repayment date. This seems reasonable and I dont think the speed of 
turnaround is an indication that NatWest didnt do a thorough job, particularly as Mr R hadnt 
provided the more detailed financial information which NatWest had requested. 
Although Mr R says there wouldnt have been any problems if NatWest had contacted him 
sooner than it did, I dont know that this would have been the case given Mr Rs reluctance 
to provide further financial information. In any event, Mr R was able to have conversations 
with NatWest before Rs loan expired. So, I cant reasonably find that NatWest failed to 
review the situation before the loan was due to be repaid. I should also say that NatWest 
doesnt have a record of Mr R making contact about the loan earlier than the end of April 
2022. At this time, the RM was away and got in touch with Mr R on his return. So, Im not 
persuaded there was an unreasonable delay on the part of NatWest.
As R didnt meet the refinancing criteria in May 2022, I dont consider it unreasonable for 
NatWest to ask for the loan to be repaid. I appreciate that R withdrew money from a third 
party to allow it to repay the lending and that this incurred additional costs. This was Rs 
choice to make, so I dont require NatWest to compensate R for the interest or costs applied 
by the third party. 
I also note that R had the benefit of the £100,000 that it withdrew in May 2022 until the loan 
was repaid in October 2022 so R could have used or invested the money elsewhere pending 
the outcome of the refinancing process. This would have minimised any loss to R caused by 
withdrawing the cash early. 
I can understand Mr Rs upset and concern but as Ive said, the complainant here is R, not 
Mr R or his wife. Overall, Im satisfied that NatWest has done enough to put things right for 
R. I dont require NatWest to do anything further. Im sorry that this is likely to disappoint Mr 
R.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask R to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 August 2023.
