K820x#14complaint
Mr W says Canada Square  Operations  Limited  (Canada Square) mis-sold him a regular 
premium payment protection insurance (PPI) policy to cover his credit card repayments.
background
Mr W applied  for a credit card over the internet in 2000. At the same time he took out a PPI 
policy to cover his credit  card repayments.  The policy cost £0.59 per £100 of the balance on 
Mr Ws credit card.  A successful claim on the policy wouldve paid 10% of the outstanding 
balance for up to 12 months  per claim if Mr W was unable to work  due to accident or 
sickness or lost his job.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Mr Ws complaint should be upheld  because he thought  Mr W 
made it clear  in his application he wanted  PPI and thought it wouldve provided  a useful 
benefit.
Mr W disagrees. He says he didnt need the policy and thought it was compulsory. 
So the complaint has come  to me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  the sale of PPI on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding 
Mr Ws complaint.
Having done so Im in agreement with our adjudicator  and Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Ws 
complaint. 
The PPI was applied  for online when Mr W applied for a credit card. Canada Square  have  
given us a copy  of the screen shots  of the application form Mr W wouldve seen and 
completed when  he applied for his credit card. 
I can see that theres a separate  section  on the application form that deals with PPI. Within 
this section it briefly explains what the cost of PPI is along with what  it protects against and 
gives the customer the option to either  select:
Yes, I would like to protect my repayments; or 
No, I do not wish to protect my repayment 
Canada Square  say Mr W wouldnt have  been  able to continue with the application without 
selecting one of these options.  I think because Mr W had PPI its likely he selected to take 
PPI. If Mr W didnt want to take out PPI he couldve selected not to take the cover.  So I 
think its likely Mr W understood he had a choice in taking out the PPI and chose  to take it 
because he wanted  the cover. 
Because the PPI was taken out over the internet I dont  think  Canada Square  advised Mr W 
to take PPI. What  this means is that Canada Square  didnt recommend PPI to Mr W, they 
just gave him information about PPI. This information needed to be given in a way that was 
clear, fair and not misleading so he could  make an informed choice about buying PPI.
Ref: DRN92628742I can see the cost of the policy  is shown on the application form. But I cant  say whether all 
the proper information needed  was given. That being said even if Canada  Square did give all 
the information Mr W needed to make  an informed choice on taking  out the policy,  I think he 
wouldve still taken the policy  because at the time of sale:
He was eligible for the PPI.
It doesnt look like he wouldve been caught  by any of the main  exclusions in the terms 
and conditions  of the policy which couldve made it difficult  to make a successful claim.
At the time of the sale Mr W says he was entitled to sick pay and his family wouldve 
helped make  his repayments if he was unable  to work  or lost his job. But the policy  
wouldve paid out on top of this and for potentially longer covering his payments for up 
to 12 months if he was too sick to work or lost his job. So I cant  see how knowing this 
information wouldve  put him off buying  it.
Theres nothing to suggest the policy wasnt affordable to Mr W and he could cancel the 
policy if he no longer  wanted it.
So I dont  think it wouldve made a difference in how the information was given to Mr W on 
the PPI. I think he wouldve still taken out the PPI policy  as it was of value to him.
Which means Canada Square doesnt have to pay back all of the cost of the PPI to Mr W.
But Canada Square has paid back some of the cost of the PPI to Mr W because: 
When the policy was sold,  Canada Square  expected to get a high level of 
commission and profit share (more  than 50% of the PPI premium) - so it should  have  
told Mr W about that. Because Canada Square didnt tell Mr W, that was unfair. 
To put that right, Canada Square has paid back the amount of commission and profit 
share that was above 50% of the PPI premium - and I think  that is fair in this case.
my final decision
The PPI policy one wasnt mis-sold  so Canada Square Operations Limited does  not have 
to pay back all of the cost of the PPI to Mr W.
Ref: DRN92628743But Canada Square Operations  Limited  does have  to pay back to Mr W any commission  and 
profit share it got that was more than 50% of the PPI premium.  I understand it has already 
done this, so I dont  award any further compensation. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr W to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 September 2019.
