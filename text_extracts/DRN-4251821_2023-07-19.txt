DRN-4251821
The complaint
Miss S is unhappy that NewDay Ltd havent provided her with the correct type of credit card.
What happened
Miss S is severely disabled and is prescribed medication which affects her memory.
Because of this, a chip and pin credit card isnt suitable for Miss S, because she struggles to
remember PIN numbers.
In October 2022, NewDay sent Miss S a chip and pin credit card. Miss S contacted NewDay
and explained why she needed a chip and signature card rather than a chip and pin card.
Following this, NewDay sent a replacement credit card to Miss S, but that was again a chip
and pin card. Miss S wasnt happy about this, so she raised a complaint.
NewDay upheld Miss Ss complaint and apologised for the service shed received. NewDay
also made a payment of £100 to Miss D as compensation for any trouble and upset she may
have experienced as a result. However, NewDay didnt issue a new chip and signature card
to Miss S as she was seeking. Miss S wasnt satisfied with how NewDay had resolved her
complaint, so she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint and didnt feel that NewDay had resolved
matters fairly. So, they recommended that NewDay issue a new chip and signature card to
Miss S and increase the total amount of compensation payable to Miss S to £300. NewDay
didnt agree with the view of this complaint put forwards by our investigator, so the matter
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 4 July 2023 as follows:
In their correspondence with this service, NewDay have explained that Miss S wasnt 
sent a replacement chip and pin card by mistake  as it was stated in their complaint 
response letter had been the case  but that the replacement card issued to Miss S 
was of the correct chip and signature type. As such, NewDay have confirmed that 
they didnt send a further new credit card to Miss S after the complaint response 
letter had been sent to Miss S.
But NewDays complaint response letter clearly states that NewDay did incorrectly 
send a replacement chip and pin card to Miss S. And NewDay dont appear to have 
ever updated Miss S as to their position that the correct type of card is already in her 
possession until making this service aware of this point, which they did approximately 
six months after they issued their complaint response to Miss S.
During this time, Miss S has understandably had no confidence in the card in her 
possession and has explained how shes been fearful of using the card for being 
asked to input a PIN, which she wouldnt be able to remember and which she would 
find embarrassing. And as a result, Miss S has relied largely on the assistance of her 
son when wanting to make payments, which Im in agreement with Miss S shouldnt 
fairly or reasonably be the case and which I can understand would be, from Miss Ss 
perspective, neither pleasant nor ideal.
As such, while I can appreciate that NewDay may have felt that that Miss S already 
had the correct type of credit card in her possession, I cant see that NewDay have 
ever clearly explained this to Miss S or provided her with clear and explicit 
instructions on how to use that card. And, given the content of NewDays complaint 
response letter, Im satisfied that it was reasonable for Miss S to be of the 
understanding that the card in her possession was a chip and pin card.
Indeed, Miss S is still of the opinion that the card is a chip and pin card, despite 
NewDays opinion on the matter being relayed to her. And this is because Miss S has 
explained that the only time that she tried to use the card after receiving it, she was 
asked to input a PIN.
As such, its understandable to me why Miss S wouldnt have any confidence in the 
card in her possession, and I feel that Miss S is incurring an ongoing detriment by not 
being able to use the card as she would like. And I feel that the impact of this 
detriment is unfortunately exacerbated in this instance because of Miss Ss disability 
and the understandable anxieties that surround it regarding this matter, as Miss S 
has described them.
Conversely, given Miss Ss understandable lack of confidence in the card and the 
impact of this matter on her because of her disability, I struggle to understand why 
NewDay have refused to issue a new replacement card to Miss S up to this point. 
This is especially the case given that Miss S reasonably expected a replacement 
card following the complaint response letter she received and given that our 
investigator has asked NewDay to issue a replacement card to Miss S on several 
occasions during the process of their investigation.
Ultimately, I feel that had NewDay issued a new credit card to Miss S when they first
indicated that they would  or at the very least, provide a clear explanation to Miss S 
that the card in her possession was a chip and signature card along with clear 
instructions on how to use that card  that much of the ongoing detriment that Im 
satisfied that Miss S has suffered here could have been avoided. And it follows from 
this that my provisional decision here will be that I uphold this complaint in Miss Ss 
favour and that NewDay must issue a replacement chip and signature card to Miss S, 
along with clear instructions on how to use it.
Additionally, because of the significant impact I feel NewDays failings have had on 
Miss S here as a vulnerable customer, as Ive described them above, my provisional 
instructions also include that NewDay must make a payment of a further £500 to 
Miss S  in addition to any compensation that theyve already paid  as recompense 
for the upset, worry, and inconvenience this ongoing matter has caused her.
Finally, Miss S feels that NewDay have failed in their duty to make reasonable 
adjustments for them under the Equality Act 2010. Ive taken the Equality Act 2010 
into account when deciding this complaint  given that its the relevant law  but Ive 
ultimately decided this complaint on what I feel is fair and reasonable. If Miss S wants a decision that NewDay has breached the Equality Act 2010, then she would need to 
go to Court.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Miss S and NewDay the opportunity to provide 
any comments or new information they might wish me to consider before I moved to issue a 
final decision. Miss S confirmed that she was happy to accept my provisional decision, 
whereas NewDay did not respond. 
As such, I see no reason not to issue a final decision upholding this complaint in Miss Ss 
favour on the basis explained in my provisional decision. And I therefore confirm that I do 
uphold this complaint on that basis accordingly.
Putting things right
NewDay must issue a replacement chip and signature card to Miss S, along with clear 
instructions on how to use it.
NewDay must also pay a further £500 to Miss S  in addition to any compensation theyve 
already paid.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 August 2023.
