K821x#15complaint
Mr O has complained about short-term loans granted to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid. Mr O says he couldnt  afford  these loans and that QuickQuid didnt 
take appropriate steps to check whether he could afford them when he took them out. 
background
QuickQuid agreed 11 short-term loans for Mr O between November 2011 and June 2013. 
Each loan was repayable over between one and two months, with the exception  of loan 11.  
Loan 11 was a flexible credit agreement  (flex-credit). This was a credit  facility that allowed 
Mr O to draw  down  money up to a pre-agreed  credit  limit, with a view to repaying it  
potentially over a period  of up to 10 months.
Several of Mr Os loans  were topped up, sometimes on more than one occasion. This is 
where Mr O took out further borrowing under the same agreement,  before paying  back the 
initial amount  borrowed.  Ive set out a summary of the lending below.

QuickQuid objected to this service considering the sale of loan 1, as it said the age of the 
loan meant  it fell outside of our jurisdiction. Mr O agreed to drop his complaint about loan 1, 
so the adjudicator reviewed the remaining loans, loans 2 - 10, including all top-ups and 
re-finances of these loans. And the flex-credit agreement (loan  11).
The adjudicator, having reviewed the case, recommended  the complaint be upheld in part. 
She felt that the checks carried out on loan 2 were proportionate. And she felt that while  the 
checks QuickQuid carried out on loans 3 to 5 werent proportionate, based on the evidence 
provided, she still thought it wouldve been  reasonable  for QuickQuid to have concluded 
these loans were affordable for Mr O at the time they were approved,  if proportionate  checks  
had been carried  out. 
Ref: DRN50106692She did however  think that from loan 6 onwards, it shouldve been  clear to QuickQuid that 
Mr O was no longer using these loans as a temporary fix to a short-term  cash flow problem, 
and they were more  likely being used  to plug a hole in his finances. A hole that grew each 
month with the additional interest  he continued  to repay. She therefore  thought  QuickQuid 
shouldve realised these  loans were not sustainably affordable for Mr O at the time they were 
approved, and that QuickQuid shouldve therefore not agreed to them. 
QuickQuid accepted the adjudicators findings regarding  loans  6  10, and has already 
agreed to refund the interest and charges Mr O paid on these loans. But it disagreed with the 
findings regarding  the flex credit  agreement.
Mr O raised no new arguments in response to the adjudicators findings.
So as an agreement has not been  reached  at this stage, the case has come to me, as an 
ombudsman, for a final decision. And as the only loan that now remains in dispute is loan 11 
 the flex credit, my decision will focus  on this loan only.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
QuickQuid initially said that at the time Mr O took out his flex-credit  agreement, it carried out 
an assessment of affordability which integrated  a variety of unique  customer  specific  
variables, as well as using information verified by Mr O. It also said it considered  Mr Os 
credit scoring information from credit  reference agencies as well as reviewing other third 
party reports.
 
Our adjudicator, having looked  at everything, felt that the pattern of lending  QuickQuid had 
provided to Mr O up until the point he took out the flex-credit agreement, was enough for it to 
have realised Mr O was no longer  using  this type of credit as a short-term fix to a temporary 
cash flow problem, and it was more likely that he was becoming dependant  on this type of 
credit. She therefore thought QuickQuid should  not have provided this loan,  and should  
refund the interest and charges Mr O had paid. QuickQuid however, disagreed  with these 
findings. 
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the FCA guidance in how complaints are to be 
dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] 
which says that businesses procedures for complaint handling should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
Ref: DRN50106693(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr O 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Os income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Os complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr O would be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr O would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Os indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
1. Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks to satisfy  
itself that Mr O would  be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr O would have been  able to do so?
As loans  1 - 10 are no longer in dispute,  I havent  reconsidered the proportionality of the 
checks QuickQuid carried out on these loans as part of my assessment. And I havent 
recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loan 11 either, because I dont 
think that it is necessary  to do so. Ill explain why.
2. Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mr Os indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ref: DRN50106694Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending.  Ive  looked to see if there  was a point at which 
QuickQuid should  reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Os case,  I think  that this point 
was reached around the time Mr O applied for loan 6. I say this because:
Mr O wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid at this point. 
And was in effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an 
extended period
the amount  Mr O was borrowing had steadily been increasing, and QuickQuid ought 
to have realised it was likely his indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably 
I think that Mr O lost out because QuickQuid  continued to provide borrowing  from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Os indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Os 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im upholding  Mr Os complaint about  loan 11 (flex-credit) because the overall pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr O in some 
other way.  
In summary,  I dont think QuickQuid should have continued to lend from loan 6 onwards, and 
therefore I think it was wrong of it to have approved the flex-credit  facility  provided in 
June 2013.
Ref: DRN50106695what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
I think QuickQuid was wrong to have  approved  loan 11. So in addition to its offer to refund all 
the interest and charges Mr O paid on loans 6  10 including the top-ups and re-finances of 
those loans; it also needs to refund all of the interest and charges Mr O paid towards loan 11,  
the flex-credit agreement.
Specifically, it should:
-refund  all interest and charges Mr O paid on loans 6 to 11, including  all re-finances 
and top-ups on these  loans;
-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple  from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*;
-remove any negative information  about loans 6 to 11 from Mr Os credit file;
-the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 11 should be removed from 
Mr Os credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Mr Os complaint in part. 
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 July 2019 .
