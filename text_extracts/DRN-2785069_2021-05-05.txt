The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) reduced his credit card limit 
and arent willing to reinstate the original limit without a new assessment and a credit search.
What happened
Mr S received communication from a credit reference agency telling him that his available 
credit had reduced. When he investigated this further, he discovered that the credit limit on 
his NatWest credit card had been reduced from £9,500 to £2,000. 
Mr S couldnt remember receiving anything from NatWest informing him of the change, so he 
checked his email account. He found an email that NatWest had sent to him in July 2020. 
This told him about the planned limit reduction. But he hadnt seen this email when it was 
first sent because it was in his email spam folder.
NatWests email said that if Mr S wanted to retain his existing card limit, he should contact 
them. But because hed not seen NatWests email when it was received, the date by which 
he needed to reply to them had passed.
Mr S contacted NatWest as he wanted the original limit reinstating. NatWest agreed to 
increase his card limit up to £4,000. They also told him that if he wanted a higher limit, then 
theyd need to complete a full review of his circumstances. They couldnt guarantee that a 
£9,500 limit would be agreed again.
Mr S complained to NatWest. He said that they hadnt done enough to make sure that he 
was aware that his limit was being reduced. He also thought that NatWest should reinstate 
his original limit without completing further checks. He didnt want them to complete further 
hard credit searches.
NatWest replied to Mr S. They didnt think that theyd done anything wrong here. They made 
suggestions about how they might consider increasing his limit, but Mr S wasnt happy with 
the options they gave. NatWest did apologise for the service Mr S received while 
investigating his complaint. They paid compensation of £50 to reflect this. 
Mr S wasnt happy with NatWests reply, so he decided to refer his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked into the circumstances of Mr Ss complaint. He didnt think 
that NatWest needed to do anything more here. So, Mr S asked that his complaint be 
referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I do understand that Mr S was upset and disappointed that NatWest reduced his credit limit 
by the amount that they did. Particularly as he wasnt aware of this at the time and, as a 
result, lost the opportunity to respond to them.
Mr S said that his financial circumstances remain unchanged from when he first applied to 
NatWest for his card. So, he believes that NatWest should reinstate the original limit of 
£9,500. I do believe its important to make clear our role in these circumstances. Its not the 
role of this service to direct a business as to what its lending criteria is or should be. In just 
the same way that a customer may choose which business they wish to deal with, so a 
business is entitled to determine if its prepared to lend to any individual and if so, how much.
NatWest have confirmed that they wrote to Mr S by email in July 2020. While I havent seen 
the original email, I have been provided with a template of its wording. Mr S also confirmed 
that he eventually found this email in his email spam box. He confirmed that the response 
date was two weeks after the date of the email. Unfortunately, this period had passed by the 
time he found the email.
Mr S believes that NatWest shouldve taken greater steps to ensure that he was informed. 
He believes that such a change shouldve been advised to him in letter format. I do 
appreciate Mr Ss view here. But I think it is reasonable to conclude that the fact that 
NatWest had his email address suggests that he wouldve been happy to receive 
communications from them in this form. 
It is clearly unfortunate that NatWests email had been diverted to Mr Ss spam email folder, 
but I cant reasonably hold NatWest responsible for this. NatWest wouldnt have been aware. 
In any event, it would be reasonable to think that Mr S might check his spam email folder 
from time to time.
NatWests Terms and conditions state that they may reduce the Credit Limit and Advance 
Limit at any time. Generally, NatWest doesnt have to give notice to their customers about 
decreasingly the credit limit. Ultimately, this is a business decision and not one this service 
would look to overturn. Where NatWest does decide to decrease the credit limit, I would 
expect them to ensure that this doesnt have a negative impact on Mr Ss overall ability to 
manage his finances.
Its my understanding that Mr S hadnt been using the credit limit available to him. So, I think 
its reasonable to conclude that the proposed decrease didnt have any major impact upon 
Mr Ss ability to manage his finances. He wasnt reliant upon it and Mr S said that he wanted 
it in case of emergency. Mr S has spoken with NatWest since, but Im not aware that any 
financial difficulties have been highlighted to NatWest since the limit was reduced. So, I cant 
see that NatWest has done anything wrong here.
Mr S has expressed concern that the reduction in his available credit had a detrimental effect 
upon his credit standing. While I can appreciate Mr Ss point of view here, an individuals 
credit standing is judged on a number of factors, not just the credit limits available to them. 
The manner in which available credit is utilised is just as relevant as this demonstrates the 
ability of an individual to manage their finances within the facilities available to them.
NatWest did acknowledge, in their complaint response to Mr S, that his complaint could have 
been handled better. It seems that Mr S experienced some delays and received conflicting 
information. NatWest apologised for this and paid compensation of £50 to Mr S. I believe this 
was a fair outcome in the circumstances.
NatWest have offered to review Mr Ss credit card limit subject to him providing additional 
information and, if necessary, completing a hard credit search. Theyve given no indication 
or guarantees as to the limit that may potentially be offered as a result of this. This seems to 
be an appropriate response in order to ensure that NatWest fulfils its obligations as a 
responsible lender.
I realise that Mrs S will be disappointed by my decision, but I shant be asking NatWest to do 
any more here.My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 June 2021.
