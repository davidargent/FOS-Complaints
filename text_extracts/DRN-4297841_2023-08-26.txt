The complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA unfairly reduced his credit limit without 
notice.
What happened
Mr S says he cleared his PayPal balance on 21 December 2022 by paying it £641 with a 
view to then buying further items which he needed for his car. He says he tried to make a 
payment on 22 December 2022 but found out his credit limit had been reduced from £800 to 
£200. Mr S says he later received an email from PayPal on 22 December 2022 telling him 
that his credit limit had been reduced. He would like either the limit increased or a refund of 
his payment.
PayPal says its entitled to reduce a credit limit in line with its user agreement. It says it cant 
refund Mr S his payment but will pay him as a gesture of goodwill £200 for his 
inconvenience.
Mr S brought his complaint to us, and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator thought PayPal was entitled to reduce the credit limit and hadnt acted unfairly.
Mr S doesnt accept that view but accepts PayPal is entitled to reduce a credit limit. He 
would like his payment refunded.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint.
There is no real dispute that PayPal is entitled to reduce a credit limit. I appreciate the timing 
of that decision caused Mr S a problem, but I cant see that PayPal could have anticipated 
that and think it was entitled to block the payment on 22 December 2022 as it intended to 
reduce the credit limit that day. I cant fairly order PayPal refund Mr S his payment as Im 
satisfied that Mr S owed PayPal that money and it would be unfair to direct it be refunded in 
those circumstances.
I agree with Mr S that PayPal should tell its customers about a potential credit limit reduction 
but also think that when PayPal made that decision, it would be inappropriate to allow further 
lending even if the notice hadnt be sent. Im satisfied Mr S was told about the credit limit 
reduction on the same day he attempted the payment.
I can see PayPal accepts Mr S was caused inconvenience and has fairly offered him £200 
as a gesture of goodwill. I think that is a fair and reasonable offer and in line with the amount 
and type of awards we would make even if I concluded PayPal ought to have given Mr S 
more notice of the credit limit reduction. I will of course leave it to Mr S if he wishes to accept 
that offer and no doubt, he can tell PayPal if he does.
Overall, Im satisfied that PayPal is entitled to reduce a credit limit and isnt obliged to refund 
customers payments in circumstances where a balance is owed as here.
Putting things right
PayPal has made a goodwill gesture offer of £200 which I will let Mr S decide if he wishes to 
accept it for the reasons I have explained.
My final decision
Mt final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 September 2023.
