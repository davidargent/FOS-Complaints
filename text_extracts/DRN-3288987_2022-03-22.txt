The complaint
Mr H complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Black Horse Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr H under a hire purchase agreement with Black Horse that 
was dated in January 2019. He had some issues with the car, which were dealt with, but he 
complained to Black Horse in January 2020 and it paid for a diagnostic test which identified 
some issues with the lights which were repaired. Mr H says that issues with the car have 
continued and that the car has had further diagnostic tests and repairs, some of which were 
paid for by Black Horse. He complained to Black Horse in August 2021 about an issue with 
the cars headlights and said that he wanted to reject the car, a refund of his deposit and 
some compensation. 
Black Horse arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert in October 2021. 
The inspection report said that the car may have an electrical issue due to continuing issues 
with electrical items which would require further investigation and that corrosion had been 
identified but it wouldnt have been developing at the point of sale and had now become an 
issue during the time and mileage since purchase. Black Horse didnt uphold Mr Hs 
complaint so he complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that 
there was enough evidence to suggest that the headlight issues were present or progressing 
since the point of sale as they occurred more than 18 months after Mr H took possession of 
the car and during that time hed covered 34,719 miles. He didnt think that it would be fair or 
reasonable to ask Black Horse to take any further action in relation to this complaint.
Mr H has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary 
and amongst other things, that: 
Black Horse paid for a head light replacement but ten months later the car needed a 
second replacement headlight;
regardless of mileage, the car isnt reliable, hes had nothing but trouble with it and it 
wasnt worth the money that hes paid for it; 
hes had no enjoyment from the car as he was just waiting for something else to go 
wrong, hes spent plenty of money on repairs and the cars been serviced every 
10,000 miles but hes had sleepless nights worrying about it; and
hes terminated the agreement and returned the car so all he wants is to get his 
deposit of £750 back and hes not looking for any compensation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Black Horse, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr H - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr H was nearly four years old, had been driven for 
48,108 miles and had a price of £12,756;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mr H has described nine issues that hes had with the car and which he says started 
soon after the car was supplied to him but hes not been able to provide documentary 
evidence about all of those issues;
the job cards that hes provided show that a fault with the cars windows was repaired 
in November 2019 and that a fault with the cars headlights was repaired by the 
dealer in August 2020 under the warranty when its mileage was recorded as 82,827 
miles; 
further repairs to the headlights were made under the warranty in November 2020 
and July 2021;
the car was supplied to Mr H in January 2019 with a mileage of 48,018 miles and it 
had passed an MOT test in October 2018 (when its mileage was recorded as 48,018 
miles) with no advisories  so I consider it to be more likely than not that the car was 
roadworthy at that time and that its headlights would have been working;
the car passed MOT tests in October 2019, October 2020 and October 2021 (when 
its mileage was recorded as 104,921 miles) so the car was considered to be 
roadworthy at those times and its headlights would have been working (the car did 
fail an MOT test in October 2021 because a headlight wasnt working but it was 
repaired and the car passed an MOT test later the same day);
Mr H complained to Black Horse about the car in August 2021 and it arranged for the 
car to be inspected by an independent expert  the inspection took place in October 
2021 and the cars mileage was recorded as 104,682 miles  the inspection report 
said that the car may have an electrical issue due to continuing issues with electrical 
items which would require further investigation and the independent expert said that 
corrosion had been identified at the first headlight change but it wouldnt have been 
developing at the point of sale and had now become an issue during the time and 
mileage since purchase;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that there was an issue with 
the cars headlights until August 2020  that was more than a year and a half after 
the car was supplied to Mr H and in that time hed been able to drive more than 
34,719 miles in the car;
there have clearly been some issues with the car and Mr H became increasingly 
frustrated with the car before he voluntarily terminated the agreement and returned 
the car  but when it was inspected in October 2021 its mileage was 104,682 miles  
so hed been able to drive more than 56,000 miles in the car;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr H and I consider that Black Horse has 
responded to Mr Hs complaint fairly and reasonably; and
Mr H has returned the car and voluntarily terminated the agreement so it wouldnt be 
appropriate for me to require Black Horse to pay for the car to be repaired and I find 
that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to 
refund to Mr H the deposit that he paid for the car, to pay him any other 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 19  April 2022.
