The complaint
Mr K complains he was unable to purchase items from an online marketplace using his 
PayPal (Europe) Ltd account. 
Mr K also complains PayPal hasnt taken account of his accessibility and communication 
needs
What happened
Mr K says PayPal didnt allow him to make a purchase from an online marketplace and as a 
result he missed out on a promotion which would have saved him £225 on the purchase. 
Mr K says he was told by his bank the reason he was unable to purchase items from the 
online marketplace was because PayPal hadnt correctly identified him using the relevant 
verification process. And so the transaction couldnt complete. Mr K says he has 
correspondence from his bank which confirms the issue lies with PayPal and not them. 
Mr K was also unhappy about a number of communication and customer service issues. He 
was unhappy about things but was told hed have to raise the matter in writing rather than by 
phone. This upset him because hes dyslexic and prefers phone communication. 
PayPal offered Mr K £150 as a gesture of goodwill to settle his complaint. Mr K rejected the 
offer. PayPal didnt increase it. It said it felt it had treated him fairly, and the declined 
transactions were due to Mr Ks bank, and not anything PayPal had done.  PayPal said the 
user agreement stipulates it wouldnt be liable for direct or indirect lost profits or any special, 
incidental, or consequential damages. PayPal said it had already paid Mr K £250 and this, in 
addition to the £150 offered, was fair and reasonable to resolve the complaint. 
Mr K remained unhappy and so PayPal reconsidered its position. It offered to increase the 
£150 offer by a further £100. Mr K remained dissatisfied and so our investigator looked into 
the complaint. 
Our investigator said he agreed PayPal didnt communicate with Mr K as it said it would. But 
PayPal had provided evidence it has recorded Mr Ks required adjustments on its system 
and also attempted to resolve his concerns by offering compensation. The investigator said 
PayPal had covered the losses Mr K told it he had suffered despite it saying the losses 
werent a result of its error. And so the investigator said this was generous in the 
circumstances. 
Mr K didnt agree and so the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I think what PayPal has already offered to put things right for Mr K is fair and 
reasonable. 
In deciding this complaint Ive carefully considered the submissions that have been made by 
Mr K and PayPal. I have looked at what evidence we have, and the surrounding 
circumstances to help me decide what I think is more likely to, or should, have happened. 
Our process
At the outset I think its useful to reflect on the role of this service. This service isnt intended 
to regulate or punish businesses for its conduct  that is the role of the Financial Conduct 
Authority. Instead this service looks to resolve individual complaints between a consumer 
and a business. Should we decide something has gone wrong we would ask the business to 
put things right by placing the consumer, as far as possible, in the position they would have 
been in if the problem hadnt occurred. 
Declined payments
Mr K said the failed transactions were the result of a PayPal system error. PayPal have said 
the payments were declined by Mr Ks card issuer. Mr K doesnt agree and told our 
investigator he had correspondence from his bank which says the issue is with PayPals call 
verification process.
I can see the investigator asked Mr K to provide him with the correspondence from the bank 
which shows the issue was due to PayPal. However I cant see the letter has been provided 
to this service. I havent seen anything to show PayPal was at fault or declined transactions. 
But as a gesture of goodwill it has offered Mr K £250. 
Communication and accessibility 
Mr K says he has received emails from PayPal when he has told it he should be contacted 
by telephone. PayPal have said it is unable to stop its system from sending out automated 
emails with updates. But it has explained this type of communication can be made 
accessible using screen reader technology. So Mr K would be able to access the messages 
in this way. 
PayPal have accepted Mr K shouldnt have been asked to communicate in writing rather 
than by phone. And so PayPal paid Mr K £250 to reflect the shortcomings in service. I think 
this is fair in the circumstances of the complaint. 
Overall I consider PayPal has done enough here to put things right for Mr K. 
Putting things right
PayPal has offered a total of £500 to settle the complaint, and I think this offer is fair in all the 
circumstances. 
My final decision
If it has not already paid that amount PayPal should do so now or pay Mr K any part of that 
amount which remains outstanding.  Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 July 2022.
