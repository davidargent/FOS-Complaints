Our adjudicator did not recommend upholding Miss Ks complaint. She felt that the checks 
MYJAR did on loans 1-3 and 9-11 were sufficient.  And although she thought MYJAR should 
have done better checks before agreeing loans 4-8, she didnt think  those checks  would 
have shown the loans to be unaffordable.  
Miss K didnt agree, so the complaint came to me for a decision. She also complained that 
MYJAR had attempted to collect  under the continuous payment authority from her account  
and she has now been asked to pay around  double what she originally took out. 
I issued my provisional decision on 27 March 2019  explaining why I was thinking of reaching 
a different conclusion to the adjudicator and upholding Miss Ks complaint in relation to loans 
5-8. I also explained why I was not upholding her complaints loans 1-4 and 9-11, as well as 
her complaints about MYJARs attempt to collect money from her account and about the 
total amount she has now paid towards the final loan.
Miss K accepted  my provisional  decision. MYJAR did not respond  to my provisional 
decision.
Ref: DRN52673282my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
As neither party has provided any further evidence  or arguments  for consideration, I see no 
reason to depart from the conclusions set out in my provisional decision. For completeness,  I 
have set this out below.
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss K 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayment 
amounts and Miss Ks income  and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Miss K. These factors  include:
Miss K having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  due to be repaid be especially high (reflecting that it could  be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Miss K having a large  number of loans and/or having these over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing 
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Miss K comping back for loans  shortly after the previous  borrowing had been  
repaid (also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
MYJAR was required to establish whether  Miss K could sustainably  repay  her loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that if a lender realises, or it ought  
fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments 
sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ks complaint.
Ref: DRN52673283I think the checks MYJAR carried out were proportionate for the first four loans. Miss K was 
in the early stages  of her relationship with MYJAR and the amounts that Miss K needed  to 
repay were relatively modest compared  to her income.
I also think that the checks were proportionate  for loans  9-11.  Miss K had taken a substantial  
break from loans with MYJAR since repaying loan 8. I have noted there were some  declined 
applications in this period.  But, in my view the gap, from the last declined  application  to when 
loan 9 was agreed, was enough  for MYJAR  to reasonably consider that Miss Ks financial 
position had recovered. So I think it was reasonable for MYJAR to rely on the income and 
expenses Miss K declared.
loans 5-8
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MYJARs  lending with Miss K in the initial chain of 
loans before there was a substantial breaking lending after loan 8. This is with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR  should reasonably have  seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ks case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 5. I say this because:
From  loan 5 onwards  Miss K was provided with a new loan within  weeks  of settling a 
previous one - even  when she repaid loans early. So MYJAR ought to have realised 
it was more likely than not Miss K was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying her previous  loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Ks 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed MYJAR. 
Loan 8 was taken out 13 months after Miss Ks first loan. And it was for double  the 
amount of the initial loan. Miss K had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect; 
service a debt to MYJAR over an extended period.
I think that Miss K lost out because  MYJAR continued to provide borrowing from 
loan 5 onwards  because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ks indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Ks 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5-8 and MYJAR should put things right as set 
under the putting things right section  below.
Ref: DRN52673284continuous payment  authority
Whilst Miss Ks complaint was with this service, she also complained  that MYJAR attempted 
to take payment under a continuous  payment authority. MYJAR had originally  put the 
repayment of loan on hold for six months whilst the complaint was investigated. But when 
that time frame expired an attempt to take a payment  was made.
As I understand it no payment  or charges were actually taken and this was a one-off 
incident. MYJAR has now put the loan on hold again. I appreciate  Miss K is concerned about 
what might  have happened if a payment had been  taken, but as there  has not been an 
actual financial loss, I dont think an award is appropriate in this case. 
price cap
Miss K also raised concerns that her most recent statement showed  that she has now been 
asked to repay around double what she originally took out. 
From 2 January 2015, the Financial Conduct  Authority introduced a price  cap on high-cost 
short-term credit charges  meaning that the total interest, fees and charges shouldnt be 
capable of coming to more than the amount borrowed. It doesnt seem, from what  Miss K 
has told us, that that is the case.
putting things right  what MYJAR Limited trading as MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss K paid on loans 5-8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
as there  is an outstanding balance then the amounts above can be used to repay any 
balance remaining on the outstanding loan. If this results in a surplus then the 
surplus must be paid to the consumer. However, if an outstanding  balance remains,  
MYJAR should review  the existing repayment  plan that is currently  in place.
the number  of loans taken from 5 to loan 8 means  any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  5-8 should be removed from Miss Ks 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Miss K a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN52673285my final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold  Miss Ks complaint as Ive explained above and in 
my provisional decision. I require MYJAR  Limited trading as MYJAR to put things right for 
Miss K as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 June  2019.
