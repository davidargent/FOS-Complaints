The complaint
Mr J says National Savings and Investments (NS&I) was responsible for a delay in following 
his instructions about his maturing Guaranteed Income Bond (GIB). He says this caused him 
a loss of investment return.
What happened
The chronology of events is broadly agreed between the parties. So too is the fact that NS&I 
was responsible for some delay in Mr J having access to his funds. In summary:
- 30 October 2020 NS&I sent Mr J a letter informing him that his GIB was due to 
mature on 5 December 2020. The value on maturity would be about £376,000. It set 
out his options. It also said if it didnt hear from him by 3 December 2020 it would 
automatically start a new 5-year term GIB, paying a new interest rate of 0.51% gross 
annual equivalent rate.
- 13 November 2020 the trustees of Mr Js Self-invested Personal Pension (SIPP) sent 
switch instructions to NS&I by recorded postal service.
- 18 November 2020 the instructions were received and signed for by NS&I. But they 
werent scanned into its electronic system. It concluded they had possibly been 
misplaced.
- 5 December 2020 Mr Js bond matured and was rolled over into another GIB for the 
same term.
- 9 December 2020 Mr J called NS&I unhappy that his instructions hadnt been carried 
out. He said this had left him financially embarrassed as he wanted to invest the 
funds elsewhere and therefore wanted compensation.
- 18 December 2020 letter from Trustees confirming its instructions were sent 
recorded delivery and hadnt been acted on. Mr Js funds had incorrectly been rolled 
into another GIB.
- 8 January 2021 process started to reinvest full amount of Mr Js GIB funds into a 
standard investment bond (IB).
- 15 January 2021 Mr J chased progress unhappy with length of time it was taking to 
complete the switch. He was advised it could take up to 10 days to complete and was 
assured the money would show in his IB by 22 January 2021.
- 19 January 2021 letter from Trustees stating they have yet to receive funds for Mr Js 
pension.
- 22 January 2021 Mr J chased progress again. NS&I explained it was working through 
a backlog and that his switch should be picked up within the next week. He told it he 
was looking to invest £85,000 of the money elsewhere and so needed these funds 
available.
- 29 January 2021 NS&I incorrectly switched Mr Js funds into another customers 
account causing further delays. This error was identified and the reinvestment was 
cancelled on 12 February 2021.
- 16 February 2021 NS&I executed the reinvestment of £376,000 to Mr Js Income 
Bond. He was advised of such by phone the following day.
- 1 March 2021 NS&I receives cash-in form from Mr J for £85,000 from his IB. 
Payment was processed on 2 March 2021 and was received into his SIPP bank 
account on 5 March 2021.
- Between 6-12 April 2021 Mr Js first tranche of his former GIB funds were placed in a 
broad range of investments.
On 18 March 2021 NS&I responded to Mr Js complaint about what had happened. It upheld 
his case, recognised the things it had got wrong and apologised. It offered him £200 for the 
trouble and upset it had caused him. It also noted his intention had been to invest £85,000 of 
his funds and that the delay it had caused mayve caused him an investment loss. So it 
invited him to provide evidence of the investments he wouldve made.
In his response of 23 March 2021 Mr J said hed wanted to invest all the proceeds of his GIB 
into the UK stock market. Based on the performance of the FTSE All Share Index between 5 
December and 16 February, he calculated his loss as about £16,500.
NS&I couldnt agree with Mr Js proposal. It noted hed only withdrawn £85,000 from his 
former GIB funds, with the balance remaining in his IB. Ultimately it offered to pay him 
redress at 8% simple interest for lost investment opportunity on £85,000 for the 73 days 
delay it took responsibility for between 5 December 2020 and 16 February 2021.
Mr J didnt agree. His position is best summarised in the letter he sent to NS&I on 6 April 
2021:
The pension fund suffered a financial loss during the period from 5 December 2020 to 16 
February 2021 whilst NS&I delayed access to the fundsDuring this period the FTSE All 
Share Index increased by 3.9%.
Furthermore, during the period from 16 February 2021 (when the index was 3840.16) to the 
close of trading on 1 April 2021 (when the index was 3849.24) the FTSE All Share Index 
increased by a further 0.24% having fluctuated due to changing market conditions 
throughout the period (from 3702.40 on 26 February 2021 to 3879.81 on 16 March 2021 
finishing at 3849.24 on 1 April 2021.)
Because of the volatility in the stock market during the period it was decided to keep the 
remaining funds deposited securely with NS&I pending re- investment when markets 
stabilised.
Events arising from 5 December 2020 to 16 February 2021 gave rise to the financial loss of 
£16,449 because of the delay by NS&I in granting access to the funds which were not 
available to invest in a rising stock market. The subsequent withdrawal or lack of withdrawal 
of funds from NS&I has no bearing on this loss because the FTSE All Share Index has not 
fallen below the point at which it was on 16 February 2021.
Mr J brought his complaint to this Service. An Investigator considered the merits of his case 
and upheld it. He initially thought NS&I should pay him redress, based on the methodology it 
had proposed, but also incorporating the second withdrawal.
Mr J questioned why it wasnt fair for him to receive redress based on the investment 
opportunity loss on his full fund. The Investigator said hed made withdrawals of his former 
funds for £85,000 in March 2021; April 2021; June 2021; July 2021 and the remainder in 
September 2021. Despite the delay in moving the funds, he still remained invested in the IB 
for around seven months.The Investigator said if NS&I had correctly invested in the income bond in December 2020, 
it's likely Mr J would still have been invested to some extent in July 2021. And the funds 
were subject to growth while in the income bond. So, he didnt think it would be fair to require 
NS&I to provide redress in the way hed calculated.
NS&I proposed an improved offer of redress based on the Investigators view. It said:
You have indicated Mr J wasnt looking to invest all these funds with the new provider all at 
once, however, its likely he would have made the second investment of £85,000 within the 2 
months (74 day) timeframe that was delayed. There was a 61 day (2 months) difference 
from receiving the first request of £85,000 to receiving the second £85,000 repay request.
[We] would like to offer the difference between 61 -74 days (13 days) = £242.19 and add 
this to the loss of interest we calculated for the first £85,000. So, £242.19 + £1,360 = 
£1,602.19.
Mr J also proposed an alternative methodology for redress in his last substantive submission 
to this Service he said:
NS&I delayed the redemption of the Guaranteed Income Bond of £375,923 from 5 
December 2020 to 16 February 2021. I am seeking redress for this period only.
If you do not believe that I have a valid claim for the investment gains forgone on £375,923 
during the period from 5 December 2020 to 16 February 2021 then perhaps you can agree 
that my pension fund should be compensated for the loss of interest on £375,923 during the 
period from 5 December 2020 to 16 February 2021 at 2.5% which was the rate payable on 
the guaranteed income bond for the 5 years prior to redemption.
This would amount to 2.5% @ £375,923 * 73/365 days = £1879.61 but say £2000 to settle 
the complaint, without further recourse to the Ombudsman.
As both parties couldnt agree with the Investigators view, Mr Js complaint was passed to 
me to review afresh. I issued my provisional decision last month. As neither party submitted 
any new evidence or arguments I see no reason to depart from my initial findings and 
conclusions.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where theres conflicting information about what happened and gaps in what we know, my 
role is to weigh the evidence we do have and to decide, on the balance of probabilities, 
whats most likely to have happened.
Ive not provided a detailed response to all the points raised in this case. Thats deliberate; 
ours is an informal service for resolving disputes between financial businesses and their 
customers. While Ive taken into account all submissions, Ive concentrated my findings on 
what I think is relevant and at the heart of this complaint.
Im upholding Mr Js complaint. I wont dwell any further on the rights and wrongs of this 
case as both parties are in agreement about most of the basic facts, including that NS&I got 
things wrong and should put matters right. The focus now is to achieve a fair settlement and 
closure.
Ive thought about both of Mr Js proposed methods for calculating redress. I think there are 
problems with both.Mr Js first suggestion was that he should receive compensation based on movements in the 
FTSE All Share Index between 5 December 2020 and 16 February 2021. But he hasnt done 
enough to show this was the right fit for his assessed risk appetite at the time. He hasnt 
provided information about the overall fit of his GIB in the context of his other pensions and 
investment position. And he hasnt provided evidence he had firm plans to invest all his GIB 
funds in one instruction, from 5 December 2020.
Rather, the information he did share showed something different. When his funds were 
available they sat for a number of weeks before any action was taken. When he invested his 
GIB funds he did so across a broad range of vehicles. He did so in chunks and over several 
months. Im also mindful that compared with his GIB the FTSE All Shares Index wouldve 
represented a marked up-tick in exposure to risk. And he informed NS&I on one call from 
January 2021 that his intention was to invest a first tranche of £85,000, which is what he 
went on to do in April 2021.
Neither am I persuaded by his argument about why he held his funds in his IB account 
between 17 February 2021and 1 April 2021 because of market volatility. Im wary about the 
unintentional effect here of hindsight. He was an experienced investor and will be aware of 
the mantra its about time in the markets, not timing the markets.
Mr Js more recent proposal was for NS&I to base its redress on the number of days delay 
with interest at 2.5% gross AER, the equivalent rate he received from his GIB prior to 
maturing. Of course, his bond had matured and that rate was no longer available. So, the 
rationale for using this method isnt strong.
In any event, it seems the separate final redress proposals from Mr J (for £1,880) and from 
NS&I (for £1,602) are not so far apart.
Putting things right
National Savings and Investments got things wrong and this had an impact on Mr J. So, he 
should be put back into the position he wouldve been in now, or as close to that as 
reasonably possible, had it not been for its failings.
Based on the information available, Im satisfied that NS&Is latest proposal of compensation 
for Mr J is fair. As was its proposal to pay him an additional £200 for the distress and 
inconvenience it had caused. If it hasnt done so already, it should make arrangements for 
paying any compensation outstanding.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive already set out, Im upholding Mr Js complaint. I now require National 
Savings and Investments to pay compensation to him as Ive indicated.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2023.
