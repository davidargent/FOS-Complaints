K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mr C was given 24 loans  by Sunny  between October 2015 and May 2017. Each of the loans 
was due to be repaid  in six monthly  instalments but Mr C generally repaid the loans within  a 
few weeks of taking  them out. At times  Mr C had up to four loans outstanding at the same 
time. All of Mr Cs loans  have been  fully repaid and a summary of his borrowing from Sunny 
is shown as an appendix to this decision.
Mr Cs complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think Sunny had 
been wrong to give loans  1 to 5 and loans 11 to 15 to Mr C. But he didnt think Sunny  should 
have agreed to lend the remaining loans. So he asked Sunny to pay Mr C some compensation.
Sunny didnt agree with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved 
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mr C accepts  my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr C could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to 
meet a higher repayment  from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become,  or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN14669912I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
Sunny did some checks before it lent to Mr C. It asked him for details of his income, and his 
normal expenditure. And it checked  his credit  file before agreeing  the loans. Ive seen a 
summary of those checks and I dont  think they showed anything  that should  have caused 
additional concerns to Sunny.
As I mentioned earlier each of Mr Cs loans was repayable over a six month  period.  So the 
amounts that Mr C needed to repay  each  time were  smaller than if hed taken  a normal  
payday loan. But of course he was committing to making those repayments over a far longer 
period. And at times  Mr C had a number of loans outstanding together.  So Ive needed to 
consider the total amount  that Mr C needed to repay  to Sunny each month.
I think the fact that Mr C typically repaid his loans much earlier than planned  should  have 
caused some concerns  to Sunny. That might be the sort of behaviour  that would indicate 
that someone was facing  problems managing their money and needing  to refinance loans on 
a regular basis. So Ive also taken that into account  when  looking  at whether Sunny should 
have given the loans to Mr C.
I think that the checks Sunny did before agreeing  the first four loans were proportionate. The 
amounts that Mr C needed to repay  were  small compared with the disposable income  hed 
declared. Given these repayment amounts, what was apparent  about  Mr Cs circumstances 
at the time, and his borrowing history with the lender, I dont think it wouldve  been 
proportionate for Sunny  to ask him for the amount  of information that would be needed to 
show the lending  was unsustainable  before agreeing the first four loans. 
I do think, by the time Mr C asked for loan 5, that Sunny should  have  realised that it couldnt 
safely rely on the information he was providing  about his finances. I think it should have 
taken steps at that time to independently verify Mr Cs true financial position.  We asked Mr C 
for copies  of his bank  statements so we could see what  better checks  would have  shown 
Sunny. He didnt  provide these to us. So Im not able to say that better checks would have  
shown Sunny that it shouldnt have given loan 5 to Mr C.
But looking  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C I think  by loan 6 the 
lender should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise  
harmful. And so Sunny  should have realised  that it shouldnt provide further loans. 
Ref: DRN14669913I say this because:
This was now Mr Cs sixth loan request in just over two months. Each  of the loans 
Mr C had taken  had been repayable over a period  of six months. But Mr C 
regularly paid those  loans off far earlier than planned,  but borrowed similar 
amounts very shortly afterwards. I think that pattern of frequent  borrowing and 
repaying early should have indicated to Sunny that Mr C was most likely  having 
significant problems  managing his money.  
When Mr C asked for loan 6 he wasnt making  any inroads to the amount he owed 
the lender. Loan 6 was followed  two days  later by loan 7. In total they equalled  the 
largest loan hed taken to date. 
Between loan 6 and loan 10 Mr C had multiple  loans  active  at the same time.  So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr C was having to 
borrow further  to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loans was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Cs indebtedness  was increasing  unsustainably.
When Mr C repaid loan 10 there  was then a gap of almost  eight  months before he asked to 
borrow again. I think that gap was long enough to give Sunny some confidence that Mr C 
had overcome whatever  problems  had caused him to borrow  in the past. So I think  Sunny 
was entitled to treat Mr C as a new customer and base its checks accordingly.
So I think that the checks Sunny did before agreeing  the loans 11 to 14 were  proportionate. 
The amounts that Mr C needed to repay  were  small compared with the disposable  income 
hed declared.  Given  these repayment amounts, what  was apparent  about  Mr Cs 
circumstances at the time, and his borrowing history with the lender, I dont think it wouldve 
been proportionate for Sunny to ask him for the amount of information that would be needed 
to show the lending was unsustainable  before  agreeing  the first four loans. 
I do think, by the time Mr C asked for loan 15, that Sunny should have realised once more 
that it couldnt safely rely on the information he was providing about  his finances. I think  it 
should have taken steps at that time to independently verify Mr Cs true financial  position. 
We asked Mr C for copies of his bank  statements  so we could see what  better checks would 
have shown Sunny.  He didnt provide these to us. So Im not able to say that better checks 
would have shown  Sunny that it shouldnt have given loan 15 to Mr C.
But again  looking  at the overall  pattern  of Sunnys lending  history with Mr C I think  by 
loan 16 the lender should reasonably have seen once more that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
provide further  loans.  
I say this because:
This was now Mr Cs sixth loan request in this chain that had been active  for just 
over three  months. Each of the loans Mr C had taken had been repayable over a 
period of six months. But Mr C regularly  paid those loans off far earlier than 
planned, but borrowed similar amounts very shortly afterwards. I think  that pattern 
of frequent borrowing  and repaying  early should have  indicated  to Sunny that Mr C 
was most  likely  having significant problems  managing his money. 
Ref: DRN14669914Although the amounts  Mr C asked to borrow in this second chain were lower  than 
before he was still borrowing regularly. He wasnt making any inroads to the 
amount he now owed the lender.  
I have noted there was a gap of around  six weeks between loan 12 being repaid 
and Mr C borrowing again.  But I dont think  that was anywhere near long enough  
to give Sunny  any confidence that Mr Cs finances had returned again to a more 
stable footing.
Between loan 16 and loan 24 Mr C had multiple loans active  at the same  time. So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr C was having to 
borrow further  to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loans was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Cs indebtedness  was increasing  unsustainably.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 to 
loan 10 and from loan 16 onwards because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness  by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended  period  
of time.
the sheer  number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Cs 
ability to access  mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these high-
cost loans.
I have seen that Sunny has said that Mr Cs declared income compared to his monthly 
repayment suggests these loans were  suitable. Therefore it does not accept  the loans 
provided were unaffordable. But Sunny will know from previous decisions (as well as whats  
set out on our website) that there are cases where  this service considers the overall lending 
pattern and not just the affordability of each loan.  When  a consumer borrows numerous  
loans over a long period of time, its most  likely that the loans arent being used for their 
intended purpose of temporary cash flow problems. As Sunny will have seen, the FCA made 
it clear in a recent letter to CEOs  of high cost lending firms that a high volume of 
relending..may be symptomatic of unsustainable  lending patterns. And I think thats the 
case here.
So I dont  think Sunny should  have  agreed  to lend to Mr C from loan 6 to loan 10 and from 
loan 16 onwards. Sunny needs to pay Mr C some  compensation.
putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to give Mr C loans 6 to 10 and loans 16 onwards. So 
for each  of those loans  Sunny should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr C on the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Ref: DRN14669915The number  of loans taken from loans 6 to 10 and loan 16 onwards  means any 
information recorded about  them is adverse. So all entries about loans 6 to 10, and 
loans 16 onwards should be removed  from Mr Cs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Mr Cs complaint and direct  Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things  right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 October  2019.
