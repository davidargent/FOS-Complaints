Mr S1 complains about ReAssure Limiteds poor administration of his son's  stakeholder 
pension plan.
background 
In 2002 Mr S1 took out a stakeholder  pension plan with business M for his son (Mr S2) who 
was a small child at the time, and he would pay the index-linked contributions  on behalf of 
his son. The plan would become Mr S2s when he turned 18 in 2016, although Mr S1 would 
continue to pay the premiums. In between the plan was administered  by another  business  
before it became the responsibility of ReAssure. In May 2018 ReAssure wrote to Mr S2 to 
confirm it had transferred  the ownership  of the plan to him. 
In December 2018 Mr S1 received a letter to thank him for his enquiry about reinstating the 
plan. As neither Mr S2 or his father were aware  of having altered the terms of the plan Mr S1 
queried this with ReAssure. It turned out Mr S1s contributions hadnt stopped, but due to the 
change in ownership of the plan they had been held in a suspense account rather than being 
credited to the plan. And when they were  credited,  a letter was generated as if the plan was 
being re-instated. Mr S1 believed there  were  errors  in the 2018  annual statement, so wanted 
ReAssure to provide  an accurate reconciliation  of all contributions made  and to show that 
Mr S2 hadnt  suffered any financial disadvantage.
ReAssure responded to Mr S1 apologising for incorrectly applying some  premiums to the 
plan, which  meant the 2018 statement and its projected future valuations werent correct 
either. It enclosed a cheque for £50 for the inconvenience Mr S1 had experienced. A further 
cheque of £50 was sent without explanation.  
ReAssure also wrote directly to Mr S2 to explain that now the plan was in his name, they 
could no longer discuss it with his father.  The letter  enclosed a cheque for £100 and said 
that when the plan was put in his name,  gross  monthly payments were collected  for May and 
June 2018 instead of net ones. But it said it had refunded the overpayment of £34.04 and 
the missing premiums had now been applied to the plan. It advised  the premium would now 
be £47.34, said it would  cover the premium for December 2018  so from January 2019 the 
monthly premiums would be restarted. 
But Mr S1 remained unhappy with ReAssures resolution so in February 2019 he brought his 
complaint to this service.  He wanted a root and branch  investigation and for us to hold this 
firm accountable for all the errors and get them to pull their socks  up. 
Mr S1 they had received three cheques from ReAssure in January 2019.  Mr S2 received one 
cheque for £100  and hed received  two cheques of £50. None were initially presented  but 
when they finally tried in September  2019  the cheques had been stopped. Mr S1 thought  
£500 would  be fairer, mainly for the time and trouble hes been put to sorting things out. 
One of our investigators  looked into the complaint  and was satisfied  the plan had been 
restored to the position it should have been  in, and no financial loss had occurred. And while 
ReAssure had made some errors, which should have been resolved more quickly,  she 
considered the compensation  it offered was fair and reasonable in the circumstances. 
Mr S1 (on behalf of Mr S2) didnt agree and wanted  the complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman so its been passed  to me for a review.  
Ref: DRN57978212my provisional decision
In my provisional decision I said in summary  that the investigators acceptance of 
ReAssures confirmation  that the premiums had been applied  to the plan correctly turned out 
to be not quite right. 
The change of ownership of the plan to Mr S2 caused premiums  totalling £329.58 to be held 
in a suspense  account. This resulted in it being  marked as paid up and then subsequently 
reinstated, and the letter about this triggered  the complaint. I bore in mind  the plan was set 
up by M prior to becoming the responsibility of ReAssure. 
And although Mr S1 and Mr S2 may have assumed it would happen automatically, theres  
nothing in the plan terms and conditions  to set out how and when  the plan should have 
transferred into Mr S2s name when he turned 18, and no review system based  around his 
birthday. And even  after the transfer  into Mr S2s name, Mr S1 still intended to pay the 
premiums for his son, whos  in education  rather than working.  
ReAssure has confirmed  the premiums are up to date until May 2019. For the period from 
June 2017 to May 2018 premiums totalling  £557.86  were received and for the period June 
2018 to May 2019 premiums totalling  £556.70  were received. So a total of £1,114.56 was 
expected and received. However  this included the payment for December 2018 which 
ReAssure said it would  cover (meaning it would reimburse this to Mr S1). ReAssure has 
explained due to the tax relief it wasnt possible for it to credit the plan with the missing 
premium, so its servicing team sent Mr S1 the second cheque for £50 in respect  of that 
payment. But Mr S1 says as the cheque  came with no explanation he didnt  bank it.  
ReAssure said there  remains a shortfall  of £186.86 which  has arisen as some premiums  
were returned to the policyholder (£34.34 between June 2019  May 2020 and £146.32  
between May  July 2020). Mr S1 disputes this, but agrees it falls outside  of the time period 
covered by this decision, so he can raise this separately with ReAssure.
To put things right I said ReAssure should pay Mr S1 £50 to reimburse  him for the 
December 2018  payment  which it agreed to cover.
It should pay Mr S2 £100 for the trouble and upset caused by the errors  it made.  
And it should pay Mr S1 £100 for the trouble and upset caused to him. Although I wouldnt 
usually make an award to a representative of a complainant, in this case  Mr S1s role has 
been more than just Mr S2s representative.  From 2002 until 2018 the plan was in his name 
and he has paid the premiums throughout. So I think for some of the period  covered by this 
complaint he was a consumer in his own right as well as representing Mr S2. 
responses to my provisional  decision
ReAssure accepted the decision.  
Mr S1 accepted it reluctantly, although  he still believes compensation of £500 would be 
fairer, being £200 to replace the cheques plus £300  for the trouble and upset over an 18-
month period.  Hed been put to additional  inconvenience by the original cheques bouncing 
when they were presented, although  his bank hadnt charged for this. And when the 
compensation was divided  by the number of hours hed spent sorting things out it would  be 
below the minimum wage. 
Ref: DRN57978213my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, as both parties accepted my provisional findings I see no reason  to depart 
from them. 
As I said in my provisional decision,  this service  will normally  not award any compensation to 
a complainants representative, regardless of how much time and effort was involved in 
bringing the complaint. Our awards are made to the complainant themselves. In this case, I 
have awarded  compensation to Mr S2 even though he has had little practical involvement in 
the complaint.  But I have  made an exceptional award to Mr S1 as in this particular case,  as 
well as being Mr S2s representative, for the period until 2018 the plan was in his name. So 
in this complaint  he was both the complainant and the complainants representative. 
ReAssure stopped the original cheques when they hadnt been  presented  after many 
months, which I think is reasonable.  And Mr S1 admits he wasnt  charged or suffered a 
financial loss due to the cheques bouncing  when they were  eventually presented, so I see 
no reason to award additional compensation for this.
So I believe  a fair outcome  is for ReAssure to pay Mr S1 £50 to cover the December 2018 
premium as it had agreed to do, plus £100  for his trouble and upset. And to pay Mr S2 £100.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  
ReAssure Limited should  pay Mr S1 £150 and Mr S2 £100.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S1 on behalf of 
Mr S2 to accept or reject  my decision  before 3 October 2020.
