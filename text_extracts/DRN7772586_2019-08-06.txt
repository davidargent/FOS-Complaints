K821x#15complaint
Mr J has complained about the loans he took out through MYJAR Limited (MYJAR). He says 
MYJAR lent to him irresponsibly and it didnt properly undertake affordability checks. Mr J 
says that had MYJAR done more it wouldve realised he was borrowing from a number of 
other payday loan providers.   
background
The background to this complaint was set out in my provisional decision I issued in 
July 2019. An extract from this is attached and forms part of this final decision,  so I will not 
repeat that information here.  And for reference, a table outlining  Mr Js borrowing history  can 
be found at the end of the decision. 
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to partly uphold the complaint. I invited 
both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. And both Mr J and MYJAR 
have told us they have nothing further  to add. 
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Both Mr J and MYJAR have accepted the findings of the provisional decision.  And because  
there is no new information for me to consider,  I see no reason to depart from the findings 
and outcome I reached in the provisional  decision. 
So in conclusion, for the reasons outlined in the provisional decision, I think MYJAR was 
wrong to have provided Mr J with loans 5  17.
putting things right
It isnt clear from the information  provided to us by MYJAR as to whether the final loans 
outstanding balance has been  sold to a third party. If the loan hasnt been sold then the 
redress below can be carried out as described.  
However, if MYJAR has sold the outstanding  balance to a third party then it should buy the 
final loan back and then carry  out the redress below. However,  if MYJAR isnt able to buy the 
loan back then it needs to make  sure what it carries out has the same  effect  as below. 
refund  all interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 5 -16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
for loan 17, MYJAR should  remove all unpaid interest, fees and charges from the 
current outstanding  balance, meaning  Mr J only has to repay the principal sum. Then 
apply any repayments already made towards this loan as if they were made towards  
the principal sum. If after doing  this, Mr J has already paid enough for this loan to be 
fully repaid then any overpayment  needs  to be refunded, from the date of the over 
payment became due to the date of settlement. 8% simple interest per year should  
also be added
Ref: DRN77725862If after carrying out the above redress for loan 17, an outstanding balance still 
remains then MYJAR  can use the refund due for loans  5  16 to offset any 
outstanding principal due. 
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 -16 should be removed from 
Mr Js credit file. An outstanding balance may remain on loan 17 and so the credit file 
should be updated once the outstanding  principal balance  has been repaid. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr J a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
If after doing the above, Mr J still has an outstanding principal  balance  due for loan 17, then 
Mr J and MYJAR should try and come to a mutually  agreeable  repayment  plan. But Id 
remind MYJAR of its obligation to treat Mr J positively and sympathetically. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, and in my provisional  decision, I partly uphold Mr Js 
complaint. 
MYJAR Limited should put things right for Mr J as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 September 2019.

background
Mr J took 17 loans from MYJAR between December 2014 and August 2016.  Based on the information 
Ive been provided, it seems Mr J had some problems repaying his final loan, and an outstanding  
balance remains.  
A summary  of Mr Js borrowing, based on the information provided to us from MYJAR, can be found  
in the appendix at the end of this decision.
Our adjudicator felt that MYJAR  shouldnt have given Mr J loan 4 because  by this point in time Mr J 
was borrowing each month, and the amounts being taken were not significantly  decreasing. So 
MJYAR ought to have  realised there was a problem  and not provided Mr J with this loan.  
And our adjudicator also concluded that, by loan 5, Mr J was showing a pattern  of lending  that made  
this and any following loans  unsustainable. So the adjudicator thought, at this point,  MYJAR shouldve 
stopped lending to Mr J. 
Mr J appears to have accepted the adjudicators view. 
MYJAR didnt  agree with the adjudicators findings. It said that the adjudicator appears to have only 
thought about late repayments and the pattern of lending  which the adjudicator thought  showed the 
loans as being unsuitable.  The adjudicator hasnt covered whether  the loans were  affordable for Mr J, 
or referenced  any supporting documents or data that has been provided.  
No agreement could be reached,  so the case  has been passed to me for a final decision.  
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.   
The Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA)  was the regulator when MYJAR lent to Mr J. 
The FCAs  Consumer  Credit sourcebook (CONC) is the specialist sourcebook  for credit-related 
regulated activities.  It sets out the rules and guidance specific to consumer credit providers, such  as 
MYJAR. 
I am not quoting all the specific regulations  here, because  I would expect  MYJAR to be familiar with 
these through  previous ombudsman  decisions, particularly recent decisions, which set these  rules out 
in more detail.
It is important to note that the FCA didnt, and doesnt, specify exactly  how an assessment of 
affordability is to be carried out but the extent and scope and the types  and sources of information 
to use needed to be enough to be able to reasonably assess the sustainability of the arrangement  for 
the consumer.
In other words the assessment needs to be consumer-focussed. It is not an assessment of the risk to 
the lender of not recovering the credit but of the risk to the consumer  of incurring  financial difficulties 
or experiencing significant  adverse consequence as a result of the decision to lend.
As set out in CONC, the risk to the consumer directly  relates  to the particulars  of the lending and the 
circumstances of the consumer. Therefore, a lenders  assessment of creditworthiness  would likely 
need to be flexible. That is to say, what  is sufficient  for one consumer might not be for another, or 
indeed what might  be sufficient for a consumer in one circumstance might not be so for the same 
consumer in other  circumstances.
Ref: DRN77725864Bearing the above in mind, I would expect an assessment of creditworthiness to vary with 
circumstance. In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance, the greater the potential  risk 
to the consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way.  Certain factors  might point 
to the fact that MYJAR should fairly  and reasonably  have done  more  to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include, but are not limited to:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So MYJAR  was required to establish whether Mr J could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. The loan 
payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication Mr J could sustainably  make his 
repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because CONC defines  sustainable  as being  without undue  difficulties and in particular 
the customer should be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; and without having to borrow  to meet the repayments. 
So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower  
wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably - if theyre  unlikely to be able to make them  
without borrowing further. 
MYJAR has told this service it carried out detailed and extensive checks  before agreeing to lend to Mr 
J. It says it asked Mr J about  his employment status, income and monthly  expenses. It also said it 
carried out a check of his credit file as well as using its own internal systems  to decide whether the 
loans were affordable.  
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Js complaint. But, as MJYAR and Mr J dont appear to be unhappy  about  
the adjudicators  findings  in relation to loans 1  3, these  loans appear are no longer in dispute,  so I 
wont be reviewing these loans as part of my decision. 
Our adjudicator thought that MYJAR shouldnt  have provided Mr J with loan 4, because there were 
signs that he was having problems  repaying  his previous  loans. Ive thought carefully about whether 
MYJAR made  an error in relation to this loan. But, having reviewed the information  available  to me, I 
dont think this loan should be upheld, and Ive explained my reasons below.
By the time of loan 4 Mr J had been borrowing for a little over 6 months and there was a pattern  
emerging in Mr Js borrowing, which suggested he would likely return for a new loan within  2 or 3 
weeks of repaying  his previous loan. But in the circumstances of this case, I dont think that on its 
own, was sufficient to think that Mr J shouldnt  have been given this loan. 
I think  the checks MYJAR carried out for this loan were proportionate, taking into account the number 
of loans, the amounts being borrowed, as well as what MYJAR knew  about Mr Js circumstances at 
the time. 
Ref: DRN77725865There also wasnt  anything in the information  MYJAR gathered up to this point to give it cause for 
concern that either  the loan wasnt affordable or unsustainable for Mr J in any other way. So for the 
reason Ive outlined above, I dont think MYJAR was wrong to have provided  him with this loan. 
But, like the adjudicator,  Ive also looked at the overall pattern of MYJARs lending history  with Mr J, 
with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which  MYJAR should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Js case, I think that this point was reached by loan 5. I say 
this because:
There was an emerging pattern between loans 1 - 4 of Mr J taking new loans shortly  after 
repaying previous ones.  I think  that by loan 5, MYJAR ought fairly and reasonably to have 
regarded that pattern  as established. By the fifth loan Mr J had either  taken  a new loan, or 
had repayments due to an existing loan for nearly the last eight months.  
From loan 5 onwards  Mr J was provided with a new loan the majority of the time on the same 
day he settled a previous loan and there was no sustained, significant  reduction in his 
borrowing. So MYJAR ought to have  realised  it was more likely  than not Mr J was having  to 
borrow further  to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances,  and 
that Mr Js indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr J wasnt reducing the amounts he owed  to MYJAR. For example, loan 16 was taken  out 
19 months after Mr Js first loan was approved,  and the value of this loan was for three times 
the sum of his first loan. 
Over the 12 month period from loan 5 to loan 17, there  were  only around 45 days  when Mr J 
was not indebted to MYJAR.  Mr J had paid large amounts  of interest too, so in effect, 
serviced a debt to MYJAR  over an extended period.
By loan 17, Mr J had already been borrowing  from MYJAR for over 18 months, yet this final 
loan was due to run for a period of 12 months. So, in approving this loan, MYJAR effectively 
extended Mr Js indebtedness for a further year.  The result  of this wouldve  meant that Mr Js 
entire borrowing  period wouldve been over two and half years.  
I think  that Mr J lost out because  MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing  from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Js indebtedness  by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time and
the sheer number of loans  was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Js ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding the complaint about loans  5-17 and MYJAR  should put things right as set out below.
