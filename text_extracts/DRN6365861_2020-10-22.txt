K820x#14complaint
Mrs E says Lloyds Bank PLC mis-sold  her a payment protection  insurance  (PPI)  policy. 
background and summary to complaint
Mrs E bought the policy in 1996  at the same time as taking out a credit  card.  Due to the time 
that has passed, its not totally clear how Mrs E applied for her credit  card and PPI policy,  
but Mrs E recalls it may have been in a branch. 
At the time,  Mrs E was employed as a Postlady.  She has told us she was entitled  to up to 
three months sick pay from her employer, but she had no other  means of repaying her credit 
card should  she be unable to work. She has not indicated she would have been  entitled to 
any redundancy pay. Mrs E has mentioned a medical procedure  she had but this was some 
two years after she took out the PPI. So it would seem she was in good  health at the time of 
the sale. 
The policy provided  cover  for accident, sickness, and unemployment  subject to its 
exclusions and limitations. It offered to repay  10% of Mrs Es credit card balance  in the event 
of a successful claim. At the time,  it cost between £0.59 and £0.79p  per £100 of the monthly 
outstanding balance. The premium would continue to have to be paid during a successful 
claim and it did attract  interest.  
Lloyds has sent us screenshots to show that the credit card account closed in August  2007.
Mrs Es representative has made  lengthy and substantial representations  on her behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have  read and considered  them all carefully. In 
summary, Mrs Es representative says:
Lloyds failed to meet the sales standards which applied at the time.  In those 
circumstances, applying  the regulators rules and guidance for businesses  on 
handling PPI complaints  under  DISP  App 3, it should be presumed Mrs E wouldnt 
have taken out the policy and the complaint should be upheld.  Mrs Es 
representatives believe there to be no evidence to rebut that presumption;
The policy excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress,  which  are some  of the 
most common reasons people  are off work. This significantly reduced  the value of 
cover;
The true costs including interest  and the fact it was unlikely you could make  a 
successful claim  meant the policy was of inherently poor value as shown by the low 
claims ratio. The common law duty of utmost good  faith means Lloyds should have 
told Mrs E about the poor value; 
The common law duty of utmost good faith also means Lloyds should have explained 
the significance  of the exclusions  and limitations of cover  to Mrs E and the impact  
they would  have had on her chances  of making  a claim; and 
The information Mrs E received was misleading.  These policies were promoted  as 
providing peace of mind, but the number of exclusions and limitations on the scope of 
the cover  meant this was untrue.
Ref: DRN63658612Our adjudicator did not uphold the complaint   both parties have seen and provided their 
responses to the adjudicators opinion. Mrs E disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  for 
several reasons.  
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
relevant considerations
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, I am required to take into account: relevant 
law and regulations;  relevant  regulators  rules,  guidance and standards; relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published  some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Mrs Es. I dont intend to set that out in 
much detail here but Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Es complaint.
This sale took place  in 1996 before the General Insurance Standards Council (GISC) 
published its code  of practice in June 2000  and before the sale of general insurance 
products like this became  regulated in January 2005. So, the GISC Code, the FSAs (and 
FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses  and insurance conduct rules (ICOB and 
ICOBs) arent applicable to this complaint,  nor is the FCAs Perimeter  Guidance (PERG). 
The credit agreement itself concluded  in August 2007. That means  the unfair relationship  
provisions set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit  Act, the Supreme Court judgment in 
Plevin about s.140  of that Act and the rules and guidance made  by the FCA about the 
handling of complaints about the non-disclosure of commission in light of the Plevin 
judgment, arent applicable. 
There were a number of industry codes in existence  at that time, which I am satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. In particular,  The Association of British Insurers  General Insurance Business 
Code of Practice for all intermediaries  (Including  Employees of Insurance Companies) other  
than Registered Insurance Brokers  The ABI Code. 
The ABI Code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement  of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries  
I consider these publications to be indicative of the standards of good practice expected  of 
intermediaries like Lloyds  at the time. So Im satisfied I should take the ABI Code and these 
Ref: DRN63658613other publications into account  when  deciding, what is in my opinion,  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of Mrs Es case.  
 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including:  the law relating to 
negligence, misrepresentation and contract  (including the express  and implied duty on 
professional advisers  to give advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence); the law 
relating to the duty of utmost good faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness.  
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001,  Im also required  to take into account  what 
determination the relevant former  scheme   in this case the Office of the Banking  
Ombudsman  might have been expected  to reach  in relation to an equivalent complaint. I 
note that under the Banking  Ombudsmans terms of reference the Ombudsman  was 
required to decide  complaints by reference  to what was, in his opinion,  fair and reasonable in 
all the circumstances   and that the Ombudsman was required to observe any applicable 
rule of law or relevant judicial authority. 
I am also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first 
issued by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating to the 
sale of PPI. This sale took place before insurance mediation became a regulated  activity,  so 
Lloyds was required to take into account the provisions in DISP  App 3 as if they were 
guidance when  considering Mrs Es complaint. 
key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account,  it seems to me that the key questions I need  
to consider in deciding  what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of 
this complaint, are:
If Lloyds gave advice,  whether  it advised Mrs E with reasonable care and skill  in 
particular, whether the policy  was appropriate  or suitable for her, given her needs 
and circumstances.  
Whether Lloyds gave Mrs E sufficient,  appropriate and timely information to enable 
her to make an informed choice about  whether to take out the policy,  including  
drawing to her attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading  way  
the main provisions of the policy and significant  limitations and exclusions.  
If, having considered  these questions,  I determine the complaint in favour of Mrs E, I 
must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Mrs E suffered loss or 
damage and what  I consider would amount to fair compensation for that loss or 
damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Mrs E and 
Lloyds, Ive decided  not to uphold  Mrs Es complaint. Ive set out my reasoning below. 
did Mrs E know  she had a choice?
Lloyds had to make it clear that the PPI policy was optional. 
Mrs E has not indicated at all she did not consent to taking out the PPI. Whilst Lloyds hasnt 
been able to provide the actual credit card application Mrs E completed  it has provided a 
Ref: DRN63658614sample copy of the form that was in use around  that time.  This has a section headed for the 
PPI and this sets out briefly what the PPI covers and information about how much per £100 
will be charged. Plus it sets out the basic eligibility criteria.  Mrs E would have had to tick this 
box to select the PPI and also to confirm her circumstances were such that she was eligible. 
Taking everything into account,  I think its more likely than not that Mrs E knew  the policy 
was optional and she agreed to take it out without undue  pressure.  
did Lloyds provide  advice?
Lloyds has indicated it doesnt know if advice was provided but has taken the approach that 
it was in this sale,  as this would  place  stricter requirements on it when the PPI was taken 
out. Mrs E has indicated she does not recall that advice  was provided during this sale. 
Looking at what the parties  have said and the limited information available  Im persuaded 
that it is fair and reasonable to take the approach that Lloyds did provide advice at the time 
of the sale.
This means  Lloyds had to advise Mrs E with reasonable care and skill, in particular whether 
the policy was appropriate or suitable given her needs and circumstances.
the advice
I dont know what steps Lloyds took to establish whether the policy  was a suitable 
recommendation for Mrs E. It seems Mrs E cant remember clearly what  happened and there 
is no record of what the adviser discussed  in relation to the policy. This is unsurprising  in 
respect of a sale during a meeting. The adviser  would  have had some  limited information 
about Mrs Es financial circumstances, but there  is no specific  evidence  to show  the adviser 
took steps to establish whether Mrs E would have been caught by the significant  exclusions 
and limitations which  might have meant the policy did not fully meet her needs. For example, 
there is nothing to suggest  Lloyds considered whether Mrs E had any pre-existing medical  
conditions.
Overall, on the balance of probabilities I am not persuaded that Lloyds  did all it should have 
done to determine whether the policy was suitable for Mrs E given her circumstances. So Im 
not persuaded Lloyds advised with reasonable  care and skill.
While Im not persuaded Lloyds did all it should  have done  to make sure the policy was 
suitable for Mrs E, I do think  its more likely  than not that the policy  was ultimately  suitable  for 
her. In reaching  that conclusion  Ive taken into consideration:
Mrs E met the eligibility criteria for the policy.
Mrs E had a need for the policy   it seems likely that Mrs Es ability to continue to 
meet her credit card repayments would  have been put under strain if she was not 
working for an extended period  of time  even allowing for the sick pay benefits she 
says she would  have  been entitled to.
The monthly cost of the policy appears  to have  been affordable for Mrs E.
The exclusions and limitations didnt make the policy unsuitable  for Mrs E. There  was 
nothing about  Mrs Es employment or occupation  which  would have made it difficult  
Ref: DRN63658615for her to claim. Regarding pre-existing medical  conditions, Mrs E has told us about a 
caesarean section she had in 1998,  but the evidence provided  indicates this sale 
took place in 1996 which was before  the procedure Mrs E had. So this doesnt 
appear to be caught by the policy limitations  and exclusions and no information has 
been provided to indicate  Mrs E wasnt in good health at the time of the sale.  
While  the policy would  only pay benefits  for a maximum of 12 months for each claim 
for accident, sickness or unemployment, it still provided useful cover given Mrs Es 
circumstances and the fact the policy could have cleared her outstanding card 
balance.
Ive also considered whether, when providing  advice,  Lloyds  gave Mrs E sufficient 
information about the cover provided by the policy to enable her to understand what  Lloyds 
was recommending to her and make an informed decision  about  whether to follow that 
advice and take out the policy.
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not Mrs E was given a very broad  description of what the 
policy was intended  to cover (that is, that the policy would protect her card payments in the 
event she was unable  to work through accident,  sickness or unemployment).  I have reached 
this conclusion because  I think  Mrs E would have been told this  at the very least  during 
the discussion with the adviser.  I think its unlikely Mrs E would have taken  out the policy  
without any sense of what the policy was. Looking  at the sample application form, similar to 
what Mrs E would have signed,  this also described  the policy as to cover  repayments for 
accident, sickness and unemployment, which would have given her some idea of what the 
policy was for.
I am also satisfied Mrs E would have  realised the policy  wasnt free and its likely she would 
have had some understanding of how much the policy cost before  agreeing  to take it out.
But the evidence  from the time of the sale doesnt  tell us whether Lloyds gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit, the actual cost (the fact that the premiums  
would be added to the account balance, attracting interest if unpaid  at the end of the month, 
and were payable  during  a claim) or about  the exclusions  and limitations, before Mrs E 
agreed to take out the policy.  Even if that information were in a leaflet or policy summary 
Mrs E might have been given, I think its more likely than not that she based her decision on 
the things she was told, rather than on anything she was given.
Overall, having considered the parties  representations about what  happened,  while Im 
satisfied that the policy  was a suitable recommendation for Mrs E, Im not persuaded Lloyds 
did enough to present  information about  the policy it was recommending in a way that was 
fair and reasonable to Mrs E. Im not persuaded  that Lloyds gave Mrs E all of the information  
she needed about the policy to make an informed decision about whether to follow  the 
recommendation and take out the policy.
Ive considered how my findings interact  with the FCAs  list of significant failings in its 
guidance for firms handling  PPI complaints  set out at DISP  App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, Im persuaded that there were significant failings in this case.
In addition to the failings  Ive highlighted above,  Mrs Es representative has raised a number  
of general points in regards  to the requirements on a business when providing information  in 
Ref: DRN63658616PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like Mrs Es. Ive considered 
these carefully and summarised them  as:
The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Mrs Es representative considers  to be poor 
value  and the fact that much of the premium went  to the business  rather than the 
insurer. 
The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  shouldnt have just 
told Mrs E about the limitations and exclusions, it should have gone  further  and 
explained the significance of them to her. 
Im not persuaded by Mrs Es representatives  views on this. The duty of utmost good faith in 
insurance law imposed a duty on both parties  to the contract  to disclose material facts  and 
not to make  material misrepresentations. While I cannot be certain what  a court would say  
I think its unlikely a court would find that this extended to the insurer  having  to disclose the 
claims ratio information or explaining  the significance of the limitations and exclusions in the 
way Mrs E has suggested. And taking into account the law, industry codes and standards of 
good industry practice applicable to this complaint,  I dont think its fair and reasonable to 
conclude that Lloyds ought  to have done either. 
what effect did Lloydss shortcomings have on Mrs E? To what extent  did Mrs E suffer 
loss or damage as a result?
Ive found that Lloyds  didnt do all it should have done when it sold this policy to Mrs E. So I 
have gone on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to conclude Mrs E 
suffered loss and damage as a result. To answer  this, I must decide  whether or not Mrs E 
would have still taken  out the policy, had Lloyds done things properly. 
While Im not persuaded that Lloyds took the steps  it should  have done to establish  whether 
the policy it recommended was suitable  for Mrs E, Ive found that the policy  was ultimately 
suitable for her.
In those circumstances it seems to me that, whether  or not Mrs E has suffered loss or 
damage in this case primarily depends  on whether, if Lloyds had explained  things properly, 
Mrs E would have acted differently, or whether  she would have taken out the policy in any 
event.
Mrs E says she would  not have  taken it out and believes that I should  presume this to be the 
case given the significant failings identified  above. I have considered  the representations of 
both sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
Deciding whether  to follow advice to take out insurance requires the consumer to weigh up a 
number of factors before  deciding  whether to proceed. Effectively the consumer has to 
weigh up the advice to take out the policy, the cost of doing so given the benefits offered in 
return and the potential consequences they will suffer if they dont have  insurance,  should 
the risks come  to fruition.
The evidence in this case suggests that Mrs E had some interest in taking out payment 
protection insurance. By this I mean  when Lloyds  advised her that there was a suitable  
product she could buy that would protect  her credit card payments in the event she was 
unable to work because of accident, sickness and unemployment, she concluded  she 
Ref: DRN63658617wanted that product. But she made  that decision based on incomplete  information, meaning 
what she thought  she was getting is not exactly what  she got. 
As I explained earlier, Im satisfied from the evidence about  Mrs Es circumstances at the 
time of the sale that the policy was not fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her. 
In relation to the costs, Im satisfied Mrs E ought  reasonably to have known  she would have 
to pay something for the PPI and that it would cover  10% of her outstanding balance  this 
would have been indicated on the application  form Mrs E signed.  But I accept that Lloyds 
didnt make clear the on-going cost information.  So while Mrs E didnt know some things, the 
ultimate position in the event of a successful claim was not dissimilar to what  she would 
reasonably have thought  from the information she based her decision to take out the policy  
on and found  acceptable. 
Possibly the most significant differences between what Mrs E thought she had bought and 
what she actually bought were the following:
The policy excluded claims relating to medical  conditions that Mrs E had consulted  or 
received treatment for, from a doctor, in the 12 months period  prior to the 
commencement date of the insurance;  
The policy contained limitations on claims relating to back and mental health 
conditions placing more onerous evidential requirements to support a claim  on those 
grounds;
The policy limited, and in some situations,  excluded unemployment  cover  if Mrs E 
wasnt a permanent employee.
I do accept that there is a possibility that the limitations and exclusions above might  well 
have caused Mrs E pause for thought  and may well have caused her to conclude  that the 
policy wasnt as good as she thought, and she might have decided not to proceed. The 
limitations on the cover, when coupled with the other shortcomings in this sale, might  have 
dissuaded some  consumers in slightly different circumstances from Mrs E from taking out 
the policy. 
But, the evidence  about Mrs Es circumstances  at the time of sale shows that the policy  
wasnt fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her. she was eligible for its benefits and it 
provided cover that, despite its limitations  and exclusions, couldve proved  valuable to her 
should the insured risks have become a reality. I also havent seen any evidence to suggest 
she wouldve been caught by any of the significant  exclusions   Mrs E didnt  have any pre-
existing medical conditions at the time of the sale and was in permanent employment. So, I 
still think she had some good reasons to take the policy out.
I accept back pain and mental health conditions are common problems and the steps 
required to make a disability claim for these conditions were  more onerous than Mrs E might 
reasonably have expected. But its unlikely [he/she/they]  would  have expected to be able to 
make a disability claim without having  to provide some  evidence to support that claim. And 
while this limitation  might  have dissuaded  some consumers in slightly  different 
circumstances to Mrs E from taking out the policy, Mrs E, in her circumstances, still had 
some good  reasons to take it out.
Ref: DRN63658618Having considered all of the evidence  and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not that Mrs E would  still have taken out the PPI. The policy was sufficiently close  to 
what she thought  she was and I think the policy could provide a useful  benefit  in a difficult  
time, notwithstanding her employment benefits.  And in those circumstances, I consider it 
more likely than not that she would have  taken out the policy  in any event.  
Mrs Es representatives say the rules about how to handle PPI complaints (DISP App 3) 
make it clear  that, where  a significant  failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have  taken out PPI, unless  there  is evidence  to outweigh  the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms,  but it is a relevant  consideration, so I take it into account along 
with many other things  when I decide  what is in my opinion  fair and reasonable. Considering  
the purpose of the guidance, I dont  think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken.  
I have thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, I have found  it would be reasonable to conclude  there  
were substantial flaws  in the sales  process.  In those  circumstances, DISP App 3 says it 
should be presumed Mrs E would not have bought the PPI she bought  unless, in the 
particular circumstances  of the complaint, there is evidence to rebut the presumption. 
I am satisfied, applying DISP App 3, it is reasonable to conclude  the presumption  is rebutted 
in the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account Mrs Es 
circumstances as detailed  above, I consider it reasonable to conclude  the position  Mrs E 
found herself in as a result of the sale was the same position  she would have been in had 
the breach or significant  failings not occurred. 
Mrs E believes the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws  in the sales process 
were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were  highly material and we have failed to give 
proper weight to the evidence  including her own comments  that she would not have taken 
out the policy. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance  for firms  set out at DISP App 3 (which  I 
dont consider I am), I am only doing so because  I dont  consider, in this case, that it would 
represent fair compensation to put Mrs E in the position she would have been in if she had 
not bought the policy.  
That is because,  while I accept its possible she wouldnt have taken out the policy, I am 
satisfied that of the two possibilities, its more likely than not that she would  still have taken 
out the PPI had she been given clear,  fair and not misleading information about the policy 
she was buying.  So Im not persuaded it would be fair and reasonable in those 
circumstances, to conclude Lloyds should pay Mrs E compensation, as that would put her in 
a better  position than she would have been in if everything had happened  as it should have 
done. 
Im also aware that Mrs E thinks Lloyds misrepresented  the terms of the policy in how it 
described the PPI.  While I accept there is a possibility a court  might  conclude some of 
Lloydss statements misrepresented the contract,  in my opinion  the reason why Lloyds failed 
to act fairly  and reasonably was not because of what it did or didnt say in the information it 
provided  but because  the overall information  Lloyds gave Mrs E, in the way it did, was 
Ref: DRN63658619insufficient to meet  the standards I consider it fair and reasonable to expect it to have met in 
1996 when providing information  about an insurance  policy.  
Ive also thought about the approach Mrs Es representative says a court might take if it were 
to find Lloyds negligently misrepresented the contract to Mrs E and about the remedy  a court  
might award if it were  to find that Lloyds had been in breach of its duty of utmost good  faith.  
But this doesnt  persuade  me to alter my conclusions about what  is fair and reasonable in all 
the circumstances of the complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the 
circumstances of this case.  For the reasons Ive already set out I dont think it would be fair 
and reasonable to put Mrs E in a better position  than if everything  had happened  as it should 
have done. 
my decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 November  2020.
