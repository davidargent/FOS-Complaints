K820x#14complaint
This complaint is about a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy  taken out in 2006 
alongside a credit card. Mrs Y says Capital One (Europe) plc mis-sold her the PPI.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  the sale of PPI on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding 
Mrs Ys case.
Having done this, Ive decided the policy wasnt mis-sold because:
Capital One says Mrs Y took the PPI during  a phone call to activate  the card. It no 
longer has a recording of the call which isnt surprising  given how long ago the policy 
was sold. But it has given us the script it expected  its representatives to follow  during  
these types of calls. The script prompted the advisor  to explain PPI was optional and 
asked for agreement for the policy to be added  to the card. Based on what  we know 
about how Capital One sold PPI at the time, I think its likely the script would have been 
followed during  the call. And I think its unlikely Capital One would have added the PPI 
without Mrs Y indicating  she wanted  it. 
Based  on everything Ive seen,  I dont think Capital One recommended  the PPI to Mrs Y 
so it didnt have to check if it was right for her. But it did have to make sure she got the 
information she needed to decide  if it was right for her.  
Its possible  the information Capital One gave  Mrs Y about the PPI wasnt as clear  as it 
shouldve been.  But based on what Ive seen of her circumstances at the time it doesnt 
look like she was affected  by any of the exclusions  to or limits on the PPI cover.  And the 
PPI wouldve paid out on top of any sick pay Mrs Y was entitled to, as well as helping  
her cover payments if she lost her job. And I think it would  have  been  useful for her if 
something went wrong. It also looks like the PPI was affordable. 
So I dont  think better information about the PPI would have put her off taking out the 
cover. 
Which means Capital One doesnt have to pay back  all of the cost of the PPI to Mrs Y. 
But Capital One has paid back some of the cost of the PPI to Mrs Y because: 
Capital One got a high level of commission and profit share  (more than 50% of the PPI 
premium) - so it should have told Mrs Y about that. Because  Capital One didnt tell     
Mrs Y, that was unfair.  
To put that right, Capital One has paid back  the amount of commission and profit share 
that was above 50% of the PPI premium - and I think that is fair in this case.
my final decision
The PPI policy wasnt mis-sold  so Capital One (Europe) plc does not have to pay back all 
of the cost of the PPI to Mrs Y.
Ref: DRN11927202But Capital One (Europe) plc does have  to pay back to Mrs Y any commission  and profit  
share it got that was more than 50% of the PPI premium. I understand it has already done 
this, so I dont award any further compensation. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs Y to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 October  2019.
