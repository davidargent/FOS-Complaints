K821x#15complaint
Mr A complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) was 
irresponsible to lend to him.
background
Mr A had 12 loans from Sunny between July 2017 and August 2018 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 6 Jul 2017 £200 6m £64.41 29 Dec 2017 24 Jul 2017
2 15 Jul 2017 £150 6m £45.41 29 Dec 2017 24 Jul 2017
3 6 Sep 2017  £200 6m £63.42 28 Feb 2018 3 Oct 2017
4 25 Nov 2017 £200 216d £66.67 29 Jun 2018 On time
5 4 Jan 2018 £250 176d £80.58 29 Jun 2018 23 May 2018
6 5 Apr 2018 £250 176d £80.57 28 Sep 2018 23 May 2018

10 2 Jul 2018 £200 182d £66.14 31 Dec 2018 9 Jul 2018 
11 17 Aug 2018 £50 167d £14.88 31 Jan 2019 On time
12 22 Aug 2018 £50 190d £16.67 28 Feb 2019 16 Oct 2018
Mr A says his borrowing steadily increased  and he was using  multiple short-term lenders.  He 
says he was struggling to pay his priority  bills and found himself  further  in debt over time.
Sunny says it carried out affordability and creditworthiness checks  before each application. It 
says its checks were  proportionate and nothing  indicated the loans were unaffordable.
Our adjudicator recommended  Mr As complaint  should be upheld in part. She found that, by 
loan 6, Mr As pattern  of borrowing suggested  he had become reliant on short-term loans. 
She recommended interest and charges be refunded on loans  6 to 12 (plus 8% statutory 
interest) and that the loans  should be removed from Mr As credit  file.
Sunny responded to say, in summary,  that Mr As repayments as a percentage of his income  
suggested the loans were  affordable.  It adds  that the amounts borrowed remained roughly 
the same  and that all loans were paid on time or early.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr A could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN14768012But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr A could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr As complaint.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr A, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr As case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr A was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of a previous 
one. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr A was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr As indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
When Mr A applied  for loan 6, he already  had two outstanding Sunny loans and 
neither they, nor loan 6, were  repaid  before Mr A was approved for loan 7;
Mr A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 10 was 
taken out a year after Mr As first and it was for the same amount. Mr A had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
Ref: DRN14768013I think that Mr A lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr As 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 12 and Sunny should  put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading  as 
Sunny) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr A paid on loans 6 to 12;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 12 should be removed from 
Mr As credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr A a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 November 2019.
