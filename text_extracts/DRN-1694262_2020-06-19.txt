The complaint
This complaint has been brought by Mr K on behalf of his company K. Hes unhappy that 
Lloyds Bank PLC turned down his request for a loan to buy his commercial premises. 
The details of this complaint are well-known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision. Although Ive read and 
considered the whole file, Ill keep my comments to what I think is relevant. If I dont 
comment on any specific point, its not because Ive not considered it but because I dont 
think I need to comment on it in order to reach the right outcome.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
It's not my role to tell a lender whether (or not) to lend to a consumer or business. 
Each lender has its own risk appetite. Just because a different lender agreed to the 
proposal, doesnt mean Lloyds was wrong to turn it down.
I appreciate Mr K feels Lloyds is being unfair. But lenders can use their commercial 
judgement to decide how much, if anything, to lend. My role is to ensure such 
judgement is applied fairly and reasonably; it isnt to substitute my judgement for the 
lenders.
In this case, Lloyds applied its lending criteria to the proposal. These criteria are 
commercially sensitive, so were unable to disclose them, but Im satisfied Lloyds 
fairly applied them. It follows that Im satisfied Lloyds didnt act unreasonably in not 
agreeing to the proposal put forward.
 
My final decision
Whilst I understand Mr Ks frustration, for the above reasons, I dont uphold the 
complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask K to 
accept or reject my decision before 17 July 2020.
