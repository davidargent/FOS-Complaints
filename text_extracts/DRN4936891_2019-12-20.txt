checks before lending to him.

Mr M says Sunny  didnt  reassess his income  or outgoings  for each loan.  He says the high 
repayments meant he couldnt afford  priority bills and he took out other  short-term  loans as a 
result. He says Sunny  was unsympathetic  to the debt spiral  he became stuck  in.
Sunny says it carried out affordability and creditworthiness checks  at the time of each loan 
application. It says that it considered it acted responsibly by approving the loans.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He found that by loan 6, 
Mr Ms pattern of borrowing suggested  he had become persistently reliant on short-term  
loans. He recommended  Sunny should refund  interest and charges on loans 6 and 7 (plus 
8% statutory interest) and that it should  remove the loans from Mr Ms credit  file.
Sunny responded to say, in summary,  that having  multiple loans is not an indication  that the 
lending was unsustainable. It adds that four of the loans were  repaid early and the 
repayments were a small percentage of Mr Ms income.
my provisional decision
I issued my provisional decision to Mr M and to Sunny on 21 November 2019. I summarise  
my findings  here:
I was satisfied that Sunny did enough  checks before approving loans  1 to 3 and there 
was nothing to indicate the loans were unaffordable;
I considered Sunny  should have asked  Mr M whether he had any other short-term 
loans before it approved loan 4. But I found  no evidence  to indicate Mr M was having 
problems managing his money  in that way and the repayments appeared affordable;
Because of Mr Ms borrowing pattern, I considered a full financial review was 
proportionate for loans 5, 6 and 7. But I had a look at what  such a review  was likely 
to have found and couldnt  conclude loans 5 and 6 were unaffordable to Mr M;
A full review showed it was likely Mr M didnt have enough disposable income to 
sustainably repay loans 4, 6 and 7. So I found Sunny was wrong to approve  loan 7.
Ref: DRN49368912Mr M accepted my provisional decision.
Sunny also agreed  with the outcome of my provisional decision,  but it clarified that it was for 
different reasons. It said its checks showed  loan 7 was affordable, especially as it was 
repayable over six months.  But Sunny acknowledged  it should have contacted  Mr M when 
he applied  for loan 7 to discuss  the reasons for his significant reduction in income.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both parties agreed with the outcome in my provisional decision, and no new information 
was provided, I see no reason to depart from it.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading  as 
Sunny) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr M paid on loan 7;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loan 7, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding on loan 7, and the outstanding amounts  on loans 4 and 6, and 
pay any balance to Mr M; 
Arrange to repay any portion  of the sum due to the third party debt collector  that is 
made up of interest and charges on loan 7  including any added  by the third party;
Pay Mr M interest and charges he has already  paid to the third party for loan 7, plus 
8% interest simple per annum on each  amount  from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement;
Remove any negative  information about loan 7 from Mr Ms credit file once  it  has 
been repaid;
Request the third party to remove  any adverse information it may have recorded 
about loan 7 once it has been repaid.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one. If Sunny intends to 
apply the refund to reduce  any outstanding  capital  balance, it must do so after deducting  the 
tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 January 2020.
