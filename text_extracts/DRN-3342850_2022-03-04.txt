The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as S is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) transferred its business relationship to its Global Restructuring Group (GRG) and 
with several aspects of the service it received from GRG following that transfer. 
What happened
S had a property portfolio which, In July 2006, was valued at approximately £3,000,000. S 
also had informal business relationships with a group of other companies (The Group) from 
which it was formally separate, including that one of Ss directors (The Director) was also a 
director of the companies in The Group.
In October 2012, Ss business relationship was transferred by NatWest to GRG, ostensibly 
because of the declining financial performance of the companies in The Group, which 
included overdue creditors and cashflow issues.
In 2014, a proposal was made by The Director to financially restructure The Group. This 
restructuring was to be partly funded by an increase in Ss loan facility by £280,000.
This proposal was approved by NatWest with the condition that a formal red book valuation 
of the existing security (the property portfolio) be undertaken by a NatWest approved valuer 
with the cost of the valuation to be borne by S.
S agreed to the valuation and was given a choice of two valuers from which it selected one. 
The valuation took place in November 2014 at which time the property portfolio was valued 
at £1,500,000 on a vacant possession basis and £1,700,000 subject to the existing leases. 
Subsequently, S was charged £2,400 for the valuation fee.
In March 2016, S refinanced with another financial institution and repaid NatWests 
borrowing in full. 
In 2018, S raised a complaint against NatWest because it wasnt happy with the 2014 
valuation, which S felt was unrealistically low and had unfairly affected NatWests attitude 
toward the ongoing business relationship past that date. S also wasnt happy that it had 
been transferred to GRG in 2012, or with other aspects of the service it had received from 
GRG subsequent to being transferred to it.
NatWest felt that it had managed Ss business relationship fairly and reasonably and so it 
didnt uphold the complaint.
S wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so it referred its complaint to this service. One of 
our investigators looked at this complaint. But they felt that it had been reasonable for 
NatWest to have transferred S to GRG when it did, and they didnt feel that Ss ongoing 
business relationship had been unfairly managed following the transfer. So, they also didnt 
uphold Ss complaint.
S remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
One of Ss complaint points is that it feels that there was no justifiable reason for NatWest to 
have transferred its business relationship to GRG. S point out that it isnt formally connected 
to The Group, and as such feels that the deteriorating financial performance of the 
companies within The Group shouldnt have had any bearing on the status of Ss own 
business relationship with NatWest.
I can appreciate Ss position here. But its at the discretion of NatWest as to how they 
choose to manage a business relationship with a client company such as S. And while S are 
correct in stating that it has no formal connection with the companies within The Group, 
informal connections do exist, including that S is engaged in business activities in 
compliment with The Group, that S and The Group share a common director (The Director), 
and that the restructuring proposal made by The Director on behalf of The Group was to be 
partly funded by an increase in Ss borrowing facility with NatWest.
I also feel that its important here to confirm the remit of this service. Specially, this service 
isnt a Court of Law and doesnt operate in the manner of one. Rather, as an informal dispute 
resolution service, our remit is centred around fairness of outcome, and in this instance I do 
feel that it was fair for NatWest to have taken the close informal relationship that S had with 
The Group into consideration, and having done so that it was it was fair for NatWest to have 
made the decision to transfer Ss relationship to the GRG when it did.
S is also unhappy with the low valuation amount that was supplied by the NatWest approved 
valuer in 2014  although S have confirmed to this service that they have no complaint over 
the requirement by NatWest for an updated valuation of the property portfolio at that time.
Again, I can appreciate Ss position here, but the valuation was undertaken by a third-party 
valuer and as such the valuation amount isnt something that I would consider holding 
NatWest accountable for. As such, it seems that Ss complaint in this regard appears to rest 
with a different party, and I will not be considering this aspect of Ss complaint against 
NatWest further.
S also have concerns that NatWest became unwilling to continue providing finance to S and 
that NatWest didnt honour agreements made with The Director in this regard. But again, just 
as a company such as S can choose who they wish to accept offers of finance from, a 
business such as NatWest is also free to choose whether it will offer new finance to an 
applicant client or continue to offer finance to an existing client. 
In this instance it seems reasonable to me, given the reduced value of the property portfolio 
and other factors, that NatWest might reasonably have had a heightened perception of 
potential risk meaning that, regardless of past discussions, it was no longer willing to 
continue offering finance to S at that time.
S have also stated that it believes that NatWest levied charges relating to companies within 
The Group into its balances. However, having reviewed the information available to me I 
havent seen any evidence of this, and I note that while S have been asked previously by our 
investigator to provide further evidence in this regard, they havent done so.
Finally, Im aware that S feel that by way of the events under consideration, NatWest subjected its directors to unreasonable amounts of stress and worry for which compensation 
is merited. However, it can be the case that a degree of personal stress is inherent when 
holding the role of a company director, and given that I dont feel that NatWest can be 
considered to have acted unfairly or unreasonably towards S here, as explained above, I 
also dont feel that I can reasonably or fairly hold NatWest accountable in the manner that S 
would like.
All of which means that I find it difficult to conclude that NatWest have acted unfairly or 
unreasonably in consideration of Ss complaint, and it follows from this that I wont be 
upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action at this time.
I realise this wont be the outcome that S was wanting, but I trust it will understand, given all 
that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.    
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask S to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 April 2022.
