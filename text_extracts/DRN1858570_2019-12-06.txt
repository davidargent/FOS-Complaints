K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs Fs complaint is about  the amount of compensation  that Bank of Scotland  plc 
(BOS) has offered to settle  their complaint about  a mis-sold payment protection insurance  
(PPI) policy taken out alongside a loan.
background
Mr and Mrs F complained to BOS that they had been mis-sold PPI with a loan ending 7994.  
BOS agreed to settle their complaint and offered £4,372.82 (after  tax) in compensation.
Mr and Mrs F were  not happy  with this offer and brought their complaint to this service. They 
said the compensation wasnt refunding everything  they had paid for the PPI policy.
Our adjudicator said what BOS had worked out and offered  was fair. Mr and Mrs F didnt 
agree so asked  for an ombudsman to look at their complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The copy  of the loan agreement provided  by Mr and Mrs F shows  the loan they wanted for 
their own use was for £10,000.00 and the interest payable on that over the 36 month term of 
the loan was £1,844.84.   In addition Mr and Mrs F borrowed an extra £1,881.00 to pay for 
the cost of the PPI premium. The interest that would have been paid on the PPI premium  
over the full term of the loan was £217.65.  So Mr and Mrs F should have repaid a total of 
£13,943.52 over the full loan term for all the borrowings and interest. For the PPI the total 
cost repaid would  have  been £2,098.65 over the full loan term.
But Mr and Mrs F paid off the loan early.  I note from the calculations  Mr and Mrs F have 
provided they have  worked out that with the monthly payments they made  plus the amount 
paid on settlement they would have paid £14,020.31 for all their loan and interest. Although  
they have then removed a rebate amount of £75.59, showing the amount they say they 
actually paid when  they settled early  as £13,944.52 in total.
In fact looking at the loan account statement it shows when  Mr and Mrs F repaid  the loan 
early they overpaid  and the account was in credit by £76.79  as on 18 December 2001. But 
on 20 December 2001 there is a further entry shown on the statement that says:  Ins E/Sett 
Rebate Credit - £123.00.
This describes and shows that a credit  was applied to the loan account for an insurance 
early settlement rebate. This was a rebate on the cost of the PPI insurance premium. This 
credit brought the account into credit  by a total of £199.79 when added  to the overpayment 
by Mr and Mrs F of £76.79. On 28 December 2001  a further  rebate  of £187.53 (probably for 
interest not due because  of the early  settlement) was also applied to the loan account,  
bringing the total credit on the account  to £387.32.  This amount is shown as paid as a refund 
on 31 December 2001, so Mr and Mrs F were paid this amount back.
From the loan agreement  I can see the maximum Mr and Mrs F would ever have paid for the 
PPI was £2,098.65.  The loan statement shows clearly a rebate of £123.00 was made 
therefore the total Mr and Mrs F could have paid for the PPI was £1,975.65. I can see from 
Ref: DRN18585702the calculations  undertaken by BOS that the total compensation refunded for the premiums 
and interest on the premiums was deemed to be £2,054.85. Therefore I think  what BOS has 
calculated is slightly more  than may be due as it is only £43.80  less than the total cost of the 
PPI including  interest if the loan had run to full term. But it is clear from the statement 
provided by Mr and Mrs F that a rebate of £123.00 was made.
Compensatory interest  at 8% simple  has then been worked out on the £2,054.85  and this 
came to £2,897.47  making a total gross amount of compensation  before tax of £4,952.32. 
BOS are required  to take tax at the basic rate from the compensatory 8% simple interest 
which means the net amount due and offered was £4,372.82.
I have noted Mr and Mrs Fs calculation but this does not take into account  the overpayment  
they made on settlement and all rebates which were refunded back  to them as shown on the 
loan account statement. 
I also note Mr and Mrs F have said they paid the PPI cost upfront, but in fact that is not the 
case as they borrowed  the amount they needed for the PPI, which was added  to their loan 
and so they paid some interest on it. 
So I think what BOS has offered is fair and repays  all the costs  of the PPI that Mr and Mrs F 
paid for the PPI premium plus gives them some compensatory interest for being out of 
pocket.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained I think that what Bank  of Scotland plc has offered in 
compensation to Mr and Mrs F is fair. It repays all the costs they paid for the PPI plus 
provides compensatory interest for any periods Mr and Mrs F were out of pocket. If the 
compensation has not yet been paid Bank  of Scotland plc should update the 8% simple 
interest to the date of final payment. Otherwise  Im not telling it to do anything more.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs F to 
accept or reject my decision  before  6 January  2020.
