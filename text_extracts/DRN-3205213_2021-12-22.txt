The complaint
Ms M complains that NewDay Ltd didnt treat her fairly in how it handled the loyalty points 
she accrued through using her NewDay issued credit card affiliated to a retailers loyalty 
scheme. 
What happened
Ms M held a NewDay credit card for several years. The card was affiliated to a retail store 
which offered a loyalty scheme based on card usage. Using the card would accrue loyalty 
points and each quarter, these points would be converted into vouchers redeemable in the 
retailers stores against the purchase of items. 
In February 2020, Ms M had accrued points she expected should equate to over £400 worth 
of vouchers. But, at the end of that quarter, she only received £300. She queried this 
discrepancy with NewDay, and was told that under the current loyalty scheme terms £300 
was the maximum quarterly voucher payment.
Ms M says shed never received notification of any such change. She says shed received 
vouchers for values in excess of £300 in some previous quarters. Ms M says she had 
concerns that the retailer was in serious financial trouble and so she didnt want to wait until 
the next quarter to receive the balance of the vouchers - because if the retailer failed, any 
vouchers would lose their value. She asked NewDay for the balance now. But NewDay 
didnt agree.
A few weeks later the retailer entered administration, meaning the retailers vouchers had 
limited (if any) residual value.
Ms M was unhappy with this. She wanted NewDay to apply a credit to her account of a sum 
equivalent to the value of the vouchers shed otherwise have been entitled to. Alternatively, 
shed accept an offer of vouchers for another retailers scheme to the same value. 
NewDay declined to offer either option. It explained it was responsible for the credit card, but 
not the retailers loyalty scheme. NewDay said it only administered the loyalty scheme on 
behalf of the retailer and that the retailer was responsible for setting the terms of (and 
meeting any obligations under) the loyalty scheme agreement. It said any concerns about 
the scheme itself including the suspension of the scheme needed therefore to be directed to 
the retailer.
Ms M asked our service to consider the matter. Our investigator looked into what had 
happened. She didnt think NewDay was at fault. She said that from what she had seen, 
NewDay had administered the scheme appropriately in accordance with the scheme rules 
set by the retailer. The investigator said the loyalty scheme was the responsibility of the 
retailer including the terms and conditions that were set under the scheme as well as any 
amendments. The investigator thought this also applied to any financial obligations owed 
under the scheme. She didnt uphold the complaint.
Ms M didnt accept the investigators findings and asked for the matter to be reviewed. She 
said that when shed previously raised a query with the retailer about her credit card, shed 
been told this had to be dealt with by NewDay, not the retailer. So, she thought the contract 
must be with NewDay not the retailer. If shed been told the scheme rules had changed to 
limit the maximum quarterly reward, shed have moved cards to one offering a loyalty 
scheme for a different retailer.
In light of this disagreement, Ive been asked to review this complaint and reach a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This includes everything Ms M has submitted and the points shes raised, both initially and in 
response to the investigators opinion. Having done so, I am sorry to disappoint Ms M, but I 
have reached the same conclusions as the investigator and for broadly the same reasons.
Ive considered Ms Ms point that when shed raised queries previously with the retailer 
about her credit card, it had referred her to NewDay.
Her credit agreement was held with NewDay and anything relating to those contractual 
arrangements would therefore be the responsibility of NewDay not the retailer. Further, the 
loyalty scheme was administered on behalf of the retailer and so any queries about it would 
be handled by NewDay in the normal course of events.
Importantly though, administering the scheme did not make NewDay financially liable for any 
breach by the retailer  that liability remained with the retailer. While the retailer stopped 
trading and ceased offering the loyalty scheme, it does not follow that NewDay took on the 
liabilities of the retailer in relation to the scheme.
So while Ms M argues that NewDay should make right what shes lost in terms of the value 
of the retailers vouchers, I cannot fairly say that NewDay is liable. The value in the loyalty 
scheme points was provided by the retailer in their conversion to store vouchers. The 
retailers store vouchers only had value in terms of what could be purchased from the 
retailer. When the retailer closed its stores and entered administration, the holder of a 
voucher might have some claim as a creditor against the retailer if there was any residual 
value in those vouchers. But that would be the extent of it.
Similarly, I do not find NewDay liable for setting or amending the retailers loyalty scheme 
rules. Any contract Ms M held in relation to those terms and conditions would have been with 
the retailer. And any breach, acts or omissions in relation to those rules were matters for 
which the retailer would ultimately bear responsibility. I simply cant fairly hold NewDay 
responsible for any consequences Ms M has borne or more specifically her losses in terms 
of the value of the vouchers shed otherwise rightfully earned. NewDays role here was 
simply to run the scheme on the retailers behalf, but the scheme was ultimately the retailers 
not NewDays.
As I said above, I am sorry to disappoint Ms M. But I dont find NewDay responsible to 
compensate her for the vouchers the retailers scheme would have entitled her to had the 
retailer not entered administration. Neither do I find it liable to compensate Ms M for the loss 
in value of the vouchers she did receive. Any such liabilities sat with the retailer not NewDay.
My final decisionFor the reasons given above, I do not uphold Ms Ms complaint about NewDay Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 January 2022.
