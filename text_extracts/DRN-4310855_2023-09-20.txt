The complaint
Mr O complains that ClearBank Limited didnt do enough to prevent the loss he suffered 
when he sent money to one of their customers as the result of a scam.
What happened
The detailed background to this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide 
a brief overview of some of the key events here. In October 2022 Mr O was sadly the victim 
of a scam. A scammer tricked him into sending a payment for £2,900 from his account with 
W to an account held with ClearBank. At the time Mr O believed he was making a booking 
on a well-known website.
Once he realised hed been a victim of a scam, Mr O reported this to W and ClearBank. 
Complaints were also made about both banks. A complaint about Ws actions has already 
been considered by one of my Ombudsman colleagues. She upheld the complaint in part 
and directed W to pay Mr O £4.49 (plus interest). This still leaves Mr O with the majority of 
his loss which he is seeking to recover from ClearBank.
One of our Investigators considered the complaint but didnt recommend it should be upheld. 
In summary he didnt think there were failures by ClearBank in relation to the outstanding 
loss. 
Mr O disagrees and has asked for an Ombudsman to review his complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im satisfied that ClearBank correctly followed their account opening process for the account 
that received money from Mr O. I dont think there was anything at that stage that would 
have indicated that the account might later be used in connection with a fraud or scam. So, I 
dont think ClearBank could have prevented Mr Os loss in relation to the opening of the 
account.
Ive also considered the activity prior to Mr Os payment crediting the account, its arrival and 
how these funds were spent. But Im not persuaded that any of the activity ought to have 
alerted ClearBank to the possibility of fraud. Im satisfied none of the account activity ought 
to have stood out to ClearBank as so unusual or suspicious such that they ought to have 
done more. So, in relation to Mr Os outstanding loss, I dont think there have been any 
failings by ClearBank regarding the monitoring of the recipient account, so I cant say they 
missed an opportunity to prevent Mr Os loss in this way.
Im also satisfied that ClearBank took appropriate action in relation to the recipient account 
upon being notified that Mr Os payment was as the result of a scam. And the funds from the 
payment that represents Mr Os outstanding loss were spent very soon after they were 
received and before ClearBank knew or reasonably could have known they were the 
proceeds of a scam. So, I dont think ClearBank did anything which negatively impacted the 
chances of a successful recovery. 
I appreciate Mr O has also asked ClearBank to share details of the accountholder with him 
so he can take this to the police. Hes also asked our service to confirm the details for who 
he believes received the payment. Unfortunately, data protection laws prevent both 
ClearBank and our service sharing this information with Mr O. However, Im confident that a 
regulated business such as ClearBank will share information with the police upon a request 
from them to do so. 
Im sorry to hear Mr O lost money to a scammer. But as I dont think ClearBank are 
responsible for anything that caused the loss or hindered its recovery, there isnt a 
reasonable basis upon which I can direct them to do more to resolve this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 October 2023.
