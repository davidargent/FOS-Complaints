K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that Tesco Personal Finance PLC charged him interest when  they shouldnt  
have. He would like this interest refunded and a payment for the distress  and inconvenience  
suffered because of the interest  being  charged. 
background
Mr C had a credit card with Tesco. His payments were usually made  by direct debit.
Mr Cs statement dated 16 June 2018  requested a payment of £6,633.79 by 6 July 2018.  
Mr C says that online statement showed that he needed to pay £5,220.00. 
On 28 June 2018, Mr C made a manual  faster payment  of £5220.00 to clear  what he thought  
was his balance.  
Although Mr C had paid £5220, the direct  debit was still due to collect £6,633.79 on or 
around the 1 July 2018. Mr Cs paying bank asked  for the direct debit to be cancelled but the 
request was made after the paying  bank had already authorised  it. So, Tesco  collected  the 
£6,633.79. Mr C raised an indemnity claim to have it paid back and this was successful. 
But this left Mr C with a balance of around  £1,500  that was left unpaid. Mr C was charged 
interest of £75.90  in his July 2018 statement. The balance was cleared  on 3 August  2018.
Mr C called Tesco in August 2018 to find out why hed been charged interest. A complaint 
was raised as he was told that the interest had been correctly  applied. 
In Tescos final response letter, they found that they hadnt made  a mistake in applying  the 
interest. As a gesture  of goodwill,  they offered Mr C a payment of £15 and also agreed to 
refund the interest charged  in the August statement. 
Mr C wasnt happy with this outcome so he came to us. 
Our adjudicator investigated the complaint. He found that there  hadnt  been a banking  error 
and that Tesco had applied the interest correctly. He found that Tesco  had acted fairly and 
reasonably in offering to pay £15 and to refund the interest for the August  2018 statement. 
Mr C didnt accept this decision so it has now come to me.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im afraid that Mr C wont  be happy with my decision. I think  that Tesco  has been fair and 
reasonable in this case. I will explain  why. 
I can see that Mr C believed  that his balance was £5220 for June 2018. I also note that both 
he and Tesco agree that he was a prompt payer in months previous to June 2018. But, the 
fact remains that the balance  that needed  to be paid off was £6,633.79 and not £5220.  
Ref: DRN33364162Even though  the online account  might  have stated the balance  incorrectly,  Mr C still had the 
statement dated 16 June  2018 so he wouldve been aware that the balance  was £6,633.79. 
So, I cant fault Tesco as they had told Mr C what the balance was. 
Mr C says that he made the payment  twice. But, it was his paying  bank and his raised 
indemnity claim that resulted in the direct debit  payment being  taken  back by his paying 
bank. So, I find again that I cant hold Tesco responsible  for this. 
Although it might be considered that Tesco shouldve kept part of the direct debit payment to 
clear the balance, it wasnt for them to do this as the entire direct debit had been cancelled.  I 
think that they were  right to return the full amount received in via the direct  debit.  
So, as there  was a shortfall in the payment, this did leave a balance  of around £1,500. Tesco 
acted within  their terms and conditions in applying the interest.  I dont think that they acted 
unfairly or unreasonably in doing  this. 
I am sorry  that this isnt the outcome that Mr C wanted but I find that Tescos payment of £15 
and the refund of the August interest  is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. So, I wont 
be asking them to do anything else.  
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I wont be asking Tesco  Personal  Finance PLC to do anything 
else. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 July 2019.
