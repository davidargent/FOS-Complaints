The complaint
Mr B complains that he was allowed to set up an account with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie
SCA even though he was underage. And he also complains that a payment then made to
him through PayPal was never received.
Mr B has been supported in bringing this complaint by his father.   
What happened
Mr Bs father said that his son was allowed to set up a PayPal account without any age
verification. He was younger than 18 at the time.
Mr Bs father told us that Mr B then sold an item through an online auction site, asking for
payment through PayPal. Mr Bs father said Mr B was told payment had been received, but
this turned out not to be the case.
Mr Bs father said hed complained about this to PayPal, and received no response.
PayPal said that Mr B opened an account with it on 6 April 2019. PayPal said that it is clear
someone has to be 18 or over to open an account with it. And Mr B had told it that he was
born in 2000, meaning he would now be 21. PayPal said that it had no reason to think that
Mr B was underage when he opened his account.
PayPal said that Mr Bs father complained to it in summer 2021, and on 24 August Mr Bs
account was limited, on suspicion that the account holder may be underage. PayPal said the
account would remain limited until it got valid photo ID for Mr B. And if that ID confirmed Mr
B was under 18, the account would be closed.
PayPal said it could see that a payment of £122 was made to an email address which
apparently belongs to Mr B. This was for the sale of an item on an online auction site. But
this email address wasnt the same as the one Mr B had previously registered with PayPal.
So PayPal said it had emailed this address, to say that the owner of the address needed to
register it with PayPal, in order to access the money that had been sent.
PayPal said the address wasnt registered with it, and around a week later, the sender took
the payment back. PayPal said that the email address was finally registered with it two days
after this happened.
PayPal said it wouldnt advise a seller to send an item until they have received the money in
their account. This never happened in this case. So PayPal said Mr B could ask the buyer to
pay him, but it couldnt help him.
PayPal said it understood Mr B and his father remained very disappointed, but PayPal didnt
think it had done anything wrong.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said PayPal didnt have to
ask for ID when Mr B opened an account, and PayPal had no reason to doubt what Mr B told
it about how old he was. And Mr B didnt get the payment for the item he sold because that
payment wasnt sent to an email address registered with PayPal. Our investigator thought
PayPal had followed its own terms and conditions, and he said it didnt have to do any more.
Mr Bs father didnt agree. He said that PayPal should've done more checks to verify the age
of Mr B when the account was opened. And even if PayPal doesnt do that, Mr B shouldn't
be responsible for his actions because he's a minor.
Mr B also said that the link PayPal sent to Mr B to allow him to verify his email address was
broken. Mr B hadnt contacted PayPal about that.
Mr B wanted to know why the money was returned to the buyer. Our investigator explained
that the buyer, who sent the money, had asked for the payment to be refunded. The money
hed sent hadnt actually been paid to anyone, so the sender was able to ask for it back, and
in these circumstances PayPal will pay it back. Our investigator noted that sellers dont
usually send items until theyve received the payment.
Because no agreement was reached, this case was passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I only proposed to 
uphold it in part. This is what I said then: 
When I decide a case, I dont just look at the underlying law. My overriding duty is to 
consider whats fair and reasonable. And, although I know that Mr B and his father 
will be disappointed by this, I dont think that what has gone wrong here is entirely 
PayPals fault. So I dont think it has to pay Mr B all the money he has lost. But there 
is one point in this case where I dont think PayPal has been fair, and I will ask it to 
pay some compensation because of that. Ill explain why I think that.
PayPal asked Mr B his age when he opened an account. I know Mr Bs father thinks 
PayPal shouldve taken steps to check Mr Bs age. But I think its reasonable for 
PayPal to rely on what Mr B said when he made his application. It didnt have any 
reason to think he wasnt telling the truth. So I dont think it was wrong for PayPal to 
open an account for Mr B in 2019.
Mr B then sold an item on an online auction site. He asked for payment to a specified 
email address. PayPal has shown us that this address wasnt the one Mr B had 
already registered with it. So it contacted this email address, and said a payment had 
been sent there.
But PayPal also allows a sender to reclaim a payment, if its been sent to an 
unregistered email address, and hasnt been paid into someones account. And here, 
the buyer reclaimed this money before Mr B tried to link the second email address to 
his existing account.
I dont think its PayPals fault that Mr B used an email address that he hadnt 
previously registered with PayPal, when he sold this item. But I do think theres 
something that PayPal did wrong here. Thats because I cant see, in the email that 
Mr B was sent to tell him a payment had been made to the unregistered email 
address, that there was any suggestion that this payment could be recalled. The 
email is titled notification of payment and it begins Youve received new funds!.So I think that Mr B wasnt warned, when he was told about the payment and 
presumably before he sent this item, that he hadnt actually got the money. And, 
most importantly, it doesnt look as if Mr B was warned that the buyer could ask for 
the money back. I dont think thats fair. And because Mr B wasnt warned that this 
payment could be reversed, I think PayPal should pay Mr B £50 in compensation 
now.
I know that this is rather less than Mr B lost. And I know that Mr Bs father considers 
that whats gone wrong here is because of Mr Bs age. I note the argument that Mr 
Bs father makes about his sons capacity to enter into a legally binding agreement. 
He thinks that Mr B is being held responsible for things he has done, although he is a 
minor.
I havent seen anything to suggest that formal action will be taken against Mr B. But I 
do have to take into account everything that has happened in this case. That includes 
that Mr B opened an account at a point when he wasnt entitled to do so, and so 
there was no legally binding agreement between him and PayPal at the time this 
payment was made, as well as that the email address used for this payment wasnt 
linked to Mr Bs account. Because of that, I also dont think it would be fair and 
reasonable to ask PayPal to reimburse the full amount that has been lost on this 
sale.
So I currently propose to ask PayPal to pay Mr B £50.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both sides replied.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Bs father thanked me for looking into this complaint. He said he still found it worrying that 
a minor can set up an account with PayPal and link their banking details with no financial 
guarantee. He said if I thought PayPal had done all it needed to do, then he and Mr B would 
accept that. They would also gladly accept the payment of £50, even though it didnt fully 
address their concerns.
Mr Bs father said that he wanted to raise his wider concerns about financial regulations 
governing online childrens accounts, and he would take this forward separately. 
I understand the wider concerns that Mr Bs father has raised in this case. But our service 
isnt a regulator, and Im only able to look at what happened in this case. So my decision is 
based on these specific circumstances. 
And here, it does seem to me that the main impetus for this complaint was that Mr B hadnt 
received payment for an item he sold. I appreciate that Mr Bs age is an important part of the 
context of this complaint, and I understand that Mr Bs father is concerned that his son was 
ever able to open the PayPal account. But I dont think that this problem occurred solely 
because of Mr Bs age, or because hed been able to open an account although under 18. I 
think that this problem occurred mainly because when PayPal wrote to Mr B to say hed 
received a payment, it didnt also tell him that he needed to act urgently, or this payment 
could be recalled. Thats why I told PayPal it did need to pay Mr B some compensation.PayPal also replied. It said that it appreciated my comments about the email it had sent Mr 
B, but it wanted to draw my attention to the part of that email which said Mr B would need to 
click on the link provided and complete the required registration form in order to claim his 
funds.
And PayPal said it stands to reason that a customer would want to log into their account to 
confirm they had actually received their funds before shipping an item. PayPal said Mr B 
hadnt done that. 
PayPal said that if Mr B could provide evidence that he did ship the item to the buyer without 
checking that he had received payment, then it would pay a courtesy credit of £50 GBP, as a 
gesture of goodwill. But if Mr B couldnt prove that he had sent the item, PayPal said it would 
argue that this entire issue arose as a result of Mr Bs own negligence and that he had not 
lost out financially as a result.
PayPal repeated that it is imperative that all sellers log into their account to confirm that 
payment has been received, prior to shipping an item.
I noted in my provisional decision that the email PayPal sent Mr B was titled notification of 
payment and it begins Youve received new funds! I think thats a clear statement from 
PayPal, and I also think PayPal ought reasonably to have realised that some of its 
customers would rely on this email, to say that their money had arrived. I dont think I can 
accept PayPals general argument in this case, which seems to be that it isnt reasonable for 
its customers to simply rely on what PayPal itself has said to them.
I know PayPal also said Mr B had to take steps to register this email address, but I stressed 
in my provisional decision that it didnt warn him about the urgency of this, or alert him to any 
risks in not taking this step immediately. 
PayPal has also suggested that theres no hard evidence that Mr B ever sent this item. But 
Mr B has shown our service confirmation from the relevant auction site that the item was 
sent, and that it was also successfully delivered. Ive accepted this. I dont think further 
evidence on this point is required here. 
For the reasons Ive set out above, I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the award I 
originally proposed.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must pay Mr B £50.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 January 2022.
