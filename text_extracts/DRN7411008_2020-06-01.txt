K821x#15complaint
Mr B says S.D. Taylor  Limited trading as Loans at Home (LAH) lent to him irresponsibly. 
Mr B complains that he is a vulnerable consumer. He says that Loans  at Home still lent to 
him despite it being clear that he was unlikely to be able to understand the contracts or 
afford the loan repayments.  
background
This complaint is about 37 home  collected credit loans LAH provided to Mr B between June 
2007 and October  2017. Ive attached a table at the end of this decision that shows  some  of 
the information LAH has provided about  this lending. 
Loans 1 to 14 were  taken  more than six years before  Mr B made his complaint. And he has 
agreed that this Service shouldnt  consider them. Also,  because  of the time that has passed,  
LAH has limited information about  this lending. So Im only looking at loans 15 to 37. These 
were numbered loans  1 to 23 in the adjudicators opinion. 
As part of its complaint  investigation LAH upheld  Mr Bs complaint about loans 15 - 21 (loans  
1 to 7 in the adjudicators  letter). Ive noted the correspondence surrounding this offer but 
ultimately Mr B didnt properly accept  it and the compensation hasnt been paid. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that LAH shouldnt have approved 
loans 15 to 37 as the lending pattern itself had become harmful  at this point. S.D. Taylor 
didnt agree with this and so the complaint  has been  passed to me to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  high cost credit - including all of the relevant  rules,  guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
LAH needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr B could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that LAH should fairly and reasonably  have done  
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN74110082refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Bs complaint 
(in part) and have  explained why below.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 15 to 37 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of LAHs  lending 
history with Mr B, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which  LAH should reasonably  
have seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  And so LAH should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Bs case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
15. I say this because:
at this point LAH ought to have realised Mr B was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr B had already been  indebted to LAH for around five years.  So LAH 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr B was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole making the previous repayments had left in his finances and that 
Mr Bs indebtedness was unsustainable;
over this lending  Mr B was typically provided with a new loan to repay  the balance of 
an outstanding  one. So further to this, at this point, LAH ought  to have known that 
Mr B was not likely  borrowing to meet an ongoing,  long term, need;
and because of these factors above  Mr B didnt make any real inroads to the amount 
he owed LAH. Loan 37 was taken out over 10 years after Mr Bs first. And it was for a 
larger amount. Mr B had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to 
LAH over an extended period. And this was a very long time to use high cost credit. 
I think that Mr B lost out because LAH continued  to provide borrowing from loan 15 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Bs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time;
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr B borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Bs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 15 to 37 and LAH should  put things right.
Ref: DRN74110083putting things right  what LAH needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr B paid on loans 15 to 37;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 15 onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 15 to 37 should be removed from 
Mr Bs credit file.
If Mr B still owes LAH any of the principal balance he borrowed on loans 35 to 37, instead of 
the above for these loans, LAH should  remove all the interest and charges applied to the 
outstanding balance. LAH should then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Mr B 
went to towards the principal. But importantly, LAH needs to make sure that Mr B doesnt 
repay more  than the principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Mr B hasnt repaid the principal he borrowed LAH can deduct this from the 
remainder of the compensation. If, Mr B has already  paid enough to repay the principal then 
any overpayment should be refunded  to him with 8% simple* interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement
And if LAH no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Mr B.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to take off tax from this interest. LAH must  give Mr B 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Bs complaint.
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things  right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 July 2020.
