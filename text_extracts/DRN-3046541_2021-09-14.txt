The complaint
Miss R has raised a number of complaint points about PayPal (Europe) Sarl & Cie, SCA
(PayPal). The complaints relate to payment disputes on her account, repayment of a
Working Capital Loan, and how shes been treated by staff.
What happened
It has been difficult for this service to get a clear idea of the specifics of Miss Rs complaint
against PayPal. We have asked for clarity a few times, but Miss R hasnt given us any real
detail or evidence to help establish the basis of her complaints. 
And so it is difficult to summarise here what the key issues are. Its equally been difficult to 
then investigate her concerns and provide an answer. Ive considered historic contact Miss R 
has had with this service and PayPal in an attempt to draw together what appear to be the 
key issues.
I issued a Provisional Decision for Miss Rs complaint setting out my understanding as best I 
could and asking her to provide any further comments or evidence. She did reply, but only to 
comment on how she felt our investigator had handled the case. There was no further detail 
as to what her specific complaint with PayPal was and nor was any further evidence given.
Thats meant my Final Decision closely mirrors the Provisional Decision.
Payment disputes on the account
Miss R has said that PayPal has unfairly allowed an online auction company (that Ill refer to
as E) to debit funds from her account. She says E has acted unfairly, that scammers are
involved, and that PayPal and E are trying to steal her money for criminal purposes.
Miss R has said E has banned her due to PayPal which means shes lost her small
business.
Miss R has also had a dispute involving a merchant where £226.80 was debited from her
PayPal account. The related purchase was cancelled, with the merchant refunding the
money. But it took several days for Miss Rs refund to be fully processed.
Repayment of a Working Capital Loan
Miss R took a Working Capital Loan with PayPal in April 2019. She had cause to take a
repayment holiday and has said that PayPal continued to chase her for payment. Miss R has
said it continued to chase her even after shed repaid the loan.
Miss R was mistreated by PayPal staff
Miss R has said a number of different things about how shes been treated by staff. She
says this treatment has come on the back of the issues Ive described above. Shes said at
different times that PayPal and its staff have:
overcharged her for its third-rate customer service;
they steal money;
they tell lies;
they send death threats to her saying that she must either pay PayPal £50,000 or itll
send people to steal her possessions;
they sold her details to companies and people outside UK to get money for drugs.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im not upholding Miss Rs complaint. Ill explain why. The following findings are the same as 
those already set out in my Provisional Decision. As Miss R has provided no further detail to 
her complaint, or evidence to support it, I can see no reason that the findings should change.
Ive looked back over correspondence between Miss R and PayPal, as well as our service,
in an attempt to pin down the key complaint points. It is the case that Miss Rs contact with
us has been limited in terms of providing clarity on what the nature of her complaint is.
Having been over everything I have to date, I cant see that PayPal has acted unfairly or
unreasonably and so I dont intend to uphold the complaint.
Payment disputes on the account
Miss R hasnt identified any specific transactions on her PayPal account that she disputes.
Shes stated various amounts at different points in the complaint journey. But Ive not been
able to identify any matching transactions on her PayPal history. The common theme
identified by Miss R is that it is E that has unfairly claimed money from PayPal. And that is
what Miss R seems to have told PayPal at various times too.
I can see there have been payment reversals, refunds, and other charges on Miss Rs
account, with the money going to E or people that seem to have been buying through E,
from Miss R. But it seems all of the payments and charges that might be the subject of
Miss Rs complaint are caught by Miss Rs agreement with E, as a seller, to allow it to debit
her PayPal account. That doesnt mean that it can do so without reason, but it seems to me
any dispute Miss R has here is with E and not PayPal. Those disputes might relate to
charitable donations collected when buying/selling on E, or to do with buyer/seller disputes
for particular items Miss R has bought or sold. Ive not seen anything that suggests PayPal
has unfairly, or without authority, debited her PayPal account.
I can see from Miss Rs contact with PayPal that she did have a dispute with a particular
merchant and a payment of £226.80. This seems to be unrelated to E and, from what I can
tell, looks to have been for the purchase of an online service that Miss R didnt want to go
ahead with, whatever the reason may have been. I can see the merchant refunded Miss R
after shed made a payment through PayPal. But because of the way the transaction works,
PayPal paid the merchant first and then looked to claim the money from Miss Rs bank
account. That is the way such payments normally work, with PayPal essentially providing the
funds upfront. The merchant refunded Miss R before the money from her bank account
reached PayPal. And there were several days where the payment from Miss Rs bank
account to PayPal, and back again, was pending. That meant the funds were inaccessible toMiss R.
I can see Miss R repeatedly contacted PayPal about this issue. She said she was short of
funds. I can see PayPal promptly responded and explained the situation along with the 
timescales. I can also see Miss R wasnt satisfied with its response and PayPal paid her £50
in compensation as a gesture of goodwill.
Miss R then, at different times, said that she didnt accept PayPals offer and that it hadnt
given her the £50. In terms of whether such an offer was fair, I cant see that PayPal made a
mistake and the £50 was solely a gesture of goodwill. And so I cant say PayPal ought to
have done anything more. And in terms of whether PayPal did actually pay the £50 to Miss
R, its clear it did. Ive seen evidence that satisfies me the £50 was credited to Miss Rs
account and then withdrawn by her.
Repayment of a Working Capital Loan (WCL)
I can see Miss R discussed the WCL with PayPal on a number of occasions. She was often
in contact about repayments. And I can see she wanted to make sure PayPal understood
her circumstances at different times. I think Miss R did the right thing by being open and
honest with PayPal about her financial situation and what she could afford to pay.
There were times when Miss R seems to have been short of funds and so she asked for a
payment holiday. From the evidence Ive seen Miss R was never denied a payment holiday.
PayPal look to have been open and flexible, allowing Miss R to take breaks from repaying
the WCL.
I understand the WCL is now fully repaid and theres no balance outstanding.
Miss R has complained that PayPal kept chasing her for payment. Shes said she was
repeatedly threatened with violence and was told that her possessions would be taken. But
PayPal has said it wasnt chasing Miss R for repayment of the WCL at all.
Ive seen no evidence to suggest PayPal was chasing Miss R for repayment. Any time she
contacted PayPal about the WCL it either confirmed it was happy with repayment
arrangements or was willing to allow payment holidays to continue. Ive seen nothing that
suggests it was pressuring Miss R for repayment. And I find it highly unlikely any business
that is subject to regulation would threaten a customer with violence or other criminal activity.
Miss R was mistreated by PayPal staff
Much of what Miss R has said she is unhappy about, in respect of this part of the complaint,
relates to the two areas Ive already discussed. Ive been through a lot of correspondence
between PayPal and Miss R and have found no evidence to suggest it mistreated her, either
generally or in respect of the specific points shes raised. Theres no evidence to suggest
otherwise and, as Ive said above, I find its highly unlikely the majority of Miss Rs
allegations are true.
I can see that PayPal staff have shown a great deal of resilience and tolerance in the face of
offensive language, opinions, and comments from Miss R. The evidence shows what
appears to have been genuine efforts by PayPal staff to help her through her various
complaint, despite her hostile behaviour.
Conclusion
Ive explained how its been difficult to properly determine the specifics of Miss Rs complaint
points. And so Ive undertaken a broad summary review of the activity and correspondenceon her account. Having done so, I cant see that PayPal has treated her unfairly and so I
dont intend to make any award to Miss R.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 October 2021.
