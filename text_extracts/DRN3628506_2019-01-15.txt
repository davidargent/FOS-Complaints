K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs B complain  National Westminster Bank  Plc keeps declining  debit card payments 
they make  to pay money into a savings account  with another business.  
background
Mr and Mrs B have  a NatWest current account  and make regular payments to a savings 
account they have with another  business. In 2018  debit card payments to the other business 
began to be returned to NatWest. While some  payments have gone through,  numerous  
payments have been returned. 
Mr and Mrs B have  complained to both NatWest and the other business. Both organisations 
claim theres  no error and that the other  is responsible for the payments being returned  to 
Mr and Mrs Bs current account. 
Mr and Mrs B complained to NatWest  but it didnt agree  it had made a mistake  as its not 
declined any payments to the third party business.  Unhappy  with the response,  
Mr and Mrs B referred their complaint to this service and an investigator looked at whats  
happened. 
The investigator looked at the information  provided  by NatWest and didnt find any evidence  
it had declined Mr and Mrs Bs transactions so didnt uphold  their complaint. Mr and Mrs B 
have asked to appeal so the complaints been passed to me to make a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate how frustrating it must be to have both businesses involved blaming the other 
and I can understand  why Mr and Mrs B remain dissatisfied that theyve  not been told why 
their payments arent  reliably going through. But in this decision, Im only looking at the 
actions of NatWest. 
Like the investigator, Ive paid careful  attention  to the systems  information NatWest has 
supplied. And I can see the investigators forwarded  information provided by NatWest  during 
the course of his investigation to Mr and Mrs B. Looking at the systems evidence,  Ive not 
seen anything to show NatWest declined any of Mr and Mrs Bs transactions. The 
information Ive seen shows each time they tried to make a payment the request was 
approved by NatWest.
The information also shows that when the transactions have been attempted  theyve been 
reversed which means they didnt go through.   From the evidence  available, Im satisfied 
NatWest hasnt declined  the payment requests Mr and Mrs B made. 
NatWest has confirmed  theres no blocks on Mr and Mrs Bs accounts  and the reversed 
transactions werent held for additional checks or because theres been a concern  about 
fraud. In short, NatWest says it doesnt  know why the payments are being returned. And 
from what Ive seen,  Im satisfied thats the case here.
Ref: DRN36285062I think its reasonable to note that some transactions  are successful  so I think  its established 
that NatWest is able to make these payments on Mr and Mrs Bs behalf.  And theres nothing  
in the systems evidence  that shows the reversed transactions were treated any differently 
from the approved  ones.  Unfortunately, Ive been  unable to find a specific  reason why 
Mr and Mrs Bs payments arent reliably going through.  
Taking everything into account,  Ive not seen  anything to show  NatWest is responsible for 
these payments being reversed. I know this will come as a disappointment to Mr and Mrs B 
who want to find a solution to the problem, but as Ive not found NatWest made a mistake  
Im not upholding their complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  Under the rules of the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs B to accept or reject my 
decision before  15 February 2019.
