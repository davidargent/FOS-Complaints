K822xcomplaint
Ms M has complained about short-term loans granted to her by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid. Ms M says she couldnt  afford these loans and that QuickQuid didnt 
take appropriate steps to check whether she could afford them when she took them out.
background 
QuickQuid agreed two short-term loans for Ms M between April 2013 and May 2013.  The 
loans were repayable  over between two and three months. Ive set out a summary of lending 
below.

One of our adjudicators has looked into Ms Ms complaint already and recommended the 
complaint be upheld. He felt the checks QuickQuid carried out on both loans  were  not 
proportionate. And he thought that had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks, it 
wouldve seen that both of these loans  wouldve  been unaffordable for Ms M and wouldnt 
have agreed to them.
QuickQuid has now accepted that it shouldnt  have approved these loans, and has agreed  to 
refund all of the interest and charges Ms M paid on them, as well as remove  any adverse  
information relating  to these loans from her credit  file. 
Ms M disagreed with the findings. As she felt that QuickQuid should  not only return  all of the 
interest and charges across both loans, but that it should also write-off the outstanding 
capital that remained  owing on loan 2. 
So as no agreements been reached  at this stage, the case has come to me, as an 
ombudsman, for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time.  
In cases where we think, or a business  agrees, that it was wrong  in approving  a customers  
application, wed usually  direct the business  to refund the interest  and charges the customer 
paid on those loans,  as these are costs  they wouldnt have incurred, had the loan not been 
granted. Wed  then usually direct the business to pay interest on that refund, and remove 
any adverse information  about those loans from the customers credit file. 
Ref: DRN25322232But while the customer wouldnt  have had to pay the interest  and charges they did, they also 
wouldnt have been in receipt  of the capital sum borrowed, which  essentially needs  to be 
returned. Because of this, we allow the business  to deduct from this refund, any outstanding 
capital balance that remained unpaid, to try and put the customer back in the position they 
wouldve been, had the loan not been agreed. 
If after doing so, a capital balance remained outstanding, wed expect  the business to work 
with the customer  to agree a repayment  plan to settle the outstanding  amount owed. 
Looking at the offer made by QuickQuid, it seems to have agreed to do all of the above in 
settlement of Ms Ms complaint. So in the circumstances, I think  its offer is fair and 
reasonable, and Im not recommending that it do any more in respect  of this complaint. 
my findings
For the reasons  outlined  above, I think QuickQuid should:
refund the interest and charges paid for the loan it agreed  in April 2013
pay interest on these  refunds at 8% simple from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement
remove any adverse  information about this loan from Ms Ms credit file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Ms M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
QuickQuid should  also:
remove all interest and charges added to loan 2 agreed in May 2013  from the outset. I 
understand this will leave  an outstanding balance, so QuickQuid can deduct this balance  
from what it now needs to pay Ms M above, if it still owns the debt.
If, after all of the above has been actioned, anything remains  outstanding,  a mutually 
agreeable repayment plan should  be arranged. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Ms Ms complaint. 
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2019.
