The complaint 
Ms Ms complaint is about being charged for a service when she extended a car lease she 
was financing through an agreement with Mercedes Benz Financial Services UK Limited 
(MBFS).
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Ms M acquired her car under a hire purchase agreement. The hire purchase
agreement is a regulated consumer credit agreement and as a result our service is
able to look into complaints about it.
The car was returned 68 days after the service was due and in those circumstances
Ms M is responsible for paying for the service as the contract requires her to service
the car in accordance with the manufacturers service schedule.
Ms M has explained that the reason she needed to extend the lease was because
she was in hospital. So, I understand that there are some exceptional circumstances
here that MBFS could have taken in to consideration. But they didnt have to do that,
and it would not be fair for me to suggest theyve therefore been unreasonable when
charging for the service that was due.
Ms M is also concerned that MBFS didnt advise her a service would be due and
would need to be paid for. But I dont think the terms of the contract changed, and
under those terms Ms M was always responsible for servicing the car.
For these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about Mercedes Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2020.
