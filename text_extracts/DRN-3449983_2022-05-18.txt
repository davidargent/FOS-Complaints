The complaint
A, a limited company, complains about the process for updating its busines profile with 
National Westminster Bank Plc and which led to its bank account being frozen.
What happened
NatWest asked A to provide information about its business structure as part of a due 
diligence exercise to know its customers. A thought it had already provided this in 2021. And 
a member of staff from NatWest had incorrectly told A that it had provided the required 
documents. Instead A received a further request for information and within two days the 
account had been frozen. This meant that customers couldnt send payments and the 
business was affected.
A said that NatWest had acted in an arrogant way. This time NatWest had paid A £300 in 
compensation but when it had complained about a similar issue where it hadnt experienced 
the same level of inconvenience it had been paid more.
NatWest accepted that there had been internal miscommunication leading to A being 
incorrectly told that it didnt need to take any further action. It said it had applied a restriction 
on 27 January 2022. When A complained it removed the restriction which it said would 
happen by 9 February 2022. It paid A £300 and said that if there were further specific costs 
involved it would consider these. It said that the information remained outstanding and that if 
this wasnt received a further restriction would be placed on the account in 30 days. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that NatWest do anything further about this complaint 
which it had addressed in a final response dated 8 February 2022. He said that the 
information he had was that A had been paid £150, not £500 for issues last year. He noted 
that A had provided copies of further letters from NatWest stating that the information was 
outstanding, and the account would be frozen. He said that A would need to contact 
NatWest about addressing that and complain again if it still felt it was being dealt with 
unreasonably.
A didnt agree. Its representative said it was the role of this service to look at whether 
NatWest had failed, and wed not done this. Its issue was about the manner in which 
NatWest had approached things: not about the need for due diligence. A said it didnt think 
our investigator had even read the further letters received from NatWest. It appreciated we 
arent an intermediary but expected us to look at the fact it had tried to contact NatWest. It 
wanted clarity about whether it now needed to take any action or not.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We provide informal dispute resolution. And we would look at complaint issues that have 
been referred to us following a final response letter  as here from NatWest. I appreciate that 
as far as A is concerned this matter is ongoing and it wants us to help resolve that. It has 
received further letters which Ive read saying that there are outstanding requirements and 
the account would be frozen if they arent met. A says that this hasnt happened, and it 
hasnt been given a response from NatWest. 
But Im afraid that as our investigators explained its not reasonably our role to act as an 
intermediary in dealing with ongoing issues like this. And given the past miscommunication 
within NatWest I think that any confirmation of the current position should safely come from 
NatWest itself rather than through a third party. NatWest has provided a contact point for its 
business profile team and if A remains dissatisfied with the service and approach since the 
last final response it would need to raise another complaint with NatWest first before 
referring this to us. I can understand the frustration of those at A dealing with this but Im 
afraid that this is the appropriate and fair way wed look at things here.
With regard to this complaint referred to us in the final response letter of 8 February 2022 
NatWest has accepted that A was given incorrect information about the requirements. And 
so, A didnt have the opportunity to provide any more information before its account was 
frozen. Whether or not those requirements are met is a matter for NatWest to determine. But 
its accepted a communication failing here which has inconvenienced A. It paid £300. I know 
A wants more and has referred to being offered £500 before. I can see it was paid £150 on 7 
October 2021. But Im only looking at what happened here and forming my own judgement. 
I consider that £300 is a reasonable amount taking into account our published guidelines 
and what A has said. And so, I wont be asking NatWest to pay anything more for the 
specific issues covered in its final response letter of 8 February 2022.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint in the sense that National Westminster 
Bank Plc need do no more that it has already.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask A to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 June 2022.
