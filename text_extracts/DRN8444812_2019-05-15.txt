K820x#14complaint
Mrs W and the estate  of her late husband  complain that HSBC  Bank  Plc declined to raise  a 
chargeback dispute  about  a number of debit card payments they made  to some timeshare 
companies.
background
Mr W made a number  of payments to different timeshare companies between  2008 and 
2015. Most of these  payments were made  using  his debit card on a joint account he held 
with his wife. Some  payments  were made  with a debit card for another account,  and a 
couple were made by bank transfer.
In November 2016 Mr W asked HSBC to raise  chargeback disputes  about these payments, 
because he said he had never received the services  he had paid for. He said the timeshare 
companies were fraudulent, and he provided links to websites supporting his case. He also 
said the timeshare  companies had never told him about the 14 day cooling-off period, and 
had taken his payments  during that period.
HSBC declined to raise any chargebacks. It said that all of the payments had been made 
more than 120 days earlier, being  the usual time limit for Visa chargeback  disputes. So Mr 
and Mrs W complained to our Service.
Our adjudicator did not uphold this complaint. He agreed with HSBC that the chargebacks  
had been raised  too late under the 120 days deadline. He also referred to another time limit 
of 540 days, which is for cases where it is not immediately  obvious that a chargeback reason 
applies. He said that most  of the payments had still been made too long ago to come within 
this time limit. There  had been one payment in October 2015 which was less than 540 days 
before November 2016, but he thought that if a chargeback had been raised then it would  
have failed, because  Mr W had got what he had paid for: registration with the company. 
Mr and Mrs W asked  for an ombudsmans decision. They said they had been victims of 
fraud, and the Financial  Ombudsman Service should help them instead of repeating the 
arguments used  by the bank. That was in late 2017.
Unfortunately, the case was not referred  to an ombudsman at the time. After  Mr W died, his 
granddaughter contacted  our Service in February 2019. As a result, this complaint was 
referred to me in April. Our Service paid Mrs W £150 in compensation for the delay.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I do not uphold it. I will explain why.
The payments on which Mr W wished to raise a chargeback  were  as follows:
£1,974.50 4 November  2008
£3,216.63 15 December 2008  (bank  transfer)
£253.39 24 June 2010
£507.86 5 July 2010 (bank transfer)
£517.67 30 November 2010
£1,496.58 7 March  2011
Ref: DRN84448122£1,454.96 8 March  2011
£1,322.97 26 October 2012
£481.89 21 January 2013
£605.00 31 January 2014
£1,148.13 19 February 2014
£1,120.26 13 October 2015
£395.00 27 January 2016
Chargeback is not available for bank transfers,  only for card payments.
(I can see no evidence  of a payment dated 7 March 2011, or for a payment of £1,454.96. 
However, the bank  statements for the joint account do show  a payment  of £1,496.58 on 8 
March 2011. In his letters  to HSBC,  Mr W described both payments on 7 and 8 March  as 
payments of €1,690 to the same company, and so I think he has probably  just counted the 
same payment twice,  with different exchange rates on different dates.)
The usual time limit for a chargeback is 120 days from the date of the payment. That had 
clearly expired by November 2016. However,  if it is not immediately apparent that the 
service paid for will not be provided,  then there  is a substituted time limit of 120 days from 
the last date that the Cardholder  expected  to receive the merchandise  or services or the 
date that the Cardholder was first made aware  that the merchandise or services  would not 
be provided.1 This is subject to an absolute and overriding time limit of 540 days from the 
date of the payment. That 540-day time limit expired for all but the last two payments.
(I have seen no evidence for the last two payments. I have seen the bank statements for the 
joint account, and they say that the account  was closed in September 2014. I therefore infer 
that the payments were made from another HSBC account, presumably a sole account in 
Mr Ws name. However, HSBC has not disputed  that these two payments were made from 
one of its accounts, and so I have not asked  to see evidence  of this.)
Those two payments were made not to timeshare  companies, but to two companies which 
promised that they could  obtain refunds of the money Mr W had paid to the timeshare  
companies. The refunds  were never  paid, and Mr and Mrs W realised that they had been 
defrauded again.
It is important  to emphasize that the 540-day time limit does not mean  that a chargeback  can 
always be brought within 540 days of the relevant payment. Rather,  a chargeback  must  still 
be brought within 120 days of whenever  the cardholder  was made aware  that the service he 
had paid for would  not be provided.  The 540 days is just a maximum time limit, beyond 
which the 120 days cannot extend.
The questions I must therefore  consider are (1) when did Mr W know  that the services  he 
paid for in 2015 and 2016 would  not be provided  to him, and (2) did he ask to raise  a 
chargeback within 120 days of learning that?
The failure to tell Mr W about the 14 days  cooling-off  period  is not a matter about which a 
chargeback can be raised,  and so it does not make a difference when he realised that was 
something he should have been told.
1 I am quoting from the edition of Visas rules which was in force in 2016.
Ref: DRN84448123As I have said, the two payments  were made  in October 2015 and January 2016, and Mr W 
asked to raise chargebacks in November 2016.  There is almost  no evidence about  when 
Mr W realised that he was not going  to receive the services he had paid for. In one of his 
letters to HSBC he said it was after a considerable amount  of time had passed without 
having received  any refunds. In another letter  he said it was after a while.  There is no 
evidence of how much  time,  if any, passed between  realising that and writing to HSBC.  But 
as long as he realised less than 120 days before he contacted HSBC, then he made  his 
chargeback request in time.
I note that the rules  say that the 120 days begins on the last date that the cardholder  
expected to receive the service, not when he should have expected it  or from the date 
when he was made aware that it would not be provided, not from the date when he should 
have worked it out. So it is not a defence to argue that Mr W ought to have realised  he had 
been conned earlier than he did.
So on the balance  of probabilities, I think that the last two payments were challenged within 
the chargeback  time limits.
I must therefore go on to consider what the likely  result would have  been  if HSBC had raised 
a chargeback dispute when Mr W asked it to.
I have read the terms and conditions which applied to the payment made  on 13 October 
2015. (I have not seen the terms relevant to the January 2016 payment, but I infer that they 
would have been similar.) They say that Mr and Mrs W were  purchasing  a lifetime 
membership of a holiday  club. There is no mention  in the agreement  of seeking refunds of 
monies paid to other holiday  clubs or timeshares. I therefore agree with what our adjudicator  
said: a chargeback would have failed,  because Mr and Mrs W got what  they paid for: 
membership.
my final decision
So my decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 June  2019.
