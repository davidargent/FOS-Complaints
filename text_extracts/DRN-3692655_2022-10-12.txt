The complaint
Miss E complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA have acted unfairly. She says theyve 
reversed a transaction following a chargeback request which has caused her financial 
difficulties.
What happened
In early April 2022, Miss E said shed received a £1,000 into her PayPal account from a 
friend. But later the same month he made a chargeback request saying he hadnt authorised 
the transaction. She said PayPal reversed the transaction which has left her short of money. 
Miss E complained to PayPal as shed evidence that the transaction had been authorised.
PayPal said Miss E wasnt covered by their Seller Protection policy as personal payments 
using the friend and family functionality werent protected. 
Miss E wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred her complaint to us.
Our investigator said she would have expected PayPal to defend the chargeback based on 
the evidence Miss E had provided. As they hadnt defended the chargeback, she said 
PayPal should refund Miss E £1,000 plus 8% simple interest from when she was deprived of 
the funds. 
PayPal didnt agree. Miss Es complaint has been referred to an ombudsman to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
In April 2022, PayPal received a chargeback request from the senders card issuer, saying 
£1,000 paid into Miss Es PayPal account hadnt been authorised by the sender. PayPal 
reversed the transaction. I can see that PayPal didnt agree to refund Miss E as they said the 
transaction fell outside of its Seller Protection policy.
But I think the crux of this complaint is not whether PayPal has exercised its Seller 
Protection policy correctly. But whether PayPal could have done more for Miss E and 
provided information to dispute the chargeback that the transaction hadnt been authorised 
by the sender.
I dont think that PayPal has acted fairly. Miss E has sent evidence to PayPal that looks to 
show the sender had authorised the transaction. And informs her that he is being pressured 
to dispute the transaction after intervention by his girlfriend and family members. 
I accept PayPals argument that the decision to decide upon the chargeback is ultimately 
made by the card issuer and not by them. But I cant see anything which suggests that the 
information provided by Miss E in support of the transaction having been authorised by the 
sender shouldnt have or couldnt have been disclosed to the card issuer. And I think that 
had it been disclosed, it might have changed the outcome for Miss E, as the evidence 
appears to dispute the transaction hadnt been authorised by the sender. 
But I cant see that PayPal disclosed this evidence to the card issuer, from what I can see 
they only considered whether they could refund Miss E under their Seller Protection policy, 
which they couldnt. And this meant Miss E had  a £1,000 removed from her PayPal account 
which she said caused her financial difficulty as she had already used the £1,000. 
I cant know whether the evidence Miss E had if seen would have changed the card issuers 
chargeback outcome decision. But by PayPal failing to defend the chargeback Miss Es 
evidence that it had been authorised by the sender wasnt considered, and this has had a 
financial impact on her. 
In the circumstances, I dont think PayPal acted fairly and reasonably as they didnt assist 
Miss E in defending the chargeback request. To put things right PayPal  should reimburse 
Miss E the £1,000 which she has lost. And to compensate her for the deprivation of these 
funds add 8% simple interest from the date the monies were reversed to the date PayPal 
refund Miss E.
I understand Miss E has asked for her PayPal account to be closed, this is a matter for her 
and PayPal if she wishes to reactivate her account. Ill make no comments about this.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. And ask PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to:
refund the reversed transaction of £1,000 to Miss E, plus 8% simple interest from 
date of reversal to settlement.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 November 2022.
