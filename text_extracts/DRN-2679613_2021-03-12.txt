The complaint
F complained that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) blocked its business account 
and it was unable to withdraw funds. 
F are represented in this complaint by one of the partners, Mr S, but for ease Ill refer to all 
actions and comments as those of F. 
What happened
F had a business account with PayPal that was opened in 2017. In June 2020 PayPal asked 
F to provide additional information in order to comply with industry regulations. This meant 
that Fs account was blocked and they were unable to withdraw money from the account 
until the information that had been requested was given to PayPal.  
F became aware of the block on the account when they logged onto their account at around 
the end of June 2020. 
There was then quite a lot of correspondence, largely by email or online between F and 
PayPal. And F provided some of the information requested by PayPal, including signing a 
declaration to confirm they wanted to downgrade the status of their business. But PayPal 
said there were discrepancies in the information provided by F and so the matter was 
unresolved. 
F referred the complaint to this service in September 2020. F said it believed it had provided 
all necessary information requested by PayPal to have the account unblocked. F also said 
PayPal constantly moved the goalposts and F had to speak to different agents at PayPal 
who provided different suggestions of how this could be resolved. 
While this service was investigating Fs complaint, PayPal allowed the block to be removed 
from the account and F were able to withdraw their money. 
Our investigator upheld Fs complaint and thought PayPal hadnt communicated clearly 
enough with F to let them know what information they needed to send once PayPal knew it 
wasnt possible to downgrade the account. She asked PayPal to pay £100 compensation. 
PayPal disagreed with the outcome and so this has come to me for a decision. 
I issued a provisional decision on 9 February 2021 and said I didnt intend to uphold this 
complaint. I gave both parties until 11 March 2021 to respond. Neither party has responded. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I am not upholding this complaint. 
From what I can see, PayPal asked F to provide additional information about their business 
as it needed this to comply with industry regulations. And regulated businesses like PayPal 
will often need to periodically ask consumers to update the information it holds on them. So 
PayPal acted fairly when it asked F to provide additional information and when it blocked Fs 
account until it received this. I know this caused unexpected disruption and inconvenience 
for F, but Im satisfied this was a reasonable request for PayPal to make. 
I can see that F queried why they were ever allowed to open an account in the first place 
without this information. But the issue here is that regulations change, and that PayPal may 
occasionally have to contact consumers to ask them to update their information. 
In any event, F didnt object to providing the information and I can see that a good deal of 
time and effort was spent trying to provide PayPal with what it asked for. And at some stage, 
Fs focus moved to doing what they could to close the account, as it became increasingly 
frustrating for them that they didnt have access to their account and the money in it. 
The issue that seems to have caused the most confusion and perhaps prevented this from 
being resolved more quickly, was the conflicting information that PayPal had about the legal 
status of Fs business. 
PayPal asked F to provide documentation to evidence the legal status of their business. But 
F had difficulty providing this and so PayPal suggested that the account could be 
downgraded if necessary, to show the business was no longer the same legal entity as when 
the account was opened. So F signed a declaration to say the legal status of the business 
had changed. And this is where the confusion arose, because the legal status of Fs 
business hadnt actually changed at all. And so, on the one hand, PayPal had a declaration 
from F that said the status of the business was one thing, when official documents 
suggested it was another. So PayPal couldnt remove the block until it sorted out the 
conflicting information it had about Fs business. 
It wasnt until F made a complaint to this service that the block was removed. I can see that 
PayPal agreed to resolve this complaint outside of its usual processes. And because the 
resolution was outside PayPals usual way of doing things, I dont think it would be fair to 
expect PayPal to have resolved it in this way to start with. 
Our investigator suggested F should be compensated £100 for the distress and 
inconvenience caused by PayPals failure to communicate clearly with F. But Ive decided 
that I dont think compensation is appropriate on this occasion. I realise that F found this 
situation frustrating and theres no doubt they didnt have access to their account for a 
lengthy period of time. But I think PayPal communicated as effectively as it could with F. I 
dont think PayPal realised F had only signed the declaration to downgrade their account 
because F thought this was the correct way to ensure the block was lifted and they could get 
access to their money. Instead, I think PayPal thought F had genuinely started to trade 
differently and it was right to query the conflicting information in the way it did. 
I know that F were also unhappy that numerous different PayPal agents dealt with them 
while they were trying to provide the information. And I can see this was the case. I think that 
it might have been more helpful if F had a single point of contact, particularly when it was 
clear this matter wasnt going to be resolved quickly. However, this service cant tell PayPal 
how to manage its own processes as this is a business decision that its for PayPal to make. 
My final decision
Its my final decision that I do not uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask F to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 April 2021.
