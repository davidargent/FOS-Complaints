The complaint
Miss R complained that PayrNet Limited reviewed, closed, and withheld access to the funds 
in an electronic money account. The account was operated by an agent of PayrNet, but to 
keep things simple Ill refer to PayrNet in this decision.
What happened
Miss R had an account with PayrNet which opened in 2017. In March 2021, Miss R received 
two payments into her account, of £160 and £5. But a few days later PayrNet received a 
report from the senders bank that the payment was part of a scam. The report said the 
sender had tried to buy clothing online but hadnt received the goods and couldnt now 
contact the sender. PayrNet restricted the account. During this period, Miss R was sent a 
number of payments from an online marketplace. PayrNet says these payments were 
declined  Miss R says the online marketplace has told her these were successfully sent to 
her account. In May 2021, PayrNet removed the balance from the account with a view to 
returning the funds to its senders and in July 2021 told Miss R it had decided to close the 
account.
While all this was happening, Miss R complained to PayrNet and referred her complaint to 
us.
I issued my provisional findings on the complaint on 12 October 2022. I said that Id 
considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. I said that financial businesses like PayrNet are subject 
to legal and regulatory requirements to combat fraud and financial crime  and that the terms 
and conditions that applied to Miss Rs account also allowed PayrNet to close, suspend or 
restrict access to Miss Rs account where it suspected unauthorised or fraudulent use of her 
account. It also allowed PayrNet to restrict use of the account and card to request 
information about the source of funds in the account. And where PayrNet does this, it 
doesnt need to give reasons.
I said that in Miss Rs case PayrNet had received a report from a bank that two of the 
payments into her account were fraudulent. These were payments for £5 and £160, which 
the report said were made to pay for goods online which the sender hadnt received. So I 
didnt think it was unfair for PayrNet to restrict the account while it looked into things.
That said, I thought PayrNet or its agent should have carried out some investigation into the 
payment before it decided what to do next. I noted that the report was made just four days 
after the disputed payment  which, given the content of the report, might have suggested a 
dispute between a buyer and seller. Then Miss R emailed PayrNet to explain the payment 
was from a friend of hers  she said the payer wanted to know what had happened to the 
funds and provided a code from the payers bank to help locate it.
I also saw that PayrNets agent appeared to have noticed the fraud report was unusual  
Miss R had received further payments from the same payer which hadnt been disputed. 
According to the statements of account, Miss R had received £165 in March, £65 in 
February, £65 in January, £285 in December and £90 in November. This accounted for 
around half the balance of Miss Rs account. Yet the payer had only disputed the final two 
payments.
With all this in mind, I thought PayrNet needed to do more here before it could safely 
conclude that Miss R wasnt entitled to the funds. 
I considered what would most likely have happened had PayrNet carried out an adequate 
investigation. Miss R had told us that the payer was a friend who sometimes helps her out 
when she needs money. When asked, Miss R has been able to provide emails and bank 
statements from the payer  and so, contrary to the fraud report from the third party bank, 
does appear to have been in contact with the payer. So I concluded that if PayrNet had 
carried out an investigation, Miss R would have been able to provide evidence supporting 
her version of events, and PayrNet would reasonably have known the fraud report was 
mistaken.
Turning to the closure of the account, the terms allowed PayrNet to close the account at any 
time, but unless there were exceptional circumstances it would give Miss R 60 days notice. 
Given what Id said about the fraud report, I didnt think exceptional circumstances applied 
here. I wasnt satisfied Miss R was involved in any fraud. Given PayrNet blocked the 
account, Miss R lost use of the account immediately. And I could see this caused 
inconvenience.
For these reasons, I didnt think PayrNet had acted reasonably in closing the account or 
returning the funds within it to source.
I also found that PayrNet had taken a long time to complete its review. It received the report 
in March 2021. It removed funds from the account in May 2021. It didnt close the account 
until July 2021  and said it had only returned the funds to the payer in August 2022. Much 
of this delay appears to have been avoidable. As a result Miss R has been kept out of the 
funds and had the inconvenience of having to chase the payer to find out what had 
happened to them. I also noted that PayrNet was telling us Miss R needed to approach the 
recipients of the funds to find out what had happened to them at a time it hadnt in fact 
returned them.
Finally, I considered the declined payments. Miss R said that payments from an online 
marketplace had gone missing. PayrNet says that after the account was suspended it 
declined these transactions. But I had seen emails from the online marketplace saying they 
were successful  and that Miss R should contact PayrNet to find out what had happened.
For all these reasons I said the complaint should be upheld. To put things right I thought 
PayrNet should pay Miss R the £780 it withdrew from her account that she hasnt already got 
back, plus the £140.90 in missing payments from the online marketplace. I thought it should 
pay simple interest from 23 March 2021 on what PayrNet withdrew until Miss R gets the 
funds back. And I thought PayrNet should pay Miss R £200 for the distress and 
inconvenience it caused. I acknowledged that PayrNet said it had already sent back some of 
these funds. But Miss R hadnt been able to get this back from the payees, who, in the case 
of her friend, said she hadnt received it. But while I accepted there was a risk Miss R might 
ultimately get the money back twice, Id already concluded it wasnt fair for PayrNet to have 
removed the money from Miss Rs account, and I didnt think it would be fair for Miss R to 
lose out because of something PayrNet did.
I said Id consider any further comments in response to my provisional decision.
PayrNet doesnt think my provisional findings are reasonable. They say my recommendation 
goes against their policies  and it is their understanding that the ombudsman service cannot dictate or make changes to how they operate as a business. It says that after it received the 
fraud notification it had a duty to act on the report it received  and that its current 
relationship with its payment provider means it doesnt have the facilities to allow a customer 
to defend the claim it receives.
It says that it has a policy to return all the funds in the account to source, and that this is in in 
line with its legal and regulatory obligations. It is satisfied the funds have been returned to 
source in line with the terms and conditions that apply to the account.
It says it has also been in touch with the online marketplace about the missing payments. It 
says that it has shown the incoming transfers were declined due to the block on her account 
 which shows they never received the funds. It says this wasnt accounted for in the 
decision. It has also sent us a record it says shows it made a payment of £670 to the payer. 
As this amount has already been returned, it doesnt think it should pay this again. It doesnt 
see how that could be fair. It does, however, agree to pay £200 compensation.
Miss R has contacted us to say she agreed with the proposed resolution to her complaint. 
Shes also sent us further correspondence from the online marketplace. It says that all the 
missing payments were disbursed to Miss Rs account with PayrNet, and it has no record 
that these were returned.
Ive therefore looked at the complaint afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive carefully considered the points raised by both Miss R and PayrNet. Having done so, I 
reach the same conclusions for the same reasons.
I acknowledge PayrNets comments in response to my provisional findings. PayrNet says it 
cannot agree with my findings as it goes against its policies  and it says that I am unable to 
dictate or make changes to how it operates as a business. 
Im satisfied that I need to decide this complaint based on whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of the complaint. In doing so I must take into account relevant law and 
regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and what I 
consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time. As such, the key question 
is whether, in the individual circumstances of Miss Rs complaint, PayrNet has treated 
Miss R fairly. I make no findings about PayrNets processes and practices more generally  
that would be a matter for the regulator.
PayrNet had received a fraud report from a third party bank. But for the reasons Ive already 
explained, this report was unusual. PayrNet noted that it was unusual at the time. One of its 
staff noted that there were further payments from the same payer to the account  which 
hadnt been reported. And Miss R contacted PayrNet with details from the senders bank  
suggesting she was still in touch with the payer.
While I note PayrNets comments about returning funds to source, I see that it has since 
then in fact returned some of the funds to Miss R. And while I accept that the terms and 
conditions allowed PayrNet to return funds to source, the same term also refers to returning 
any outstanding balance to the account holder via transfer to a UK bank account.Based on everything Ive seen, Im not persuaded it was fair to return the funds to source in 
the individual circumstances of Miss Rs complaint.
Turning to the payments that PayrNet says it declined and returned to the online 
marketplace, I note that the online marketplace has now written to Miss R confirming it sent 
the funds to her account and that it hasnt received them back. I acknowledge what PayrNet 
has sent me about that  it has sent me screenshots showing these payments were 
declined. But Im not persuaded that this means I can conclude that these payments were 
necessarily returned  and Im mindful that PayrNet likewise claimed that other payments 
had been returned to source when it hadnt yet done so. 
I also acknowledge what PayrNet says about returning the remaining funds in the account to 
the payer. But for the reasons above, and as I explained in my provisional decision, Im not 
persuaded it was reasonable for PayrNet to return the funds to source  and I dont think it 
would be fair for Miss R to lose out because of something PayrNet did wrong. 
For these reasons, I reach the same conclusions for the same reasons.
Putting things right
For the reasons above, PayrNet should:
Pay Miss R the £780 it withdrew from her account that she hasnt already got back
Pay Miss R the £140.90 that went missing from the online marketplace
Pay Miss R simple interest on these amounts (the rate is 8%) from 23 March 2021 
until Miss R gets the funds back.
Pay Miss R £200 for the distress and inconvenience this caused.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold this complaint. PayrNet Limited should put things right by 
doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 January 2023.
