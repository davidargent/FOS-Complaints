The complaint
Mr M complains about the service provided to him by Santander Consumer (UK) Plc  trading 
as Santander Consumer Finance (Santander) following his request for a calculation in 
support of a conditional sale agreement (agreement) early settlement figure it had 
provided. 
What happened
In March 2022 Mr M entered into an agreement with Santander for a used car costing 
£25,319.00. Under the terms of the agreement, everything else being equal, Mr M undertook 
to make an advance payment of £9,426.00 followed by 30 monthly payments of £181.65 and 
1 monthly payment of £13,872.00 making a total sum repayable of £28,747.50 at an APR of 
9.3%.
In May 2022 Mr M, at his request, was supplied with an early settlement figure (by 
Santander) of £16,165.77.
In June 2022 Mr M, at his request, was supplied with an early settlement figure (by 
Santander) of £15,967.97. 
In June 2022 Mr M settled his agreement by sending Santander the sum of £15,967.97.
On 23 June 2022 Mr M wrote to Santander asking for a calculation in support of its 
£15,967.97 early settlement figure.
On 19 August 2022 Mr M wrote to Santander again asking for a calculation in support of its 
£15,967.97 early settlement figure.
On 26 September 2022 Mr M wrote to Santander again for a calculation in support of its 
£15,967.97 early settlement figure.
On 10 November 2022 Santander sent Mr M an email in response to his earlier requests for 
a calculation in support of its £15,967.97 early settlement figure.
On 14 November 2022 Mr M wrote to Santander again asking for a calculation in support of 
its £15,967.97 early settlement figure by post, not by any other means.
In January 2023 and having not received a calculation in support of Santanders £15,967.97 
early settlement figure by post Mr M complained to our service.
On 10 February 2023 Santander sent Mr M a calculation in support of its £15,967.97 early 
settlement figure by post and email.
On 20 February 2023 Santander issued Mr M with a final response letter (FRL). Under 
cover of this FRL Santander confirmed a calculation in support of its £15,967.97 early 
settlement figure had been sent by post and email and the figure of £15,967.97 was correct. 
However, it went on to say that it accepted its failure to provide this calculation sooner was 
poor service and for this it was prepared to pay £100.
Mr Ms complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
Santanders early settlement figure of £15,967.97 was correct and its offer of £100 for the 
delay in providing a calculation in support of that figure was both fair and reasonable.
Mr M didnt agree and so his complaint has been passed to me for review and decision. In 
response to the investigators view Mr M said, in summary:
His complaint has never been about whether the early settlement figure of 
£15,967.97 was correct or not.
His complaint is about Santanders repeated failure to answer his correspondence 
and to provide him with a simple and accessible explanation of how the figure of 
£15,967.97 was calculated.
Santander has still not provided him with a simple and accessible explanation of how 
the figure of £15,967.97 was calculated.
Santander should have to compensate him £300.00.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear Mr M has very strong feelings about this complaint. He has provided detailed
submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their
entirety. However, I trust that Mr M will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The purpose
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them.
I appreciate Mr M doesnt agree, but Im satisfied that in early February 2023 Santander 
provided him with what he had been asking for since late June 2022, that is a calculation in 
support of the early settlement figure of £15,967.97.
However, I also accept that Mr M shouldnt have been put to the inconvenience of having to 
chase Santander for such a calculation. So, Ive gone on to consider what Santander should 
have to do to fairly and reasonably compensate Mr M for this inconvenience.
In my view Mr M should have received a calculation from Santander in support of its early 
settlement figure of £15,967.97 shortly after he sent his request for the same in late 
June 2022. And had he done so, he wouldnt have needed to write to Santander again. 
So, I think its only fair that Santander compensates Mr M for having to send four 
unnecessary letters between mid August 2022 and mid November 2022 (including the one 
he sent after Santander sent him an inadequate email response on 10 November 2022) and 
for him having to wait in the region of seven months for a calculation in support of the 
£15,967.97 early settlement figure, albeit I accept that Mr M doesnt agree what Santander 
sent him on 10 February 2023 was a sufficient response to his request(s).Mr M is correct in that when considering what compensation a business should pay, regard 
needs to be given to any unnecessary time spent by a consumer in trying to obtain what they 
are entitled to. But we dont make awards based on units of time and everyones time is 
equally precious. And this is regardless of what a consumer may earn or some other 
monetary measure  such as the national minimum wage. 
I would also add that its reasonable and necessary time spent by a consumer in trying to 
obtain what they are entitled to, not how much time they actually spent or say they spent, 
that I need to have regard to. Furthermore, we dont normally award anything for the time 
spent by a consumer in making complaint submissions to our service.
Again, I appreciate Mr M doesnt agree, but taking everything into account (including what I 
say above) Im satisfied that payment of £100 for inconvenience is, in the particular 
circumstances of this case, entirely appropriate.
My final decision
My final decision is that Santander Consumer (UK) Plc  trading as Santander Consumer 
Finance, to the extent it hasnt done so already, must pay Mr M £100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2023.
