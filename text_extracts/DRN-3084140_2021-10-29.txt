The complaint
Mrs C is unhappy that NewDay Ltd approved her for credit at times when the credit wasnt 
affordable for her. Mrs C is also unhappy that NewDay transferred one of her accounts to a 
debt collection company.  
What happened
Mrs C has a number differently branded NewDay administered accounts. Mrs C fell into 
financial difficulty and struggled to meet the contractual payments required on the accounts. 
Mrs C contacted NewDay and made them aware of her financial difficulties, but NewDay 
passed one of her accounts to a debt collection company. Mrs C wasnt happy about this, 
and she also felt that NewDay shouldnt have approved her for credit that she couldnt 
reasonably afford. So, she raised a complaint.
NewDay looked at Mrs Cs complaint. They felt that they had undertaken checks into Mrs Cs 
financial position at the times that theyd offered her credit, and that thered been nothing 
resulting from these checks that should have given them cause to suspect that Mrs C might 
not be able to afford the credit being offered to her. So, they didnt uphold that aspect of Mrs 
Cs complaint.
However, NewDay did acknowledge that when Mrs C informed them of her financial 
difficulties and they negotiated a payment arrangement with her, that one of her accounts 
hadnt been included in the discussion and had later been transferred to a debt collection 
company. NewDay apologised for this and removed £37.87 of incurred fees and charges 
from the account. NewDay also offered to make a payment of £25 to Mrs C to compensate 
her for the inconvenience shed incurred.
Mrs C wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this 
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that while it had been 
reasonable for NewDay to offer credit to Mrs C at the beginning of the business relationship, 
it should later have become evident to NewDay, given how Mrs C struggled to manage some 
of her NewDay accounts, that Mrs C was potentially experiencing financial difficulties, such 
that the provision of further credit to Mrs C shouldnt have taken place. Our investigator 
therefore recommended that this complaint be upheld in Mrs Cs favour on that basis.
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how much 
and on what terms. What this service would expect would be that, before approving a 
customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of credit available to a 
customer on an existing line of credit, the business would undertake reasonable and 
proportionate borrower focussed checks to ensure that any credit being offered to a 
customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
NewDay say that they did that here. At the point of application for each of the differently 
branded accounts, they took information from Mrs C about her household income to check 
that she could afford any potential monthly repayments that might become due on the 
account. Additionally, NewDay also obtained information from a credit reference agency to 
better understand Mrs Cs wider financial position. 
Also, at the time that NewDay increased the credit limit on one of Mrs Cs accounts, they 
reviewed how Mrs C had managed her account to that point as well as obtained updated 
information from a credit reference agency to refresh their understanding of Mrs Cs wider 
financial position.
NewDay believe that there wasnt anything resulting from any of these checks which they 
feel should reasonably have given them cause to suspect that the credit being offered to 
Mrs C at those times was unaffordable for her, and because of this NewDay feel that they 
didnt act unfairly or unreasonably by providing the credit to Mrs C that they did.
Mrs C applied for the first of her NewDay administered accounts in November 2015. At that 
time, Mrs C informed NewDay that she was employed with an annual income of £12,500 and 
that she had approximately £21,000 in existing credit card debt. NewDay noted that Mrs C 
had a high level of indebtedness when compared to her relatively low income, but they also 
noted that Mrs Cs credit file information showed that she wasnt in arrears on any of her 
existing credit accounts. 
On this basis, NewDay approved Mrs Cs application and issued her with a credit card with a 
£900 limit. And Im satisfied, given the conclusions that NewDay were reasonably able to 
draw about Mrs Cs financial position at that time  specifically, that while Mrs C did have a 
relatively high level of existing credit, she wasnt struggling to manage that credit at that time 
 as well as the relatively low amount of credit that NewDay provided to Mrs C here, that it 
was reasonable for NewDay to have approved this application in the manner that they did.
However, at the time of the next provision of credit  which was an increase in the credit limit 
on this first credit account, from £900 to £1,950, which took place in September 2016  it 
appears that the picture of Mrs Cs financial position that I feel NewDay ought reasonably to 
have drawn is less positive. And Im not convinced that it was fair or reasonable for NewDay 
to have increased the credit limit on Mrs Cs existing credit account because of this.
NewDay have stated that they reviewed how Mrs C had managed her existing NewDay 
credit account up to the point of the credit limit increase, and that Mrs Cs management of 
her account didnt give them cause to suspect that the credit limit increase to £1,950 might 
be unaffordable for Mrs C at that time.
But its evident from the monthly statements for Mrs Cs credit account that Mrs C was 
struggling to maintain the account balance within the £900 credit limit at that time and the 
account was regularly over that credit limit in the months leading up to the credit limit 
increase. This meant that Mrs C was incurring over limit charges on the account, and Im not 
convinced that it was fair or reasonable for NewDay to have more than doubled the amount 
of credit available to Mrs C at that time, given that it seems clear that Mrs C was struggling 
to meet the financial commitments of the account at the existing lower level of credit.
NewDay have stated that they also reviewed information from a credit reference agency at 
the point of the credit limit increase to refresh their understanding of Mrs Cs wider financial position, and that this confirmed that Mrs C wasnt struggling to meet any of her other 
existing credit commitments. 
I can appreciate NewDays position here  to a degree. But I dont feel that NewDays 
assessment of Mrs Cs credit file information should have overridden the more detailed 
information contained within the NewDay account statements which Im satisfied did provide 
a clear indication that Mrs C might be struggling financially. 
All of which means that I do feel that the information available to NewDay at the time of the 
credit limit increase on Mrs Cs first NewDay credit account in September 2016 was such 
that NewDay should have reasonably concluded that Mrs C might not be able to afford the 
credit limit increase such that the increase shouldnt have been implemented. And it follows 
from this that I will be upholding this aspect of Mrs Cs complaint.
The next provision of credit took place in March 2017, when Mrs C applied for a new 
differently branded NewDay administered credit account  brand two. At the point of 
application, Mrs C told NewDay that she had an annual income of £8,500, and that there 
was other household income of £35,000 that could be taken into consideration. NewDay also 
obtained information from a credit reference agency which confirmed that Mrs C wasnt in 
arrears on any of her other existing credit accounts and appeared to show that Mrs C was 
managing her existing credit without incident at that time.
Ive also reviewed the statements for the NewDay administered brand one account that Mrs 
C already held for the months leading up to this application. And, while Mrs C did maintain 
the balance of the brand one account close to the credit limit, its evident from the statements 
that the balance never went over the credit limit and that Mrs C made the payments 
necessary to maintain that account within the contractual terms. 
Accordingly, Im satisfied that it was reasonable for NewDay to conclude, based upon the 
information that was available to NewDay at that time, that it was more likely than not that 
Mrs M would have been able to afford the brand two credit account that she was applying 
for, especially given the relatively modest credit limit of £900 that the credit card was initially 
issued to Mrs C with, and which wasnt subsequently increased.
The final two provisions of credit both took place in August 2018. At that time, Mrs C applied 
for two more differently branded NewDay administered accounts  brands three and four  
both of which were applied for with £500 credit limits.
At the time of the applications, Mrs C advised NewDay that she had an annual income of 
about £15,000 and that there was other household income via her partner that could be 
taken into consideration. Additionally, the information that NewDay obtained from the credit 
reference agency confirmed that Mrs C wasnt in arrears on any of her existing credit 
commitments and that her total amount of existing credit had reduced slightly since the 
application the previous year for the brand two account.
At first glance, it may appear reasonable for NewDay to have approved these applications. 
However, Mrs C held two active NewDay administered accounts at the time of these 
applications, and the statements of these accounts provide clear indications that Mrs C 
might have been struggling financially at that time.
I say this because on the statements for both the brand one and the brand two accounts for 
the months leading up to the new applications, its evident that Mrs C had failed to keep the 
balance of those accounts within the respective credit limits on several occasions, including 
in the months immediately prior to the new applications, and that shed incurred overlimit 
fees on both of her existing NewDay administered accounts because of this.It therefore doesnt seem fair to me, given that there was clear evidence that Mrs C was 
struggling to maintain her existing NewDay administered accounts and was incurring fees as 
a result, that NewDay would then approve Mrs C for two additional credit accounts, thus 
potentially increasing Mrs Cs level of indebtedness at a time when there were clear 
indicators that she couldnt potentially manage the level of credit that she already held. And it 
follows that Ill be upholding this aspect of Mrs C complaint accordingly.
Finally, Mrs C has is also unhappy that, when she contacted NewDay and advised them that 
she was struggling to meet the account payments on all of her accounts, that the brand one 
account was still subsequently passed by NewDay to a debt collection company. NewDay 
acknowledged in their response to Mrs cs complaint that they made an error in this regard, 
and they apologised to Mrs C and reimbursed applicable interest and charges to that 
account, and also credited the account with £25 by way of compensation. This feels fair to 
me, and I wont be instructing NewDay to take any further action in this regard.
All of which means that, while Im satisfied that it was reasonable for NewDay to provide the 
initial provision of credit for both the brand one account in November 2015 and the brand two 
account in March 2017, I feel that the information that was available to NewDay at the time 
of the credit limit increase on brand one, which took place in September 2016, and also at 
the time of the provisions of credit for brands three and four in August 2018, was such that 
NewDay should have concluded that Mrs C might be in financially difficulty at those times 
and that those provisions of credit shouldnt have then been implemented by NewDay.
I realise that this might not be the outcome that NewDay wanted here, but it follows from this 
that Ill be upholding this complaint in Mrs Cs favour on that basis and issuing corrective 
instructions to NewDay accordingly. I trust that NewDay will understand, given all that Ive 
explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
  
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse to Mrs Cs brand one account all interest, fees and charges 
incurred or accrued on the account from the point of the credit limit increase in September 
2016 onwards for the portion of the balance above the initial credit limit amount of £900.
NewDay must also reimburse to Mrs Cs brands three and four accounts all interest, fees 
and charges incurred or accrued on those accounts from the point of account opening.
If these reimbursements result in any of the accounts having a credit balance in Mrs Cs 
favour, these balances must be paid to Mrs C along with 8% interest calculated to the date 
of the payment to Mrs C. These payments may not take the form of credits to the relevant 
accounts unless Mrs C gives her permission for them to do so.
For any accounts which, after the reimbursements, continue to have a balance outstanding 
for Mrs C to pay, NewDay must contact Mrs C to arrange a suitable repayment plan in 
consideration of Mrs Cs financial circumstances at that time.
Finally, NewDay must remove all adverse reporting from Mrs Cs credit file for the brand one 
account from September 2016 onwards and for brands three and four from the points of 
account opening.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis explained 
above.  Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 November 2021.
