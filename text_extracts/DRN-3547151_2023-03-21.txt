The complaint
Mr D complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he and his partner paid for some holiday club 
membership points. Hes being represented in his complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr D and his partner had bought a trial membership of a holiday club in June 2010 and they 
entered into an acquisition agreement to upgrade their membership in July 2010 by buying 
some membership points. The purchase price of the points was £15,034 and they traded in 
their trial membership which was given a value of £5,795 so the balance due from them was 
£9,239. Mr D entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a 
loan of £11,439 (which included £2,200 to consolidate the finance that had been taken out 
with another finance provider to pay for part of the cost of the trial membership). Mr D 
agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £171.53 to Barclays Partner Finance. 
Mr D and his partner upgraded their membership again in September 2010 when they 
entered into another acquisition to buy some more membership points. The purchase price 
of those points was £6,610 and Mr Ds partner entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that amount. She agreed to make 180 monthly 
repayments of £99.53 to Barclays Partner Finance.
Both loans were repaid in February 2013 and I understand that Mr D and his partner then 
bought a different type of membership from the holiday company in September 2014. Mr Ds 
and his partners representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in March 2018 
about the July 2010 purchase under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said 
that the points were mis-sold and, but for the misrepresentations made, Mr D and his partner 
wouldnt have purchased the points nor entered into a loan agreement. It said that the terms 
of the agreement were unfair as an undisclosed commission was paid and they were 
pressured into entering the loan agreement. A statement from Mr D was provided. Mr D and 
his partner have also made a complaint to the other finance provider relating to the trial 
membership agreement and that complaint is being considered separately.
Barclays Partner Finance issued two final response letters  one dealing with the loan made 
to Mr D and the other dealing with the loan made to his partner. It said that Mr D and his 
partner were out of time to bring any claim in respect of the acquisition agreements but it 
also set out the reasons that it didnt consider that theyd been mis-sold to them or that there 
were unfair relationships. Mr D and his partner werent satisfied with its responses so a 
complaint was made to this service. Their complaint form says that Barclays Partner Finance 
paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to them, the holiday 
company failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan, unduly 
pressured them into entering the agreements and used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure them and the membership was misrepresented. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ds and his partners complaint should be upheld. 
She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr D and his 
partner and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court 
would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. 
Mr Ds and his partners representative, on their behalf, has asked for their complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It has responded to our investigators recommendations in 
detail and sets out further reasons that it considers that there was an unfair relationship. Our 
investigator then said that she hadnt seen anything to persuade her that the lending was 
unaffordable at the time of the loans and she explained why she didnt consider that 
Barclays Partner Finance had acted incorrectly in connection with any commission that it 
paid to the holiday company.
The July 2010 loan was made to Mr D and he is an eligible complainant to make a complaint 
relating to that loan agreement. The September 2010 loan was made to Mr Ds partner and 
she is an eligible complainant to make a complaint relating to that loan agreement. There are 
two separate complaints and in this decision Im only considering Mr Ds complaint about 
Barclays Partner Finance. Mr Ds partners complaint about Barclays Partner Finance will be 
considered in a separate decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ds complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ds complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claim that hed 
made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to 
his claim;
Mr Ds claim was made under section 140A but Im not determining the outcome of 
that claim in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im considering 
whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to that claim was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
I consider it to be clear from Mr Ds representatives letter to Barclays Partner 
Finance in March 2018 and the complaint form that was sent to this service that his 
claim was made under section 140A and that no claim was made under section 75 of 
the Consumer Credit Act so I havent considered any complaint about Barclays 
Partner Finances response to a claim under section 75;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;Barclays Partner has provided evidence to show that the loan that it made to Mr D 
was repaid in February 2013, less than six years before his section 140A claim was 
made to Barclays Partner Finance, so I dont consider that Mr Ds section 140A claim 
is time-barred;
Mr Ds and his partners representative described in the letter that it sent to Barclays 
Partner Finance in March 2018 the ways that it says that the membership was mis-
sold to Mr D and his partner in July 2010 and the ways that it was misrepresented to 
them;
Mr D provided a witness statement in which he describes what he says happened  
he says that they were told that the more points they had, the less ground rent they 
would have to pay and there would be more availability (but he says that isn't the 
case) and that buying more points would solve all of the issues that they had;
Mr Ds and his partners complaint form says that: Barclays Partner Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to them; the holiday 
company failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan, 
unduly pressured them into entering the agreements and used aggressive 
commercial practices to pressure them; and the membership was misrepresented;
Mr D and his partner bought a trial membership in March 2010, they upgraded their 
membership in July 2010 when they bought some membership points, they bought 
more membership points in September 2010 and they upgraded again in September 
2014 when they bought a different type of membership;
in July 2010, Mr D and his partner signed the acquisition agreement (which included 
its terms and conditions) and a membership declaration and the evidence shows that 
between July 2010 and September 2014 they completed eleven bookings with the 
holiday club (and made but cancelled seven more bookings);
Ive carefully considered what Mr D has said in his statement and the other 
information that his representative has provided (including its detailed response to 
our investigators recommendations) but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the membership points were misrepresented to Mr D and his 
partner by the holiday company in July 2010 or that they were induced into entering 
into the acquisition agreement by any misrepresentations;
nor am I persuaded that the terms of the acquisition agreement are unfair or that the 
membership points were mis-sold to Mr D and his partner;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr D and his partner complained to the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance about any of those issues until March 2018  
more than seven years later and in that time they twice entered into more 
agreements with the holiday company  if they considered that the membership 
points had been misrepresented or mis-sold to them in July 2010, I consider that it 
would be reasonable to expect them not to have entered into further agreements with 
the holiday company;
Mr Ds and his partners representative says that Barclays Partner Finance paid an 
undisclosed commission to the holiday company  but Ive not been provided with 
any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by Barclays Partner 
Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr D 
and his partner risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr Ds and his partners representative says the holiday company failed to conduct a 
proper assessment of Mr D and his partners ability to afford the loan  Ive seen no 
evidence to show what if any affordability assessment was made before Barclays 
Partner Finance made the loan to Mr D in July 2010 but they completed an 
application for a loan from another finance provider in March 2010 and provided the 
holiday company with information about their employment, income and home 
ownership and Ive seen no evidence to show that their circumstances changed 
significantly between then and July 2010;
Mr D repaid the July 2010 loan in February 2013 and at about the same time his 
partner repaid the loan that had been made to her in September 2010 and Ive seen 
no evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr D when it was made to 
him in July 2010;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr D asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its affordability assessment before March 2018  as the loan was 
made to him in July 2010 and was repaid in February 2013, I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect him to have raised any concerns about the affordability of 
the loan before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr D and his partner 
were unduly pressured into buying the membership points in July 2010, that Mr D 
was unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable commercial practices against them  Ive seen no 
evidence to show that Mr D complained to Barclays Partner Finance about those 
issues until March 2018 (more than seven years after the loan had been made to 
him) and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained to 
Barclays Partner Finance about any such issues before then;
Mr Ds and his partners representatives response to our investigators 
recommendations includes claims about the unfairness of the management charges 
and other claims which werent included in the claim that was made to Barclays 
Partner Finance in March 2018 or in the complaint form that was provided to this 
service  as those claims havent been made to Barclays Partner Finance Im unable 
to make any finding about them in this decision;
Im not persuaded that Mr D has provided enough evidence to show that his 
relationship with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be 
likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr D 
and Barclays Partner Finance in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance said that Mr Ds claims were time-barred under the 
Limitation Act but it also set out the reasons that it didnt consider that the 
membership points had been mis-sold to him or that there was an unfair relationship 
and I consider that it was fair and reasonable for it not to uphold Mr Ds claim under 
section 140A; and
I sympathise with Mr D for the issues that he and his partner have had with their 
memberships, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mr D any of the money that 
hes paid under the loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 April 2023.
