The complaint
Mrs A complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to her the money that she paid for some holiday club membership 
points. Her husband is also involved in her complaint and shes being represented by a legal 
adviser.
What happened
Mrs A says that she and her husband inherited a timeshare membership in June 2010 and 
that they exchanged a week for a stay in another resort in February 2013. They entered into 
a purchase agreement to buy 61,500 holiday club membership points in February 2013. The 
purchase price of the points was £4,500 and Mrs A transferred to the holiday company two 
existing timeshare weeks. She also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance for a loan of £4,500 and agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £61.44 
to Barclays Partner Finance. 
Mrs As representative made a claim, on Mrs As behalf, to Barclays Partner Finance under 
section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in August 2020. It said that the points were 
misrepresented to Mrs A and her husband and the misrepresentations and sales practices 
adopted by the holiday company were unlawful, unconscionable, unreasonable and unfair. It 
said that the terms contained in the contract had created an unfair relationship between 
Barclays Partner Finance and Mrs A. It also said that there had been irresponsible lending 
and no proper assessment was done to assess Mrs As creditworthiness.
Barclays Partner Finance didnt respond to those claims so a complaint was made to this 
service. Mrs As complaint form says that a detailed letter, pursuant to sections 75 and 140A 
of the Consumer Credit Act was attached together with a copy of Barclays Partner Finances 
response. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs As complaint should be upheld. He wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale. He said that he hadnt 
seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mrs A and Barclays Partner Finance 
was unfair and he wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the 
relationship was unfair. He also said that he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that 
the lending was unaffordable for Mrs A. 
Mrs As representative, on behalf of Mrs A, has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman. It has provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday 
company and the unfair terms that it uses.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs As complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mrs A and her husband signed the purchase agreement in February 2013 and 
bought 61,500 holiday club membership points from the holiday company and Mrs A 
also signed a request to transfer to the holiday company two existing timeshare 
weeks;
they also signed a right of withdrawal form and Mrs A received information about the 
loan from Barclays Partner Finance and pre-contract credit information  I consider it 
to be likely that she also signed a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance but Ive not been provided with a copy of that agreement;
Mrs As representative made a claim to Barclays Partner Finance in August 2020 
under sections 140A and about irresponsible lending - a complaint was then made to 
this service and Mrs As complaint form says that a detailed letter pursuant to 
sections 75 and 140A was attached together with a copy of Barclays Partner 
Finances response - but the letter didnt refer to a claim under section 75 and Ive 
seen no evidence to show that Barclays Partner Finance had responded to the claim 
that had been made to it;
I consider that a claim was made to Barclays Partner Finance under section 140A but 
that no claim has been made to it under section 75 so in this decision Im only 
considering Barclays Partner Finances response to Mrs As section 140A claim and 
her claim about irresponsible lending and that no proper assessment of her 
creditworthiness was conducted;
Im not determining the outcome of Mrs As claim under section 140A as only a court 
would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner 
Finances response to her claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Mrs As representatives August 2020 letter says that the holiday company 
represented to Mrs A and her husband that: their existing timeshare company had 
been taken over by the holiday company; they had to exchange their week for points; 
if they didnt purchase, they would lose their membership; the points scheme would 
allow them to access resorts and accommodation worldwide; and that finance would 
be available to fund the purchase  and it says that those representations were 
untrue and misleading;
neither Mrs A nor her representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentation were made, the conversations 
that took place or the information that was provided to Mrs A and her husband before 
they entered into the purchase agreement;
I consider it to be clear from the documents that they signed that they were buying 
61,500 holiday club membership points, that Mrs A was transferring to the holiday 
company two existing timeshare weeks and that the purchase price was £4,500 
which Mrs A was paying using a loan from Barclays Partner Finance;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
represented to Mrs A and her husband that their existing timeshare company had 
been taken over by the holiday company, that they had to exchange their week for 
points and that if they didnt purchase, they would lose their membership; 
the holiday company may have told Mrs A and her husband that the points scheme 
would allow them to access resorts and accommodation worldwide but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that any such representation was 
untrue or misleading; Mrs A used a loan from Barclays Partner Finance to pay the purchase price for the 
points so it wouldnt have been untrue or misleading for the holiday company to say 
that finance would be available to fund the purchase;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the points were 
misrepresented to Mrs A and her husband by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the purchase agreement by any such misrepresentations;
Mrs As representatives August 2020 letter also says that the sales practices 
adopted by the holiday company were unlawful, unconscionable, unreasonable and 
unfair but Mrs A and her husband had signed the holiday companys right of 
withdrawal form which said that they had the right to withdraw from the purchase 
agreement within 14 calendar days without giving any reason - if they were 
concerned about the sales practices adopted by the holiday company and didnt want 
to buy the points, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have 
contacted either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance within the 
withdrawal period to withdraw from the purchase agreement and the loan agreement 
 but Ive seen no evidence to show that they did so;
Mrs A and her husband entered into the purchase agreement in February 2013 but 
Ive seen no evidence to show that they complained to the holiday company or 
Barclays Partner Finance about the sales practices that had been adopted by the 
holiday company until August 2020, more than seven years later, and if they were 
concerned about the sales practices that it had adopted I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have complained about it sooner than they did; 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs A and her husband 
were unduly pressured into entering into the purchase agreement, that Mrs A was 
unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable sales practices against them;
that letter also said that the terms contained in the contract had created an unfair 
relationship between Barclays Partner Finance and Mrs A, and Mrs As 
representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday 
company and the unfair terms that it uses;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mrs A and her husband 
and I consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances 
that the terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mrs A and 
Barclays Partner Finance;
Mrs As representative says that the lending by Barclays Partner Finance to Mrs A 
was irresponsible and that no proper assessment of Mrs As creditworthiness was 
conducted - but neither Mrs A nor her representative have provided detailed 
evidence about Mrs As financial position in February 2013 or to show that the loan 
wasnt affordable for her at that time;
Mrs As representative has provided information about the loan from Barclays Partner 
Finance and pre-contract credit information that Mrs A received and Barclays Partner 
Finance has provided a statement for Mrs As loan account dated in September 2023 
which shows that the loan was repaid in March 2023;the loan was made to Mrs A in February 2013 and Ive seen no evidence to show 
that she complained to Barclays Partner Finance that it was irresponsible for it to 
have lent to her or that it didnt properly assess her creditworthiness until August 
2020, more than seven years later, and if she was concerned about those issues I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have complained about them 
sooner than she did;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it was irresponsible for 
Barclays Partner Finance to have made the loan to Mrs A in February 2013 or that 
the loan wasnt affordable for her at that time;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs As relationship 
with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs A and 
Barclays Partner Finance in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt respond to the claim that was made to it in August 
2020 so I cant say that its response to Mrs As claim was fair and reasonable  but if 
it had properly responded to her claim I consider that it would have been fair and 
reasonable for it not to have upheld it;
I sympathise with Mrs A for the issues that she and her husband have had with their 
membership points but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to her any of the 
money that she's paid under the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs As complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 October 2023.
