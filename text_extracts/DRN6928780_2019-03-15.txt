K821x#15complaint
Miss S has complained  about  short-term loans granted to her by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid. Miss S says she couldnt afford these loans and that QuickQuid didnt 
take appropriate steps to check whether she could afford them when she took them out. 
background
QuickQuid agreed eight short-term loans for Miss S between December 2016 and 
March 2018. Each  loan was repayable over between one and two months. Miss S took out 
top-ups on some of these  loans. This is where she took out further borrowing under the 
same agreement, before paying  back the initial amount borrowed. She also refinanced  her 
fifth loan. Ive set out a summary  of lending below.

One of our adjudicators has looked into Miss Ss complaint  already  and recommended  the 
complaint be upheld in part. She thought  the checks QuickQuid  carried  out for loans 1  3 
were proportionate. But thought that the checks carried out from loan 4 onwards werent. 
And she thought  that had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks, it wouldve  seen  that 
loans 5  8, including the top-ups  on those loans and the refinance wouldve been  
unaffordable for Miss S, and would not have agreed to them.
Miss S raised no objections to the initial  view.  QuickQuid  responded further,  disagreeing with 
the assessment.  So the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision.  
As loans  1  3 no longer  seem in dispute,  my assessment will focus on the remaining loans, 
loans 4  8 and the subsequent  top-ups on these  loans, including the re-finance  on loan 5.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time.  
Ref: DRN69287802Our adjudicator, having looked  at everything, found  that QuickQuid didnt carry out 
proportionate checks for Miss Ss applications  from loan 4 onwards, including  the top-ups 
and refinances of those  loans. And he thought that had it done so, it wouldve likely  
understood that loans 4  8, and the subsequent top-ups and refinance,  wouldve been 
unaffordable for her. These  findings were set out in some detail in a view letter to the lender. 
QuickQuid initially said it carried out appropriate and proportionate affordability assessments, 
including validation of Miss Ss income and expenses before funding  all these loans. Its said 
it started implementing changes to affordability assessments in June  2014  and all the 
changes were completed by 28 February  2015.
And that starting  1 March  2015, before Miss S borrowed her first loan, it had implemented  an 
affordability review that was consistent with the FCA Handbook and was in place at the time 
it received authorisation by the FCA. And that its assessment was conducted properly and 
individually for each of these  applications.
QuickQuid raised this argument, in both its initial submissions, and in response  to the 
adjudicators assessment.  And this service has responded  to QuickQuid on this generic 
argument directly and through earlier final decisions.  So Im not going  to expand on this point 
any further here, though I have considered it alongside everything else in making my 
decision.
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the FCA guidance in how complaints are to be 
dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] 
which says that businesses procedures for complaint handling should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
And Im sure QuickQuid  is by now aware,  that our job is to look not only into the rules  and 
regulations set by the regulator  at the time of borrowing but also the law, good  industry  
practice and all the available evidence and arguments to help us decide whether we think 
what QuickQuid has done is fair and reasonable. And in this particular case  I don't think it 
was right to provide Miss S with some of the loans she borrowed from 2015  onwards.
So my decision will focus on the specifics of Miss Ss complaint and what  both parties have 
said about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Miss S borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in 
mind the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business (PRIN) and its Consumer 
Credit Sourcebook  (CONC),  I would expect a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
Ref: DRN69287803expect QuickQuid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship
So turning  to Miss Ss case,  at the time she took out loan 4, shed been borrowing from 
QuickQuid for around five months. And shed seemed to have been  unable to free herself of 
the need to take out short -term credit over this period. And for the most part, she was taking  
out new loans,  within around two weeks from settling her previous loans. 
Miss S had declared a monthly net income  of around £1,050 at this time, as well as monthly  
outgoings of around £575.  And the highest  monthly repayment on this new loan wouldve 
increased these  outgoings by a further  £248.  Given the size of the repayments  due in relation 
to the monthly  income Miss S declared,  I think proportionate checks wouldve included 
QuickQuid looking specifically into whether Miss S owed any monies to any other short-term 
lenders, to satisfy  itself she could afford  to make the repayments on this loan sustainably. 
However, looking at the evidence  on file, I cant see Miss S owed any monies  to any other 
short-term lenders at this time. So I think QuickQuid was entitled to rely on the remaining 
information Miss S provided when she applied, which suggested she had a disposable 
monthly income of around £475.  So I think it was reasonable of QuickQuid to have 
concluded that loan 4, with a highest monthly  repayment of around £248,  wouldve been 
sustainably affordable for her, and therefore I dont think it was wrong  in agreeing  to this loan. 
Miss S took out her fifth loan just over three  weeks after settling loan 4, and shed  now been 
borrowing from QuickQuid for around  eight  months at this point, taking  out loans that were 
intended to be used for short term use. 
Given the amount  of times Miss S had borrowed  from QuickQuid, and how regularly shed 
done so, I think  from this point on, proportionate  checks wouldve included QuickQuid 
building a full picture of Miss Ss financial  circumstances,  and verifying the information it was 
given before agreeing to lend to her further.  So Ive gone on to look at what  I think  
QuickQuid wouldve found out, had it carried out proportionate checks  from loan 5 onwards. 
At the point Miss S applied for loan 5, she again  declared a net monthly  income of around 
£1,050 and monthly outgoings of around  £575. But had QuickQuid carried  out a full review  of 
her finances  at this stage,  I think it wouldve seen she was actually  earning  less than shed 
declared, and that her income was closer  to £950 a month.
A full review  of Miss Ss finances wouldve also shown QuickQuid, that her monthly 
outgoings were  almost £800  a month. This included around £400 on rent, £100 on food, and 
around £300 across  her council tax, utility bills, tv, mobile phone costs, and her travel 
expenses. So it wouldve  seen that her disposable monthly income  was therefore around 
£150, which was insufficient to meet the highest  monthly repayment on loan 5 of £188.  So 
as a responsible  lender I dont think it wouldve agreed to loan 5 knowing this.
Ref: DRN69287804The top-ups  and refinance  of loan 5 increased  Miss Ss highest monthly repayment on this 
loan further again. So for the same  reasons  I think it shouldnt have approved  loan 5, I dont 
think it shouldve agreed to loans 5a or 5b either.
Miss S finished paying loan 5 towards  the end of November 2017,  and on 1 December 2017,  
approached QuickQuid again  for further borrowing. This pattern of repaying a loan, and 
taking out a further loan shortly after, continued  through the remainder of her borrowing with 
QuickQuid, and Miss S also took out one top-up on loan 6, and two top-ups on loans 7 and 8. 
Throughout this time,  Miss S continued declaring  a monthly income of between  £1,050 to 
£1,100, and reported monthly outgoings  of between £575 and £636 a month. However,  
proportionate checks wouldve  shown QuickQuid, that during this time, while  Miss Ss 
monthly incomed  did range around  this figure (£1,014 - £1,083) her monthly  outgoings were  
actually higher than disclosed and ranged from between £799  - £1,025 a month. And this 
meant that across the three applications for loans 6  8, Miss Ss disposable monthly income  
was actually around; £214 for loan 6; £55 for loan 7; and £154 for loan 8.
The highest  monthly repayments across  loans 6  8 were £316,  £61 and £248  respectively. 
So proportionate checks wouldve revealed  to QuickQuid, that loans 6  8 would not have 
been sustainably  affordable for Miss S, and as a responsible lender, I dont think it wouldve 
agreed to these loans  knowing  this. 
The top-ups  Miss S took out across loans 6  8 increased her monthly expenditure further,  
with the largest  monthly repayment due increasing, as each top-up was approved.  So for the 
same reasons I dont  think QuickQuid  shouldve agreed to loans 6  8, I also think  it should 
not have approved the subsequent top-ups on these loans  either. 
Ref: DRN69287805what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
For the reasons  outlined  above, I think QuickQuid shouldnt have agreed to loans 5  8 for 
Miss S, or any of the top-ups and re-finances on these loans. So it needs to refund  all of the 
interest and charges Miss S paid towards  these.
Specifically, it should:
refund the interest and charges paid for the loans it agreed  between September  2017  
and March 2018, and all top-ups and re-finances on these  loans (loans 5  8b)
pay interest on these  refunds at 8% simple from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement
remove any adverse  information about these  loans  from Miss Ss credit file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss S a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Miss Ss complaint in part.
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC trading  as QuickQuid to put things right as described  
above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 April 2019
