The complaint
Mr A has complained about a number of loans he took from Gain Credit LLC whilst trading 
as Lending Stream. Mr A says Gain Credit lent to him irresponsibly.  
What happened
Mr A was given 15 loans by Gain Credit between September 2010 and July 2018. The loans 
were all to be repaid in instalments, over five or six months. The principal sum borrowed 
varied from £115 to £1,100.  
An overview of Mr A's borrowing is as follows:

Mr A has complained that he had other outstanding loans and credit commitments at the 
time he borrowed from Gain Credit. And that all the loans hed taken from Gain Credit have 
compounded his serious financial problems.
One of our investigators looked into Mr As complaint. Based on the evidence hed seen, he 
didn't think that Gain Credit had been wrong to provide any of the loans.
Mr A didnt agree with this assessment and asked for an Ombudsman to review the matter. 
So the complaint has been passed to me to resolve.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending  including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) was the regulator when Mr A initially borrowed from Gain 
Credit. Later on this changed to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The relevant rules 
and guidance set out by the OFT and the FCA were similar. 
Gain Credit needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. This 
means that it had to carry out proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr A could repay the 
loans sustainably. These checks could take into account a number of different things, such 
as the loan amount, the repayment amounts, the consumers income and expenditure and 
his overall financial circumstances. But there was no set list of checks that Gain Credit had 
to do.
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But I've also considered if there were any other factors that 
might indicate that Gain Credit should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish 
whether continued lending was sustainable for Mr A.
 Such factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,  
unsustainable). 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context and what it means for Mr As complaint.
Mr A took 15 loans over 8 years, but there were significant gaps between some of the loans, 
so Ive considered whether any of these gaps were long enough to constitute a break in the 
lending. There were gaps of about:
6 months between Mr A paying off loan 2 and taking loan 3;
20 months between loans 4 and 5; 
15 months between loans 7 and 8; and 
9 months between loans 12 and 13.
I think the length of each of these gaps was such that Gain Credit might reasonably have 
considered each time that any problems that had led Mr A to take the previous loans had 
now been resolved. So each gap represented a clean break in lending. I think it was 
reasonable for the lender to treat Mr A as it would a new customer, each time a new chain 
of lending began. So I have considered Mr As 15 loans over 8 years as 5 distinct chains of 
lending.
Gain Credit carried out some checks before it gave each of the loans to Mr A. This included 
asking him for information about his income and expenditure and carrying out some credit 
checks. With the exception of loan 12 which I explain below, I think in the main, the checks 
Gain Credit carried out were reasonable and proportionate - given the amount it was lending 
to Mr A each time, in comparison with his income, and the number of loans agreed in each 
chain of lending. 
Mr A has told us he thinks Gain Credit should have carried out better checks, such as asking 
to see his bank statements. And that if it had done so, the lender would have discovered that 
he had other debts and that the loans were unaffordable for him. 
But I think the amounts that Mr A needed to repay in relation to these loans were relatively 
modest compared with the income he had declared. And given what Mr A had told Gain 
Credit about his circumstances, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for the lender to 
ask him for the amount of information that would be needed to show the lending was 
unsustainable, before agreeing the loans. I think it was reasonable for Gain Credit to make 
its lending decision each time based on the information Mr A had provided and what it found 
in its checks. And with the exception of loan 12, I dont think Mr As lending reached the point 
in any of the 5 chains of lending where I think Gain Credit ought to have been independently 
verifying the information he was providing about his finances by, for example, asking to see 
copies of his bank statements. 
I appreciate that Mr A says his financial situation was much worse, and that he was in 
serious debt with other creditors. But this doesnt appear to be something he shared with 
Gain Credit when he applied for the loans, or something that what I consider to be 
proportionate checks would have uncovered at the time. 
Loan 12
Loan 12 was the fifth loan in a repeating sequence. I think Gain Credit should reasonably 
have undertaken a more thorough check (such as asking to see bank statements), before 
agreeing to this loan - to satisfy itself that Mr A could meet his ongoing repayments sustainably. So I have looked carefully at Mr As bank statements for the 3 months prior to 
him taking loan 12  to see what the lender might have found, had it reviewed these 
statements. 
The statements show that Mr A had some borrowing from other short-term lenders at the 
time. But he generally stayed near or within his overdraft limit, which suggests he was 
managing his account carefully. He was also making regular payments into an ISA which 
would reasonably have given a lender confidence that this consumer may have savings with 
which he could sustainably repay his loan. There is no apparent evidence on the bank 
statements of serious gambling nor is there a significant number of returned requests for 
payment  both of which might have suggested to the lender that the consumer was facing 
severe financial difficulties.
I accept that Mr A has told us about his financial problems, but I have to consider what the 
lender would have discovered at the time, if it had reviewed his bank statements, and 
whether this should reasonably have led it to conclude that it ought to decline his application 
for lending.  I cannot fairly say, even if Gain Credit had carried out better checks before 
agreeing to provide loan 12, that the lender should have reasonably concluded from Mr As 
bank statements that he was having serious problems managing his money. Or that it should 
have concluded that it ought to decline his loan application. 
Mr A has provided us with information about how his complaint about another short-term 
lender has been upheld. But I have to consider the circumstances of this complaint about 
Gain Credit, and whether I think the lender did anything wrong or acted unfairly when it 
agreed to lend to Mr A. 
As I have explained above, the clean breaks in the pattern of lending throughout the 8 years 
meant that it was reasonable for this lender to treat Mr A as it would a new customer, each 
time a new chain of lending began. It seems to me that it would have been reasonable for 
Gain Credit to conclude that Mr A was largely using these loans in line with the purpose of 
this type of lending  to cover a short term, emergency need. And in the main, I dont think 
his repayment and borrowing behaviour should at any point have caused significant 
concerns for the lender or led it to conclude that he was facing serious financial problems.
I am sorry that Mr A has been struggling with financial problems, but I cant fairly conclude 
that Gain Credit shouldnt have provided any of the loans to him or that it lent to him 
irresponsibly.
My final decision
For the reasons I have explained above, I dont uphold Mr As complaint or make any award 
against Gain Credit LLC.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 August 2020.
