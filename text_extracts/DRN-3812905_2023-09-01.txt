The complaint
Mr G has complained that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) has refused to refund him money 
he lost as the result of a scam.
What happened
Mr G was looking to invest money and found an advertisement online for CoinFx. They 
claimed to be specialists in crypto trading and as this was of interest to Mr G, he completed 
a contact form. CoinFx contacted Mr G and he was convinced to transfer funds into 
MoonPay and then once there, the funds were used to buy crypto. The crypto was then 
transferred to CoinFx. The investments that were made appeared legitimate. Mr G was then 
convinced by CoinFx that investing more would maximise his potential profit.
Mr G made the following debit card payments totalling £52,806.22 to Moonpay from his 
HSBC account as set out below. These funds were then sent on to CoinFx

Mr G later attempted to withdraw his funds from CoinFx but he was unable to do so. At this 
point Mr G realised that he had been scammed. I issued a provisional decision on 
21 July 2023 saying the following:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The circumstances of this complaint are not in dispute and the evidence provided by both Mr 
G and HSBC set out what happened. What is in dispute is whether HSBC should refund any 
of the money Mr G lost because of the scam.
Mr G has accepted he authorised the payments he made to CoinFx, so the starting point 
here is that Mr G is responsible for making the payments. However, banks and other 
Payment Services Providers (PSPs) do have a duty to protect against the risk of financial 
loss due to fraud and/or to undertake due diligence on large transactions to guard against 
money laundering.
In relation to the first three payments, I think that these payments were not so unusual for 
HSBC to intervene given their size. I say this because Mr G had in the past made 
transactions of a similar size.
That said, the fourth transaction I believe should have been considered unusual. It was a 
larger amount and prior to the first three payments. Mr G had not transferred money to 
crypto exchanges prior to this. I therefore think that him making a fourth transaction in a 
relatively short time to a new international payee should really have prompted HSBC to 
intervene.
At this stage, HSBC should have stepped in and asked Mr G in depth questions to find out 
what the payments related to. Had HSBC stepped in at this point, I think its likely Mr G would 
have explained the reason he was suddenly making a number of large payments from his 
card within a relatively short space of time.
HSBC would likely have discovered that Mr G was allowing a third party access to his 
computer and that the funds sent to Moonpay were intended to be converted to crypto and 
forwarded to a different trading firm. This has all the hallmarks of a typical investment scam. 
Im satisfied that a warning to Mr G from his trusted bank would have probably alerted him to 
the common issues arising in relation to cryptocurrency scams, which in turn would have 
revealed the truth behind the CoinFxs representations. This would have probably stopped 
Mr G in his tracks. So, but for HSBCs failure to act on clear triggers of potential fraud or 
financial harm, Mr G probably wouldnt have continued to make the additional payments.Despite regulatory safeguards, there is a general principle that consumers must still take 
responsibility for their actions. In this case, I do not think that Mr G was to blame for what 
happened and I havent seen anything to suggest that he had foreseen the risk of this sort of 
harm occurring, or indeed any harm. I do not think Mr G could have foreseen the risk that the 
company he was dealing with was in fact scammers and the trading account he was viewing 
was likely to be a simulation. I also cant see there were any credible warnings in place 
about the CoinFx at the time Mr G started making the payments. So, in the circumstances, I 
do not think it would be fair to reduce compensation on the basis that Mr G should share 
blame for what happened.
I have considered whether HSBC could have recovered the first three payments. As these 
payments were made using his debit card, the only way to recover the funds would be via 
the chargeback process. However, as these transactions were to purchase crypto for Mr G 
in the first instance and Mr G did receive the crypto (before he then transferred it on), I dont 
think a chargeback would have been successful.
Finally I have considered the interest rate that should apply to the award. In this instance Mr 
G has explained that the funds he lost during this scam came from two main sources an ISA 
and a Savings account. Had he been prevented from sending money to the scammer I 
believe that he would have on balance left the funds in these accounts Mr G has confirmed 
this. I therefore believe that it would be reasonable to intend asking HSBC to add interest to 
this award at the rates of the respective accounts. From looking at the transactions it seems 
as if payment 4 to 8 were from the HSBC savings account so the rate of interest applied to 
the award should be in line with what he would have achieved had the funds remained in 
that account. In relation to transactions 9 to 18 these seem to be from an ISA from a 
separate provider. Looking at the website for this provider both when the transaction 
happened and currently I can see that the interest rate applicable to the instant access ISAs 
started at 0.4% and currently is 4.0%. Without wanting to unpick exactly when the interest 
rate changed at every point I propose to use an average rate of 2.2%.
Putting things right
I currently intend for HSBC UK Bank Plc, trading as HSBC Bank to do the following:
1) Refund transactions 4 to 18.
2) Pay simple interest per year on payments 4 to 8 based on what he would have earned in   
interest had the money remained in his HSBC savings account. This should be calculated 
from the date each payment was made, until the date of settlement (less any tax properly 
deductible).
3) Pay simple interest on payments 9 to 18 at 2.2% per year, calculated from the date each 
payment was made, until the date of settlement (less any tax properly deductible).
In response to my provisional decision Mr G accepted my findings. HSBC responded with a 
number of points which I will summarise:
It does not believe that in an intervention call Mr G would not likely have disclosed 
exactly what he was planning on doing with his funds.
Mr G would not likely have changed his mind had an intervention call occurred as he 
had done his own research
Mr G was unsure that he had been scammed until after the scam had concluded 
therefore why would he not have continued despite a warning from HSBCMr Gs refund if merited should have a 50% reduction for contributary negligence the 
reasons HSBC gave included that he invested large amounts before receiving a 
return, investing large amounts in themselves carries risk so Mr G should have been 
aware that what he was doing could cause him financial harm and he was promised 
unrealistic returns.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
HSBCs points can be broken down to two main concerns whether an intervention by HSBC 
would have changed what happened and did Mr G contribute to his own losses. I would like 
to stress that I have consider all points raised by both parties even if I do not directly address 
each one individually.
In relation to whether an intervention call would have made a difference. Firstly, I would like 
to consider whether had such a call occurred would it have been likely that HSBC would 
have discovered that Mr G was being scammed. 
I would like to highlight that HSBC know more than a consumer about what is and isnt likely 
a scam. Had HSBC intervened and asked the kind of probing questions we think it 
reasonable for them to have asked they likely would have discovered that Mr G was allowing 
someone to invest on his behalf whilst being in control of his computer. HSBC says that the 
use of remote access software was not mentioned in the initial complaint, but I can see that 
it was. Regardless of this though, even had it not been used, and I think on balance it was, 
merely establishing that Mr G was buying crypto to forward on to a third party to trade would 
have been enough for HSBC to have identified this as likely a scam. HSBC have said that 
Mr G may not have been forthcoming about what he was doing during a call with it. But I 
cant see why it thinks that Mr G would not have told HSBC what he had been doing, there 
are no indication that Mr G was coached on what to say during an interaction with HSBC and 
Mr G has been forthcoming during the entire complaint process. 
Had HSBC given a specific warning that what Mr G was doing had the hallmarks of a scam I 
think he would have heeded it. After all HSBC are the experts in such matters and a warning 
from his trusted bank would have carried more weight than the research he had already 
done prior to the transactions in question and would likely have stopped the scam from that 
point. At the very least had HSBC said that the profit he thought he had earned was likely a 
simulation it would have prompted Mr G to do general research on the common features of 
crypto scams and this in turn would have stopped him from proceeding further.
In relation to a deduction for contributary negligence. Whilst I accept that all investing carries 
risk, I am satisfied that the research done prior to Mr G investing was not unreasonable. 
There were no credible warnings about CoinFx at the time he started investing. The returns 
did not seem to be guaranteed rather he seems to have been told that he could make a high 
rate of return if he invested quickly. Mr G would not have known that the returns that he was 
getting were in fact simulated and this led to him continuing to invest more funds. I dont 
find this unreasonable. Or that it merits a deduction from the refund.Putting things right
HSBC UK Bank Plc should do the following:
1) Refund transactions 4 to 18.
2) Pay simple interest per year on payments 4 to 8 based on what he would have earned in   
interest had the money remained in his HSBC savings account. This should be calculated 
from the date each payment was made, until the date of settlement (less any tax properly 
deductible).
3) Pay simple interest on payments 9 to 18 at 2.2% per year, calculated from the date each 
payment was made, until the date of settlement (less any tax properly deductible).
My final decision
For the reasons given above, my decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and require 
HSBC UK Bank Plc, to put matters right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 September 2023.
