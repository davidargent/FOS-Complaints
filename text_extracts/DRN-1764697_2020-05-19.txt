The complaint
Mrs G says S.D. Taylor Limited (trading as Loans at Home - referred to in my decision as 
"LAH") lent to her irresponsibly. Mrs G has also complained about correspondence she 
received in relation to the arrears on her account.
Mrs G is represented by a family member.
What happened
LAH provided Mrs G with 20 home credit loans between December 2013 and April 2019. I've 
summarised some of the information LAH provided about the lending below.

An adjudicator considered the complaint and thought it should be upheld in respect of loans 
2 to 20. LAH asked for and was granted additional time to respond to the adjudication but 
hasn't sent us anything since. As LAH didn't accept the adjudication, the complaint was 
passed to me to decide.
Mrs G didn't object to the adjudicator's recommendation to not uphold the complaint in 
respect of loan 1. As such, my decision will focus on the remaining loans.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term and high cost lending - including all of the relevant rules, 
guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
LAH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs G could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that LAH should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that LAH was required to establish 
whether Mrs G could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Gs complaint.
Starting with loan 2 - I understand the loan had a weekly repayment of £20, which would've 
been paid alongside the £20 weekly repayment for loan 1.
I've considered whether £40 a week was a sustainable repayment in Mrs G's circumstances 
- and I don't think it was. As I understand it, Mrs G was retired and living in sheltered 
accommodation. Her only income was from the state pension, pension credits and disability 
living allowance. From the evidence I've seen this came to about £600 a month at the time of 
loan 2 - or about £140 per week. Given Mrs G's circumstances, LAH ought to have taken 
steps to ensure it had accurate information and evidence about Mrs G's income.None of this means Mrs G wasn't capable of making her own decisions (or that LAH ought to 
have suspected this) - that's not what I'm suggesting. But given Mrs G's circumstances, it 
was important that LAH's affordability checks were proportionate to the risk of harm that 
could be caused by loans which were not sustainably affordable.
The total of the repayments Mrs G had to make to LAH following the approval of loan 2 was 
about 28% of her income - leaving her with about £100 per week to meet all of her other 
living costs, including food, healthcare and other financial commitments. These other 
commitments included £24 a week towards another home loan with a different provider.
I think LAH would've been aware of Mrs G's other credit commitments had it carried out 
reasonable and proportionate checks. And it would've seen Mrs G's disposable weekly 
income was very limited. I think this means it was unlikely Mrs G could've repaid loan 2 
without undue difficulty.
So, having looked at Mrs G's circumstances at the time, I don't think loan 2 was sustainably 
affordable and I'm upholding the complaint about it.
Loans 3, 4 and 5 were all taken out on the same day as a previous loan was repaid. And 
from the loan balance histories I've seen, part of the balance of the outstanding loans was 
repaid with the funds from these new loans. So Mrs G was - at least in part - refinancing 
existing debt. This - and that Mrs G was on a fixed income - suggests it was unlikely Mrs G 
was experiencing any kind of cyclical shortfall in her income.
Mrs G's income, unsurprisingly given her circumstances, didn't really change during this 
period, although by March 2015 it may have increased to around £170 per week. 
Throughout this period, Mrs G continued to have loans from other home credit providers, 
with repayments of £20-£24 per week. So I think reasonable and proportionate affordability 
checks would've continued to show that loans 3 to 5 were not sustainably affordable, given 
the size of the repayments, Mrs G's existing credit commitments, her other living costs and 
limited income. I'm therefore upholding the complaint about loans 3 to 5.
I've additionally noted that there are times during this period when Mrs G's bank statements 
(which LAH says it sometimes checked) contain a significant number of gambling 
transactions. For example, in February 2015 (before loan 5) I can see over 25 transactions 
totalling more than £300 - a substantial amount relative to Mrs G's income, which might help 
explain why she needed to return so regularly for additional home credit. Many of the loan 
applications suggest LAH checked Mrs G's bank statements. If it didn't do this for loans 3 to 
5, it ought to have done so, and I think it likely would've seen these transactions and 
would've had further reason to doubt Mrs G could repay these loans sustainably.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of LAHs lending history with Mrs G with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which LAH should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so LAH should have realised that it shouldn't 
have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Gs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point LAH ought to have realised Mrs G was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Mrs G had been indebted to LAH for 20 months and had taken out new 
loans every time another loan was repaid. So LAH ought to have realised it was more 
likely than not Mrs G was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her 
previous loans was leaving in her finances and that Mrs Gs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.From loan 6 onwards Mrs G was continually provided with new loans on the same 
day as settling previous loans.
Mrs G wasn't making any real inroads into reducing or ending her indebtedness 
to LAH. Loan 20 was taken out more than five years after Mrs Gs first. And it was for 
a larger amount. Mrs G appears to have essentially refinanced many of her loans (at 
least in part) and so has paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
LAH over an extended period.
I think that Mrs G lost out because LAH continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs G's indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mrs G borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding the complaint about loans 6 to 20, as well as 2 to 5, and LAH should 
put things right.
I've also considered Mrs G's complaint about the arrears correspondence she received. 
From what I've seen, I think these were statutory notices LAH was obliged to send. But in 
any event, LAH said it wouldn't send any more of these in its final response (because it was 
writing the debt off). So I think that aspect of the complaint was fairly resolved by LAH's final 
response and I won't award any additional compensation - although I do understand why 
Mrs G would've found this correspondence upsetting.
Putting things right
LAH shouldn't have given Mrs G loans 2 to 20.
A) LAH should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs G towards interest, 
fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything LAH has already refunded.
B) LAH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs G 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs G originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) LAH may  if it chooses to  use the total of A plus B to repay any principal which it 
has written off.
D) LAH should pay any remaining refund to Mrs G. If there is no refund left and still a 
balance outstanding made up of written-off principal, it would not be fair for LAH to pursue 
this further.
E) LAH should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Mrs Gs credit file in 
relation to loans 2 to 5. The overall pattern of Mrs Gs borrowing for loans 6 to 20 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so LAH should remove these loans entirely 
from Mrs Gs credit file. If LAH have sold any of the loans it should ask the debt purchaser to 
do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to deduct tax from this interest. LAH should give Mrs 
G a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decisionFor the reasons given above, I uphold Mrs G's complaint. S.D. Taylor Limited must put 
things right by taking the steps set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 June 2020.
