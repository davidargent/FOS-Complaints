K821x#15complaint
Mr B says complains that Gain  Credit  LLC, trading as Lending  Stream (Lending Stream)  
lent to him irresponsibly.  
background
I attach my provisional decision dated 20 February  2019, which  forms part of this final 
decision and should be read in conjunction  with it. In my provisional decision I explained why 
I intended to uphold Mr Bs complaint in part. I invited both parties to provide any further 
comments they may have  by 6 March 2019  before  I reached a further decision.
Mr B has agreed with my provisional decision and has nothing  further to add. Lending 
Stream said on 6 March  2019 it would respond  by 13th March. I have received two 
acknowledgments to say the same thing. I have  received nothing further. 
my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
I am content  that Mr B has accepted my provisional decision. And as Lending Stream  has 
not provided any further arguments, I see no reason to alter the conclusions I reached  in my 
provisional decision on 20 February 2019.
I particularly draw Lending Streams attention to page 8 of this final determination which 
related to the events surrounding some  outstanding  loans in August 2018. As Lending 
Stream has not come  back  to explain further then I assume that it does not disagree. So for 
clarity I have  incorporated specific points in relation to Loans 26, 27 and 28 into the putting  
things right section of this final determination as my provisional findings said I would do 
unless additional  explanation was received.  
putting things right
I think it would be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of Mr Bs complaint for 
Lending Stream to put things right in the following way: 
refund  all the interest, fees and charges for Loan 4 and Loans 9 to 28; and
add interest at 8% per year* simple on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid by Mr B to the date of final resolution of this complaint; 
write off the principal  balance for Loans 26, 27 and 28 if not already done;
remove from Mr Bs credit file adverse payment information for Loans 4 and 9; 
remove from Mr Bs credit file all reference  to loans 10 to 28.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN05711932my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision  dated 20 February 2019, 
I uphold Mr Bs complaint  in part. 
Gain Credit LLC,  trading as Lending  Stream should  put things right for Mr B in the way 
I have set out in that provisional  decision which is attached and forms part of this final 
determination. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  on or before 15 April 2019.

background
This complaint is about  28 instalment loans provided  to Mr B between  July 2011 and December  2017. 
All of them were structured  as six consecutive monthly payments. A table setting out brief details 
appears in the annexe to this provisional  decision.  I will refer to the loans  according to the numberings 
on that table. 
Mr B first complained to Lending Stream by telephone on 7 February  2018. Lending Stream  gave 
consent for this service to consider Loans 1 and 2 along  with the rest.
A repayment plan was set up late January 2018 for the last three loans. Mr B made payments in line 
with that plan up to the end March 2018 and then he requested that the account  be suspended while 
his complaint was being considered at this Service.
Mr B has sent us a lot of detail and I summarise his complaint here: 
Lending Stream was irresponsible because of the volume,  frequency and amount borrowed;
it ought  to have  identified that he was reliant on the loans and ceased lending;
Mr B says that neither the employment, income or credit score factors  mitigate  the fact that 
28 loans is excessive
Mr B says he became trapped in a debt spiral.
Lending Stream has explained to Mr B that it carried  out rigorous affordability assessments and the 
nature of its product  instalment loans  repayable over six months  meant that the monthly sums 
were lower. It explained that its loan applications process captured Mr Bs self-declared income,  
expenditure, employment/place of work  details. 
It said to Mr B that It was imperative that details furnished by you were correct,  so we could ensure  
that we satisfy our standard affordability checks to measure  if your loan applications met our lending 
criteria or not. It considered that the loans had been paid out correctly. 
One of our adjudicators  has looked at this complaint in detail several times. Her first opinion in August 
2018 was that lending Stream should put things right for Mr B in relation to Loans 3, 4 and 9 to 28. 
At first Lending Stream  accepted  this and said that it would do as our adjudicator asked. It changed its 
mind. I say more about  this in the body of my provisional  decision.  As Lending Stream changed  its 
mind and then chose  to dispute our adjudicators findings then our adjudicator  reviewed  some details 
and in her third opinion in mid-September 2018 made a slight alteration: she no longer  recommended 
that the part of the complaint relating to Loan 3 be upheld.
Mr B accepted this third opinion  and that the redress being recommended by our adjudicator  related  
to Loans 4 and Loans 9 to 28. From this I do not consider that Loans 1 to 3 and 5 to 8 are in dispute. 
So I do not plan to review them here.
Lending Streams main  points relate to Loans 9 to 28. Lending Stream has asked our adjudicator for 
more detailed reasons for upholding the complaint  specifically in relation to Loans 12 to 28. It has 
asked for affordability  assessments in detail for each loan. It says that Mr Bs early  repayment of 
almost all of the loans  was an indication  that Mr B was not dependant on a continuous  line of loan 
borrowings. 
Lending Stream also reminded our adjudicator  that these were six month instalment loans and from 
that the individual repayments were more likely  affordable. And it says that it verified Mr Bs credit 
obligations with a third party as part of its affordability assessments. 
Ref: DRN05711934Our adjudicator explained further in her fourth  opinion  and explained  that the pattern of borrowing was 
such that it was not sustainable for Mr B. And that it was clear that Mr B was not using these high-cost  
short term instalment loans in the manner  they were intended to be used. It ought  to have raised 
concerns with Lending Stream and it ought to have  looked to see if these series  of loans over an 
extended period of time were sustainable.  
Our adjudicator considered  that the complaint remained unresolved and that it ought to be passed to 
an ombudsman for a decision. 
Following which Lending  Stream added that it wanted an ombudsmans decision on this case in order 
for this service to articulate the rationale  on certain  arguments so that it may accurately and 
effectively learn  from decisions. Lending Stream is asking for this decision in order to understand 
how the FOS perceives responsible and proper use of lending products offered in the HCSTC space. 
HCSTC refers  to high-cost  short term credit. 
In future I refer Lending  Stream to the regulations governing it and to this Services  website and its 
technical pages on which are further details  on the regulations, guidance,  and our approach to these 
types of complaints.
The result  is that this complaint has been passed to me for a decision.  
my provisional  findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide  what  is fair and reasonable  in 
the circumstances of this complaint. I have taken into account the law, any relevant  regulatory  rules 
and good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
Before lending  money  to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand whether  
the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner without it 
adversely impacting on their financial  situation.  
A lender  should gather  enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on the 
lending. Although the guidance and rules  themselves did not set out compulsory checks, they did list 
a number of things  a lender could take into account before agreeing  to lend. The key element  was 
that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to take into account a number of different things,  
including how much  was being lent and when the sum being borrowed was due to be repaid. 
original acceptance of our adjudicators opinion
I have asked Lending Stream to give details about the fact that its representative emailed this service 
to accept our adjudicators first opinion. But it has not provided me with all the information  I have 
requested about this. 
What I do know from both parties is that on or about 28 August 2018  Lending Stream  altered  Mr Bs 
account status  to show that the last three loans were closed and that nothing further was due to be 
paid. And Mr B has told me that his credit file has been amended and I think  that the amendments  
have been done to reflect the original adjudicators recommendations as to what Lending Stream  
should do to put things right.
 
So it looks as if Lending Stream has accepted that it got things wrong in relation to these loans and 
has started to comply with the recommendations to put things right.  
Without further information  I cannot say more. And as the actions are to the benefit  of Mr B then there 
seems little point in delaying this provisional decision further in order to wait for information  which may 
be academic. But I do think that the implications  of these actions do need to be reflected in the 
redress section of this provisional decision which  is outlined below.  
Ref: DRN05711935Loan 4  first loan chain
This was the fourth loan in the first lending chain. Mr B applied for it on 7 July 2012 several months 
after repaying  Loan 3. This loan was for a much larger amount  £615 and was due to be repaid over 
six months. The highest  scheduled repayment  figure was £307 and it is that amount I have used in 
order to review Lending Streams assessment prior to lending.
At this stage I would have  expected Lending Stream to have used the information  it had from Mr B 
about his income and his expenditure and also made additional enquiries to see if he had any 
outstanding STL debt. I have checked this position from the information  we have received from and 
about Mr B. He had too much outstanding STL debt to make this instalment loan affordable. I am 
planning to uphold Mr Bs complaint in relation to loan 4.
second loan chain post 1 April 2014
From April 2014 lenders were regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and had to carry  
out an assessment of the creditworthiness  of an applicant/customer in accordance with the FCAs 
Consumer Credit  Sourcebook (CONC): CONC  5.2.1R  (1). 
Some of the CONC  provisions altered from 1 November  2018 and so the ones I refer to here are as 
they were at the time Mr B was applying for these loans  during the second loan chain  from 
September 2014. 
CONC 5 sets out a firms obligations in relation to responsible lending.  And CONC 6 sets out a firms 
obligations after a consumer has entered into a regulated  agreement.
A firm must consider  (a) the potential for the commitmentsto adversely impact the customers 
financial situation, taking  into account the information of which the firm is aware at the time 
theagreement is to be made; and (b) the ability  of the customer to make the repayments as they fall 
due... CONC 5.2.1R (2). 
The firm should take into account more than assessing the customers ability to repay the credit. 
CONC 5.3.1G. It ought  to take reasonable steps to assess the customers ability  to meet  repayments 
 in a sustainable  manner.  
Sustainable means that the applicant  is able to repay on time,  out of income and savings, without 
undue difficulties, and without having  to borrow to meet those repayments:  CONC 5.3.1G (6).
Examples in CONC 5.2.3G  are: the type and the amount of credit; the financial position of the 
applicant; the potential customers credit history; existing and future financial commitments and any 
future changes in circumstances  which  could  be reasonably expected to have a significant  financial  
adverse impact on the customer; And the FCAs rules and guidance made it clear that the 
information gathered needed to be enough to be able to reasonably assess  the sustainability  of the 
arrangement for the consumer.  
CONC also includes  guidance about proportionality  of assessments. CONC 5.2.4G(2) says:
A firm should consider what is appropriate in any particular circumstances dependent on, for example,  
the type and amount of credit being sought and the potential risks to the customer. The risk of credit 
not being  sustainable directly relates to the amount  of credit granted and the total charge for credit 
relative to the customers  financial situation
So I think the regulators requirements  are clear  that an assessment needed to be consumer-
focussed. It is not designed  to be solely an assessment on the risk to the lender of not recovering the 
loan money  to its satisfaction, but of the risk to the consumer of incurring financial difficulties  or 
experiencing significant adverse consequence as a result of the decision to lend. 
Ref: DRN05711936Loan 9
As I have outlined in the background section  of my decision, there does not seem to be a dispute in 
relation to Loans 5 to 8 and so here I deal with Loan 9. This was applied  for in February 2015 for £200 
repayable over six months and the highest scheduled  repayment  was £90. 
Lending Stream would have  known that its own earlier  loan (Loan 8) was outstanding  and so I have 
taken into account the repayment schedule for that loan and Mr B would have been contractually 
bound to repay  these as well.  
By this point in the lending relationship in the second loan chain I would have expected  Lending 
Stream to be carrying out proportionate checks which  would have verified his income, obtained 
detailed information  on Mr Bs regular outgoings and expenditure, regular  financial commitments, 
other STL debt and gain a comprehensive picture of Mr Bs financial situation. 
I say this because this would have  been  the fifth loan since September  2014, overlapped with Loan 8, 
would have extended his general indebtedness  with Lending Stream  and also was only two weeks 
after he had applied for Loan 8 which  was a large principal amount of £700.  So it may have seemed 
unusual that a customer  with an apparent good level of disposable income  was returning for 
additional loans so soon.  
I do not think  that Lending Stream did this comprehensive review.
I have spoken to Mr B and I have obtained  fresh sets of bank  statements as well as the ones which 
were made available  to our adjudicator. 
Mr B thinks that if Lending Stream had done more in-depth checks  it would have realised  his position 
and not lent to him. He has explained that sometimes the loan applications were  granted on-line  in 
about a minute and he thinks that the early  repayment pattern he had built up with Lending Stream 
may have contributed to an internal good standing record. He thinks  that this had an influence over 
the lending decisions.  
I do not have any evidence about Lending Streams internal processes to be able to make any finding 
on this last point raised by Mr B. But I have taken it into account as part of the application procedure 
experience from Mr Bs perspective. 
And I am aware  that CONC does envisage that a lender considering an application can look at the 
applicants borrowing history. But there is also a provision where  the lender should not allow a 
customer to enter into consecutive agreements  for HCSTC where the cumulative effect would be that 
the total amount  payable is unsustainable: CONC  6.7.22G.
I think  that this did become  the situation with Mr B  that the total amount payable in these 
consecutive (often overlapping) loans led to the total amount payable  being  unsustainable. 
What I have seen from Mr Bs bank  account transactions is that he was permanently  in an overdraft  
state on one account, spent money on betting and gaming regularly (usually on a daily basis)  and has 
told me that he had a gambling issue at the time.  I can see that some transactions  were  for £600 in a 
day. I can also see that Mr B took loans to repay other loans. An example  is that in January  2015 Mr 
B received  a loan which he used to repay  another  large  loan and several smaller debts including other 
payday lenders and credit  cards. 
Some aspects of Mr Bs finances have been explained to me and I am satisfied that some additional 
income he received was forwarded to a family member and so I discount  that as having any income 
element for Mr B.
Ref: DRN05711937I can see on the statements, and Mr B has explained to me, that often he borrowed from family 
members and where I can see regular repayments back to those family members, I have taken them  
into account.
His arrangement with his partner at the time was to pay to a joint House Account an agreed sum out 
of which the joint mortgage  and household  bills were  paid. I can see that £1,000 was paid out to that 
other account  regularly immediately after he received his salary around 23rd in each month.  The 
months of January and February 2015 were no different. 
On top of this I can see that Mr B was servicing  a long term loan costing him about  £320 a month and 
the new loan (referred to above  and used to pay down his debt) started to cost him about £222 each 
month from February 2015. He had other bills such as a mobile phone contract, credit file fee, 
account and overdraft charges, some food, insurance  and transport  costs.  Mr B has told me that he 
had a young family at the time.
Added to which Mr B had many other  payday  and instalment loan lender liability and seemed to be 
juggling payments  in and out as well as many gambling  transactions.  
I think  that if Mr B had been asked more  questions, had been asked for details of some transactions, 
and possibly  asked to show some bank statements then its likely  that all of these  points would have 
come to light. And additional  checks were warranted and in my view not carried  out by Lending 
Stream. 
gambling 
I make  no findings on whether Mr Bs expenditure on betting and gaming  was a leisure activity or a 
serious habit  forming  activity. But Mr B has told me that he considered  it was a problem at the time 
and has described it as such. And I can see from Mr Bs statements  that the sums involved were  not 
insubstantial. 
The checks were to be proportionate to a number  of factors, including  Mr Bs current financial 
situation and indications of present or past financial difficulties, as well as future  financial 
commitments. 
My view is that it would not be unreasonable to consider that many hundreds of pounds   sometimes 
thousands of pounds - being spent on gambling each  month would be a current financial situation to 
be taken into account. And its likely  that this could be a fairly strong indication  of present  financial 
difficulty. 
In addition, it is likely to mean that Mr B may have had an issue with repaying in a sustainable  
fashion within  the meaning of CONC. Gambling is highly  likely to lead to debt. And with a debt 
situation arising  out of, or contributed to by, gambling,  then a properly carried out affordability 
assessment was likely to lead a responsible lender to conclude that a loan was not affordable for an 
applicant in that situation.
At the stage where I think  that Lending Stream ought to have carried out a comprehensive review of 
Mr Bs financial situation  certainly from Loan 9 if not before - then I think  it was likely that Lending 
Stream would have become  aware of the gambling.  
So referring back  to Loan 9 in particular,  by the time that Mr B was credited  with Loan 9 on 27 
February 2015, Mr B had spent about £4,085 on betting and gaming and had received  from those 
websites about £2,180 which I take to be his winnings. This meant that his net loss was about  £1,900 
which was a large proportion of his net salary figure  about £2,347.  
Ref: DRN05711938I have considered whether,  if asked, Mr B would  have produced these  second set of statements in 
which most (not all) of these  gambling transactions appeared and were obvious. I am not sure 
whether he would or not. But the fact remains  that the responsibility was on the lender to carry out a 
proper borrower focussed affordability assessment and it seems clear to me that the level of detail 
I would have  expected at this point  in the lending  relationship was not asked for. And if it had been 
asked for and not produced by Mr B then Lending Stream would have been on notice that maybe  
there was more to investigate. 
So, taking all aspects and circumstances in the round, then I do not think  that the proper  assessment 
was carried out by Lending Stream. And that if it, had I think that Lending Streams decision in relation  
to Mr Bs application for Loan 9 would  likely be different. 
I am planning  to uphold Mr Bs complaint for Loan 9.
Loan 10 onwards. 
I repeat my provisional findings in relation  to Loan  9. And I refer to the CONC provisions set out 
above which are some of those applicable  to a lender like Lending Stream.  Many other equally 
applicable provisions are not reproduced  here. 
In addition to assessing the affordability of each individual loan provided to Mr B by Lending Stream,  
I also think  its fair and reasonable  to look at the overall pattern of lending. Bearing in mind the short-
term purpose of this type of credit and the relevant  rules, guidance and good  industry practice  at the 
time, there  likely comes  a point at which  a responsible lender would question  whether continuing to 
offer further HCSTC to a customer  who appears to be persistently reliant upon the loans was 
unsustainable or otherwise  harmful.
The Lending Stream  submissions include the fact that instalment loans reduce  the repayment costs in 
principle by structuring  them as repayments across  six months. 
I can see with Mr B that the instalment loans  overlapped  which means that Lending Stream was 
receiving applications for loans from Mr B when  others were  open still. 
So this does  demonstrate  to me that  
a) Lending Stream  would  have been  very aware  of Mr Bs existing  indebtedness to it from its own 
records and aware of the future repayments due from Mr B; and 
b) the combined repayment  sums  due going  forward  would  inevitably increase with the approval of 
additional loans when earlier loans  remained  outstanding; and 
c) there was a high likelihood  that the principal sums lent to Mr B would have  been redirected  back  to 
Lending Stream to repay instalments coming up on the other loans. 
An example is where in January  2016  when Mr B was applying for Loan 16 Mr B had five other loans 
still outstanding  Loans 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15.  He applied for £300 and was approved for £350.  He 
would have had six loans outstanding to Lending Stream  just after this Loan 16 was approved. 
Mr B repaid several of these on 20 January 2016 and then took another  loan from Lending Stream on 
4 February 2016, then repaid several other loans  on 10 February 2016.  On 19 February  2016 Mr B 
applied for Loan 18 which was approved. Loan 18 remained open for almost the full six month loan 
agreement period and closed in August  2016,  but during that time Mr B took three other loans (Loans  
19-21) in May and July 2016. 
From the table set out at the end of this decision then that pattern is demonstrated and can be seen to 
have been prevalent for most of the years Mr B was indebted to Lending Stream.
Ref: DRN05711939The greater the number and frequency  of loans and where these are over a longer period  of time,  
then I think it more thorough checks ought to be carried out. There  is a risk that repeated financing  of 
loans may signal that the borrowing has become (or was becoming) unsustainable  for that particular 
customer. Here, I mean Mr B. 
From mid-September 2016  Mr Bs situation had altered in that he had sold an asset (house),  used 
that capital to repay  Loans 19-21, and the funding for his family from his salary  altered. I have  
checked both sets of statements beyond that date and the gambling continued.  And I refer back to the 
detailed points I have  made in relation  to his gambling issues. I have seen that these transactions 
continued at similar levels (often several  hundred pounds each month, sometimes more)  for most of 
the months during  these  years.  
Repaying Lending  Streams loans out of Mr Bs net salary was not going  to be sustainable for him. In 
other words its likely he would have difficulty meeting these combined  repayments without having to 
borrow further  or cut back on his other spending. 
Lending Stream continued  to agree  loans for Mr B throughout 2016 and 2017,  some of which were 
overlapping. It did not do any more  when assessing the risk to Mr B in agreeing these  loans  than it 
had done when he had applied  for the preceding ones. Given the frequent and continuous  pattern of 
the lending, I think Lending Stream should have continued to look further than it did into Mr Bs 
circumstances when he continued to apply for loans. 
I do not think  Lending Stream gathered  enough  information  to reasonably assess 
Mr Bs ability to make  his loan repayments in a sustainable  way from loan 10. As a responsible 
lender, Lending Stream  would not have agreed to any further credit  for
Mr B, given that this would increase his indebtedness and potentially impact negatively  on his 
creditworthiness. 
Therefore, I think Lending Stream was irresponsible to have agreed loan 10 and all further loans  
following Loan  10.
I am planning  to uphold Mr Bs complaint in relation to Loans 10 to 28 because I think  that the overall 
pattern of lending increased Mr Bs indebtedness in an unsustainable fashion. And the number  of 
these loans appearing on Mr Bs credit file will itself likely have had an adverse effect on his ability to 
obtain and access mainstream credit. So I think it is fair and reasonable for Lending Stream  to 
remove all reference  to Loans  10 to 28, if it has not already done so.  
August 2018  effect  on the redress  calculations
I remain unclear exactly as to why various  accounts and credit file entries changed in late 
August 2018  for Mr B. But one thing which has not altered is that Mr B has not received  any refund 
and interest  money.  When  carrying  out the calculations  I think it will be fair and reasonable  for the 
interest of 8% (simple) to be calculated  on each  loan from the date he paid money over to Lending 
Stream to the date of final settlement. And by that I do not mean 28 August 2018, but the date of final 
resolution of this complaint.  
And I say this because I think  it was the case that Lending Stream did agree to our adjudicators first 
opinion in August 2018 and then demonstrated by its actions that it meant to carry  those  
recommendations out. Its change of position and insistence on a final determination,  which this 
provisional decision  demonstrates is broadly in line with our adjudicators opinion,  has led to a delay. 
And it would not be right that Lending Stream  were to argue that the accounts  closed on 
28 August 2018 and so the 8% only needs be calculated to that date. 
If Lending Stream has closed and written off any outstanding balances in relation  to 
Loans 26, 27 and 28 because of its actions in August 2018  then I do not think it will be fair or 
reasonable for Lending  Stream to resurrect those loans and I consider that any principal balance 
write-offs (if they were carried out) ought to remain.
Ref: DRN057119310 
Lending Stream has its two week window of opportunity (on top of the week I have given to it recently) 
to come back to me to explain more about  this. 
putting things  right
I think  it would be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of Mr Bs complaint  for Lending Stream  
to put things  right in the following way: 
refund all the interest, fees and charges  for Loan 4 and Loans 9 to 28; and
add interest at 8% per year* simple on the above interest  and charges from the date they 
were paid by Mr B to the date of final resolution of this complaint; 
remove from Mr Bs credit file adverse payment information for Loans 4 and 9; 
remove from Mr Bs credit file all reference to loans 10 to 28.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest.  Lending  Stream 
must give Mr B a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
