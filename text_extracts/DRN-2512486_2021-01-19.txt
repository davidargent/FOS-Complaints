The complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA closed both of his accounts without 
notice and without adequate explanation.
What happened
Mr S had two accounts with PayPal. In early 2020, PayPal wrote to him to tell him that both 
accounts were suspended and would be closed without notice. The explanation for this was 
vague, and Mr S says PayPal had failed to tell him what he had done wrong or given him a 
chance to defend himself. He asked for the accounts to be reinstated, since he had recently 
sold an item online for Â£99 but the buyer was now unable to pay him through PayPal (and 
was refusing to pay him by other means due to security concerns). When PayPal did not 
change its mind or accept that it had done anything wrong, Mr S brought this complaint to 
our Service.
Our investigator did not uphold this complaint. Since his decision was based on evidence 
PayPal shared with us in confidence, his reasons were unavoidably sparse, but he said that 
PayPal had been entitled to decide to close the accounts, because it had concluded that 
Mr S had not complied with PayPals terms and conditions. Those terms allowed PayPal to 
suspend or close an account immediately. He said PayPal had followed its procedures 
correctly.
Mr S did not think that was fair. He said that neither PayPal nor the investigator had proved 
(let alone explained) what he had done wrong, and that this was a breach of natural justice. 
He said the information which PayPal and our Service had relied on should be disclosed to 
him so that he could make submissions about it. He asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would like to apologise to both parties for how long it has taken for this complaint to be 
resolved. This was due to a long backlog of cases at our Service, but I recognise that this 
will be of little consolation to Mr S, and for that I am sorry.
Having considered this case, I have decided not to uphold it. I will explain why.
I have some sympathy for Mr Ss complaint about being denied natural justice and 
procedural fairness in this case, since he has never been told what it was he did which led to 
PayPals decision to close his accounts. Understandably, that makes it hard for him to 
contest PayPals decision, or our investigators decision, since he does not know what case 
he has to answer. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to share with him the information he 
wants to know. That is because PayPal shared its evidence with us in confidence, which 
PayPal is entitled to do under our rules. The rules allow me to summarise confidential 
evidence, and I have considered whether I should do that here, but I think that in this 
instance it would not be possible to do so consistently with respecting the reason why the 
evidence has to remain confidential (which is to avoid disclosing information which might be 
helpful in evading or circumventing PayPals policies). I realise that Mr S will not regard this 
as a satisfactory answer, but I do not think that can be helped.
Having considered the evidence myself, I think that PayPal reached its decision reasonably 
and in good faith, and that it has acted in accordance with the terms and conditions which 
permit it to close an account without delay. (I will not quote the relevant terms here as they 
have been shown to Mr S before.) It follows that I must conclude that PayPal has done 
nothing wrong, and so I cannot interfere with its decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 February 2021. If he rejects it, then he will not be bound by it, 
and he will remain free to pursue any other remedy he may have.
