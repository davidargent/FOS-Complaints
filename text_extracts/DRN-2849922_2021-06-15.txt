The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that NewDay Ltd didnt refund a payment hed made.
What happened
In April 2020, Mr S ordered a number of bottles of alcohol from an overseas online retailer Ill 
call G. The order totalled £1,123.70. He paid this using his NewDay credit card branded as 
Aqua. A courier service then delivered this order the following month. Mr S told us he signed 
to confirm receipt of the goods. But when he opened the boxes, he says almost half the 
order was missing. He told us he thought maybe the order was arriving in two deliveries due 
to its size.
 
Later the same day, Mr S emailed G asking when he would receive the rest of his order. 
When he didnt get a reply, he emailed again a few days later. G replied straight away saying 
all four parcels were delivered by the courier a few days earlier. Mr S told G that while hed 
received a delivery, this hadnt contained his whole order.
 
Again, G replied straight away asking him to send pictures of the parcels with the goods 
inside as it needed this to look into what could have happened and to open an investigation 
with the courier. But Mr S said that while he could send pictures of the goods, the packaging 
had already been thrown away.
 
As Mr S couldnt resolve the issue with G, he got in touch with NewDay. It credited the 
amount of the disputed items - £564.36  back to his credit card account while it tried a 
chargeback with the card scheme operator. This was in June 2020. NewDay told Mr S this 
amount could be debited back to his account if G challenged the chargeback.
 
G did indeed challenge this, telling NewDay the order and been completed and Mr S had 
signed for it. The disputed amount was re-debited to his account on September 2020. Mr S 
wasnt happy with this, so NewDay looked at a claim under Section 75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974 (S75). When he didnt hear anything, Mr S complained. While NewDay was 
looking into the complaint, it told him it had rejected his S75 claim.
 
Shortly after, NewDay issued its final response to Mr Ss complaint. In short, it said: NewDay 
had correctly followed the chargeback process; and, the S75 claim had been unsuccessful. 
But, as a gesture of goodwill, NewDay did refund fees totalling £36 which had been charged 
when the re-applied transaction took Mr S over his credit card limit.
 
Mr S wasnt happy with this response, so he brought his complaint to our service. One of our 
investigators looked into this issue. In summary, she didnt think NewDay had done anything 
wrong as the evidence didnt show thered been a breach of contract by G.
 
Mr S didnt accept our investigators view. He told us that while the right number of boxes 
arrived, there were a lot less bottles inside than there should have been. Mr S was also 
unhappy with the thoroughness of NewDays investigation. He said NewDay had his 
complaint for months and when he chased a response, he was told it hadnt been looked into 
yet  but about an hour later he was told his S75 claim had been rejected.
 
As the matter remains unresolved, its been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive decided not to uphold it. Ill explain why. But first Im very aware that Ive 
summarised this complaint briefly, in less detail than has been provided, and in my own 
words. No discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on what I think is the heart 
of the matter here: did NewDay treat Mr S fairly and reasonably when it didnt refund the 
disputed amount of £564.36 to him?
 
If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive ignored it. I havent. Im satisfied 
I dont need to comment on every individual point or argument to be able to reach what I 
think is a fair outcome. Our rules allow me to do this. This simply reflects the informal nature 
of our service as a free alternative to the courts.
 
A chargeback is a way in which payment settlement disputes are resolved between card 
issuers, such as NewDay, and merchants. These disputes are dealt with under the relevant 
card scheme rules. In certain circumstances, the process provides a way for NewDay to ask 
G to refund part of the payment Mr S had made. These circumstances would include where 
all of an order wasnt delivered, which is what Mr S told us happened here.
A chargeback doesnt guarantee a refund. A merchant can defend any chargeback claim. 
When that happens, NewDay can pursue it further through the chargeback scheme. Theres 
no obligation on NewDay to submit a chargeback or pursue it further if its then defended. 
But I would consider it good practice for a chargeback to be attempted where the right exists 
and there is a reasonable prospect of success.
 
Ive looked at NewDays records. I can see that based on Mr Ss testimony, NewDay 
submitted a chargeback to G for the goods he said he hadnt received. NewDay credited 
Mr Ss account with the disputed amount of £564.36 in early June 2020. At the same time it 
told him in writing this amount could be debited back to his account if G provided more 
details. Thats exactly what happened. G defended NewDays chargeback attempt.
 
Within the timescale set out in the card scheme providers rules, G sent evidence that the 
delivery had been made in full and told NewDay Mr S had signed for his order. Ive looked at 
this evidence. It shows a stamped delivery note with details of the full order. While its not 
dated, it shows a delivery time of 11:07. I would note at this point that Mr S doesnt dispute 
he signed for the delivery.
 
With this evidence from G that the order had been delivered in full and signed for, I can fully 
understand why NewDay didnt pursue the chargeback further. It had the option to ask the 
card scheme provider to arbitrate on this. I would have expected NewDay to do this if there 
was a reasonable prospect of success. But Mr S wasnt able to back up his testimony that 
delivery was incomplete, such as photos of the delivery packaging to show what was 
missing.
 
After weighing up the evidence from G against Mr Ss verbal testimony, I can fully 
understand why NewDay decided not to pursue the chargeback further. So it debited 
£564.36 back to Mr Ss account. This was around September 2020. As hed made further 
purchases, this took him over his credit limit. Taking all this into account, Im satisfied NewDay followed the chargeback process as I would expect and treated Mr S in a fair and 
reasonable way.
 
To try and assist Mr S further, NewDay then looked at a S75 claim for him. Its records show 
this happened mid-September 2020. S75 sets out that in certain circumstances, as the 
provider of the finance used to purchase the goods, Mr S has a like claim against NewDay 
for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by G. Im satisfied those circumstances apply 
here. 
I know NewDay has said S75 doesnt apply because the goods were delivered by a courier. 
Its position is that this breaks the debtor, creditor, supplier (DCS) link between G, Mr S and 
NewDay thats needed under S75. I dont agree. I think the courier was acting on behalf of G 
here and this doesnt break the DCS link. So, as above, Im satisfied the circumstances 
required for a S75 claim were present.
 
For there to be a successful claim under S75, Mr S needs to demonstrate that G made a 
misrepresentation about what he was buying or that theres been a breach of contract. Its 
not been suggested at any point that G misrepresented the goods to Mr S. He was expecting 
alcohol and he received the type of alcohol hed ordered. Its the quantity hes disputing. 
Instead, Mr S is claiming under S75 that theres been a breach of contract as not all of his 
order has been delivered.
 
But, similar to Mr Ss chargeback claim, other than his testimony, hes not been able to 
provide anything to back up that the delivery was incomplete. Hes also confirmed to both us 
and NewDay that he signed to say he received the delivery. When Mr S raised the issue with 
G, it quite reasonably asked him for pictures of the parcels that had been delivered showing 
what goods were inside. G also told Mr S it needed a photo of the parcels so it could open 
an investigation with the courier. But Mr S couldnt provide any of these as hed already 
thrown away all the packaging.
 
Again, after NewDay weighed up Mr Ss testimony against the information provided by G, I 
can understand why it didnt think a breach of contract had been demonstrated, and why it 
then rejected the S75 claim. Once more, Im satisfied this was a fair and reasonable course 
of action for NewDay to take. 
I know Mr S feels that NewDay didnt investigate this matter properly. He says he was told 
his complaint hadnt been looked at yet, but then he got a call around an hour later rejecting 
his S75 claim. I would point out here that while Mr S, quite understandably, is treating his 
complaint to NewDay and his S75 claim as one issue, they are quite distinct. NewDay raised 
the S75 claim for him in mid-September 2020. Then, some weeks later, when he hadnt 
heard anything, he complained.
 
NewDay then raised a complaint for him. I can see it wrote to him on 27 November 2020 and 
on 24 December 2020 saying it was still looking into his complaint and apologising for the 
delay. NewDay then sent Mr S its final response to his complaint on 28 December 2020.
 
But while NewDay was dealing with the complaint, it was also dealing separately with his 
S75 claim. So when Mr S was told his complaint hadnt been dealt with yet, but then was told 
later that same day his claim had been rejected, this didnt mean NewDay only started 
looking at his S75 claim that day. As above, I can see it started looking at his S75 claim 
around three months earlier. In any event, Im satisfied NewDay dealt with the S75 claim as I 
would expect it to. 
In summary, in the circumstances outlined above, I think NewDay dealt with Mr Ss 
chargeback and S75 claim in a fair and reasonable way. Im also satisfied it didnt treat him unfairly or unreasonably by not giving him a refund. For these reasons, Im not upholding this 
complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2021.
