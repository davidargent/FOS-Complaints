The complaint
Mr E complains, via a third party, that Frasers Group Financial Services Limited trading as 
Studio Retail Limited (Studio) lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
In 2002 Mr E applied for an account with Studio which was opened with an unknown credit 
limit. 
In January 2016 Mr Es credit limit stood at £1,950. In January 2017 this was decreased to 
£980 before being increased in February 2017 to £1,230, in May 2017 to £1,430, in 
June 2017 to £1,630 and in August 2017 to £1,830. In October 2020 Mr E closed his 
account with nothing further owing to Studio since January 2019.
Mr E says that Studio had lent to him irresponsibly.
Studio looked into Mr Es complaint but rejected it. 
As he was unhappy with Studios response, Mr E referred his complaint to us. One of our 
investigators looked into it. She came to the view that Studio did nothing wrong in providing 
Mr E with a credit limit that stood at £1,950 in January 2016, but the credit limit increases to 
£1,230 (from £980) in February 2017, to £1,430 in May 2017, to £1,630 in June 2017 and to 
£1,830 in August 2017 shouldnt have been provided. 
Mr E didnt say whether he accepted the investigators view or not, but Studio said it didnt. 
And because of the latter Mr Es complaint was passed to me for review and decision. 
On 30 November 2023 I issued a provisional decision on this case. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint, but Ive reached a different conclusion 
from that of our investigator. 
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on 
our website. Ive used this approach to help me decide Mr Es complaint.
Studio had a duty to conduct proportionate checks to ensure the level of borrowing it offered 
Mr E was affordable for him to repay in a sustainable way. It needed to do this when it first 
offered Mr E the account, and each time it agreed an increase in the credit limit.
Studio has provided evidence regarding the credit checks it completed on each occasion, 
and what information it found. Studio also considered the data it held internally, such as how 
Mr E was managing the account.
Mr E hasnt said whether he accepted the investigators view that Studio did nothing wrong 
in providing him with a credit limit that stood at £1,950 in January 2016. But for the 
avoidance of doubt and for the sake of completeness I can confirm that, like the investigator, 
Ive seen nothing that would lead me to conclude Studio did anything wrong in granting this 
credit limit. And because of my view in this respect it follows that Im satisfied that Studio did 
nothing wrong in opening the account for Mr E in 2002.
The investigator came to the view that Studio shouldnt have granted Mr E the credit limit 
increase that it did in February 2017 (or any of the subsequent increases) on the grounds of 
his account conduct immediately prior to February 2017.
Im satisfied that based on Mr Es account conduct prior to February 2017 Studio should 
have conducted further (and proportionate) checks before agreeing to any of the credit limit 
increases that it did.
To be clear, I dont think Studio necessarily should have obtained bank statements from 
Mr E, but in the absence of it having conducted further checks at the relevant times  such 
as asking him more about his income and expenditure  Ive considered bank statements 
provided to our service by Mr E covering the period November 2016 to August 2017.
Having considered these statements I can confirm that Im satisfied that further (and 
proportionate) checks by Studio wouldnt have caused it to conclude that the four limit 
increases granted wouldnt have been sustainably affordable for Mr E. In coming to this 
conclusion Ive had regard to Mr Es account credits (including income and benefits), 
non-discretionary expenditure, his overdraft usage and account (or lack of account) charges.
I also think its worth pointing out that despite these four credit limit increases:
Mr Es account debt never exceeded £750, less than the credit limit of £980 in place in 
January 2017
between February 2017 and August 2017 Mr E reduced his account debt from approximately 
£750 to approximately £450
between September 2017 and January 2019 Mr E reduced his account debt from 
approximately £450 to £nil
credit limit increases totalling £850 (between January 2017 and August 2018) would only 
have necessitated an increase in what could be deemed a sustainable monthly repayment 
(from Mr E) of £40  
I appreciate Mr E will be disappointed. But given what I say above I can confirm that Im 
satisfied that Studio didnt act unfairly or unreasonably in opening the account or in granting 
any of the credit limit increases that it did.
Studio responded to my provisional decision to acknowledge receipt but with no new 
evidence to add. Mr E didnt respond to my provisional decision by the date I gave.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As I havent any new evidence to consider from either Studio or Mr E, I see no reason to 
depart from my provisional findings and I now confirm them as final.My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 January 2024.
