K820x#14complaint
Mr F complains that BMW  Financial Services(GB) Limited (BMWFS) has treated him 
unfairly in respect  of his hire purchase (HP) agreement with it.
background
Mr F entered  into an HP agreement with BMWFS in August 2016 for a used car. The cash 
price of the car was £16,165.
Mr F made an advance payment of £1,717.30 and financed the balance of £14,447.70. 
Under the terms of the HP agreement,  everything  else being equal,  Mr F undertook to make 
48 monthly payments  of £240.65 followed by one further payment  of £7,607.86  making a 
total repayable  of £20,876.36.
In early 2018 Mr F started  to experience financial difficulties with his HP agreement falling 
into arrears.
In June 2018 BMWFS  says it issued Mr F with a default notice.
In July 2018 BMWFS terminated Mr Fs HP agreement and took steps  to recover/repossess 
the car. It says it issued  Mr F with a notice  in this respect.
Between July 2018 and July 2019  Mr F made  a number of payments towards his HP 
agreement liability.
In July 2019 BMWFS obtained  a county  court judgement for the return of the car. However, 
this judgement was suspended on an undertaking from Mr F to pay £11,185.36 (inclusive of 
£563 court  costs) broken down as follows:
£3,360 at £240 a month  for 14 months  commencing July 2019
£7,825.36  in September 2020
As I understand it Mr F met his obligations under the above order and now owns the car.
A final view was issued  in respect of this complaint by one of our investigators in 
November 2020.  He came to the view that BMWFS had done  nothing wrong in its treatment 
of Mr F up to July 2019, the date when BMWFSs request  for the return of the car was 
considered by the court.
Mr F didnt  agree with the investigators view, so his complaint has been  passed to me for 
review and decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill start by emphasising  that were  not the regulator of financial businesses,  and we dont 
police their internal processes, or how they operate generally. Thats the job of the 
Financial Conduct  Authority. 
Ref: DRN06751032We deal with individual disputes between businesses and their customers. In doing that, we 
dont replicate the work of the courts. Were impartial, and we dont  take either sides  
instructions on how we investigate a complaint. We conduct our investigations and reach  our 
conclusions without interference from anyone else.
Its clear Mr F has very strong feelings  about  this complaint. He has provided detailed  
submissions in support  of his view which I can confirm  Ive read and considered  in their 
entirety. However, I trust that Mr F will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I 
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as 
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every  point  raised. The purpose 
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them. I would also point 
out that where the information Ive got is incomplete,  unclear or contradictory, Ive to base 
my decision  on the balance of probabilities. 
For the avoidance of doubt, I would like to make it clear that Im only considering in this 
decision the treatment  of Mr F by BMWFS between March 2018 and July 2019, July 2019  
being the date when  BMWFSs request for the return of the car was considered  by the court.
March 2018 to July 2018
Having considered everything  both parties  have  said and submitted about what happened  
between March 2018 and July 2018,  Im satisfied that:
The following arrears position accrued  on Mr Fs account  prior to it being terminated  
by BMWFS on 18 July 2018:
21 March 2018 £240.65  1 month
21 April 2018 £481.30  2 months
21 May 2008 £721.95  3 months
21 June 2018 £762.60  3 months+
BMWFS sent all letters required by it in respect  of Mr Fs account.  Now I appreciate  
that Mr F says he didnt receive  BMWFS  21 June 2018  Default Notice,  or its 
16 July 2018 agreement termination/recovery  notice, but I only need  to be satisfied 
these two notices  were sent, not that they were  received. And having seen copies of 
these two notices  (correctly addressed) and having had regard to BMWFS system 
notes, Im persuaded  that on the balance of probabilities both were indeed  sent.
At no time did BMWFS agree a payment plan with Mr F. I would also add that even if 
I was to accept that there was some  misunderstanding or confusion  on this point  
(which for the avoidance of doubt  I dont),  I might  have  expected  Mr F to ask for such  
a plan to be confirmed in writing and for such confirmation to be sent, which it never  
was.
On more than one occasion before BMWFS took the decision to terminate the 
agreement Mr F advised it he would be clearing the arrears  shortly, yet he didnt do 
so.
Ref: DRN06751033July 2018 to July 2019
Having considered everything  both parties  have  said and submitted about what happened  
between July 2018 and July 2019,  Im satisfied that:
BMWFS did nothing wrong  in trying to seek the return of the car from Mr F. After all, 
the agreement  by this time had been terminated  and was no longer in place, or in 
force.
Mr F was able to reduce the arrears,  but again this was this was after the agreement 
had been terminated  and was no longer  in place, or in force.
Having been  unable to obtain recovery of the car, and with the agreement having  
been terminated and no longer being  in place, or in force, BMWFS  didnt act unfairly  
or unreasonably  in seeking recovery of the car via the courts.
Now I dont underestimate Mr Fs strength  of feeling but given what  I say above  Im satisfied  
that in the particular circumstances  of this case BMWFS  didnt act unfairly  or unreasonably 
in its treatment of Mr F between March 2018 and July 2019,  July 2019 being  the date when 
BMWFSs request for the return of the car was considered  by the court.
my final decision
My final decision is I dont  uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 March  2021.
