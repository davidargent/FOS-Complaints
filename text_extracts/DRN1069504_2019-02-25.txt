K820x#14complaint
Miss T and her representative complain about  a letter NewDay  Ltd sent her which they say 
was misleading.
background
Miss T wanted to start a section 75 Consumer Credit Act claim with NewDay  to obtain a 
refund for some damaged  items  bought from a retailer. But NewDay  referred her to the 
retailer rather than also giving her information about how to go about a section 75 claim. Her 
representative says New Days letter to her of 3 July 2018 was misleading.  
Miss T has subsequently  pursued a section 75 claim with NewDay  but this complaint is only 
about the letter it sent out, not that claim.
Our investigator felt this complaint  should  be upheld. He said he understands why Miss T 
believes the letter NewDay sent on 3 July 2018 was misleading and couldve provided more 
information on her options.  It referred her to the retailer but it shouldve also provided 
information on how to make a section 75 claim. And it wouldve been fair for it to explain her 
options with NewDay  as well. Despite this Miss T wasnt inconvenienced too much as she 
made her section 75 claim to NewDay within a week of receiving the letter.  He isnt asking 
NewDay to pay her any compensation. 
Miss Ts representative remains unhappy  and has asked for an ombudsman review. He says 
NewDays letter was deliberately misleading  and it didnt want her to raise  a section 75 
claim.    
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It was reasonable  for NewDay to suggest  in its letter of 3 July 2018 that Miss T should  
contact the retailer  about the quality of the items  shed bought. But I agree that it wouldve 
been helpful and appropriate for it to have also mentioned the rights  she might  have against 
NewDay and how to go about making a section 75 claim.
Even so this failing clearly  didnt cause Miss T any real or significant inconvenience  as she 
made the section  75 claim to NewDay on 10 July 2018, within a week  of receiving its letter to 
her.
All consumers spend some time and experience some additional  inconvenience  in dealing  
with a complaint  and putting things right. We wouldnt generally  recommend theyre  
compensated for this and Im not persuaded that I can reasonably depart from this approach 
in this case. 
Furthermore I note Miss T has started  County Court  proceedings  against both the retailer 
and NewDay and part of her claim is for damages for the stress and anxiety trying to resolve 
matters. So, I think the question of any award of compensation is a matter properly left to the 
County Court to consider.
Ref: DRN10695042Overall I think  the investigators proposed resolution  of this complaint is fair and I dont  think  I 
can reasonably  require NewDay to do anything. 
I dont see any reason to change  the proposed outcome in this case.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 March  2019.
