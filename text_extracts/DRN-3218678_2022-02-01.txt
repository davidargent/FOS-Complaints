The complaint
Mr D complains about the way that some replacement windows and doors, that he paid for 
using a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank Limited, were sold to him. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mr D used a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank that he electronically signed in 
November 2018 to pay for some replacement windows and doors. The loan was for £9,845 
which he agreed to repay by 120 monthly instalments of £179.30. He and his wife also 
signed the suppliers purchase order.
Mr Ds representative complained to Shawbrook Bank in August 2020 about the way that the 
replacement windows and doors and the loan agreement were sold to Mr D. Shawbrook 
Bank set out in detail its reasons for rejecting his complaint but Mr D wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She considered 
Shawbrook Banks response to Mr Ds claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. She didnt think that shed seen enough evidence to suggest that there was a 
qualifying misrepresentation under section 75 so she didnt agree that Shawbrook Bank had 
acted unfairly. Nor did she agree that Shawbrook Bank should rescind the agreement or 
refund the payments that Mr D had already made.
Mr Ds representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. His representative says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
the supplier wasnt unauthorised to be a credit broker and the loan agreement shows 
the credit intermediary as being a company that was related to the supplier but had 
stopped trading;
the related company was taken to court in June 2016, and convicted in June 2017, of 
using high-pressure sales tactics but continued to use banned sales practices and 
Shawbrook Bank would have been aware of that;
Mr D was given incorrect information by the supplier and if hed been given the 
correct information he wouldnt have agreed to buy the replacement windows and 
doors and he hasnt been allowed a proper choice; and
the documentation used by Shawbrook Bank breaches section 61(1) of the 
Consumer Credit Act because its not accurate or in line with the sales contract 
signed by Mr D.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr D used credit provider by Shawbrook Bank to pay for the replacement windows 
and doors and, in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right 
to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ds complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the 
replacement windows and doors and that Shawbrook Banks response to his claim 
under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of 
Mr Ds claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr D and his wife signed the suppliers purchase order form which showed a contract 
price of £11,314 for some replacement windows and doors and an account subsidy 
of £1,469 which reduced the account option to price to £9,845  and the account 
option had been selected on the form;
Mr D also signed a feature home agreement and subsidy analysis in which he agreed 
to participate in a feature home promotion and it set out a two year fixed cost of the 
replacement windows and doors of £14,691 and the total marketing subsidy of 
£4,846 which reduced the price to £9,845  which was the amount shown on the 
purchase order and the loan agreement;
Mr D electronically signed the fixed sum loan agreement in November 2018 and it set 
out that the total price of the replacement windows and doors, and the amount of 
credit, as £9,845 - and the other required information including the interest rate, the 
total amount payable and the number and the amount of the monthly repayments;
the loan agreement said that the credit intermediary was a company that had 
stopped trading and which was related to the supplier  that was clearly incorrect but 
the supplier was correctly identified on the order form and was using a trading style 
that used part of the name of the related company;
Mr Ds representative has provided a report about some legal proceedings against 
the related company in which it was convicted of using high-pressure sales tactics  
but it hasnt provided a copy of the court judgment so Ive not been able to fully 
consider those proceedings  but those legal proceedings are about the related 
company and not the supplier and they arent enough to show that the supplier used 
those high-pressure sales tactics when selling the windows to Mr D;  
I consider that Mr D would have known, or ought reasonably to have known, that the 
supplier was the company identified on the order form and that loan was being 
provided to him by Shawbrook Bank  even though the credit intermediary was 
incorrectly shown on the loan agreement and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that he was induced into making the order, or entering into the loan 
agreement, by a misrepresentation about the identity of the supplier;
Mr Ds representative says that the loan agreement isnt accurate so doesnt comply 
with section 61(1) of the Consumer Credit Act  but Mr D had agreed to pay £9,845 
for the replacement windows and doors which was the amount of credit provided to 
him under the loan agreement, and Im not persuaded that the error about the credit 
intermediary would be enough to cause the loan agreement not to comply with 
section 61(1) or not to have been properly executed (but that would be for a court to 
decide); 
the windows and doors were installed so Mr D received the replacement windows 
and doors that hed agreed to pay for, but hes complained about the sales tactics that were used by the supplier - he agreed to pay £9,845 for the replacement 
windows and doors that were described on the purchase order, which included the 
subsidies that were shown on the order form and the feature home agreement, and 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the supplier 
misrepresented the windows and doors or the loan agreement to Mr D at that time or 
that it used sales tactics for which Shawbrook Bank would have any liability under 
section 75;
the order form said that the supplier would accept a cancellation of the contract if it 
received notice in writing within 7 days and the loan agreement said that Mr D could 
withdraw from the loan agreement within 14 days  but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mr D tried to cancel the order or withdraw from the loan within those 
periods  and his complaint wasnt made to Shawbrook Bank until August 2020 
(about 18 months after the windows and doors had been installed) and if he wasnt 
happy with the way that the windows had been sold to him I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him to have complained soon after he signed the order form;
Mr Ds representative has described some issues that Mr D has with the windows 
and doors  but those issues werent described in the complaint that was initially 
made to Shawbrook Bank and Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that 
Mr D has complained to the supplier or Shawbrook Bank about those issues  I cant 
consider a complaint about those issues as part of this complaint but Mr D can make 
a claim to Shawbrook Bank under section 75 about any breach of contract by the 
supplier and, if hes not satisfied with its response, he may be able to make a 
separate complaint to this service;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances  Mr Ds representative has made many detailed 
points in support of Mr Ds complaint  Ive considered all of those points but, if I 
havent specifically referred to one of those points its because Ive referred to the 
ones that I consider to be necessary for me to refer to make a decision on his 
complaint;
I sympathise with Mr D for the way that he clearly feels about his dealings with the 
supplier, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier; and
I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to his section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for 
me to require it to end the loan agreement, to refund to Mr D any of his monthly 
payments, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2022.
