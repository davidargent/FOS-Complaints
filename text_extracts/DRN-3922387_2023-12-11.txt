The complaint
Mr and Mrs B complain that Vacation Finance Limited, trading as VFL Finance Solutions, 
wont refund to them the money that they paid for some holiday club vacation weeks. Theyre 
being represented in their complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs B had bought a holiday product from a holiday company in May 2016. The price 
was £18,000 which they paid using a loan from a finance provider. They say that they paid 
off the loan in October 2017. They entered into a membership application agreement in 
October 2017 to acquire a vacation week from the holiday company. The membership 
application price was £35,000 and they say that they traded in the holiday product that theyd 
bought in May 2016 and that they made a bank transfer of £10,500 (which was deferred by 
three months). They also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Vacation Finance 
which shows that the cash price was £35,000 and that an advance payment of £10,500 was 
made so the loan amount was £24,500. Mr and Mrs B agreed to make 120 monthly 
payments of £318.37 to Vacation Finance but the loan was repaid in February 2018.
Mr and Mrs B entered into another membership application agreement in October 2018 to 
acquire another vacation week from the holiday company. The membership application price 
was £42,000 and they entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Vacation Finance for a 
loan of £7,000 and they say that they entered into a separate loan agreement with another 
finance provider for a loan of £35,000. They agreed to make 120 monthly payments of 
£90.96 to Vacation Finance.
Mr and Mrs B complained to Vacation Finance in February 2021 regarding the miss-selling 
of the October 2018 loan and they included a document detailing their dealings with the 
holiday company and how they were sold the holiday products. They proposed that they 
hand back the membership certificate for the vacation week that theyd acquired in October 
2018 and write-off the money that theyd already paid for the loan and that Vacation Finance 
should terminate the loan agreement. Vacation Finance said that it was, in principle, happy 
to meet with those proposals but there was additional finance with another finance provider 
and it suggested that they discuss their options with the new operating company of the 
holiday club. Mr and Mrs B say that they made the same complaint and proposal to the other 
finance provider but they didnt pursue it any further as they were in discussions with an 
adviser about exiting their memberships and were instructed not to have any further 
communications with their finance providers.
Mr and Mrs Bs representative, on behalf of Mr and Mrs B, made separate claims to Vacation 
Finance in January 2022 about the October 2017 and October 2018 loans. It said that the 
claims were made under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and that 
the vacation weeks were mis-sold to Mr and Mrs B and, but for the misrepresentations made 
to them, they wouldnt have purchased them nor entered into the loan agreements. It also 
said that the holiday company was in liquidation and couldnt provide the services sold so 
was in breach of contract. The letters also included claims that: the terms of the agreements 
are so egregious as to be unfair; the payment of commission was hidden from view; the 
memberships were marketed as investments in contravention of the Timeshare, Holiday 
Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 and were sold to Mr and Mrs B 
under extreme sales pressure; proper affordability checks werent undertaken and Mr and 
Mrs Bs relationship with Vacation Finance is unfair. 
Vacation Finance issued detailed response letters to those claims in February 2022 and said 
that it hadnt seen or been presented with any evidence which would lead it to conclude that 
Mr and Mrs B's products were mis-sold or misrepresented to them at the times of the 
purchases. It also said Mr and Mrs B fully paid off the October 2017 loan in February 2018 
and were fully up to date with their instalment payments for the October 2018 loan so its 
clear that affordability wasnt an issue for them and it didnt uphold any of their complaints. 
Mr and Mrs B werent satisfied with its response so they made two complaints to this service 
 one about the October 2017 loan and the other about the October 2018 loan. They also 
provided a statement in which they set out their response to Vacation Finances final 
response letters. Their complaint forms says that: Vacation Finance paid commissions to the 
holiday company which werent declared to them; the holiday company failed to conduct 
proper assessments of their ability to afford the loans; the vacation weeks were 
misrepresented to them; the holiday company unduly pressured them into entering into the 
purchase agreements and the loan agreements and used aggressive commercial practices 
to pressure them; the holiday company is in liquidation so is in breach of contract; and they 
werent provided with key information necessary for them to be able to make informed 
decisions regarding their purchases; all rendering the loan agreements unfair under section 
140A; and they say that their claims should also be considered under section 75.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Bs complaint should be upheld. She 
said that the purchases were for single items with cash prices of £35,000 and £42,000 which 
werent within the limits for a claim under section 75 so section 75 didnt apply to the 
purchases. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between 
Mr and Mrs B and Vacation Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would 
reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She said that shed seen that no 
commission was paid to the holiday company by Vacation Finance in relation to the 
purchases. She didnt think that the checks carried out by Vacation Finance before it agreed 
to lend to Mr and Mrs B in October 2017 and October 2018 were reasonable and 
proportionate but she wasnt persuaded that more detailed checks would have given it a 
reason to think that the lending was likely to have been unsustainable and unaffordable for 
them.
Mr and Mrs Bs representative says that Mr and Mrs B arent accepting our investigators 
recommendation and would like the matter referred to an ombudsman for a decision. They 
described their February 2021 proposal to Vacation Finance and explained why they didnt 
pursue it any further. Mr and Mrs Bs representative has provided a document containing 
detailed submissions from it and Mr and Mrs B in response to our investigators 
recommendations which says: the memberships were sold to Mr and Mrs B as investments 
that were extremely desirable and could easily be resold at a profit; Mr and Mrs B were 
responsible for paying maintenance charges and failure to pay them would result in 
termination of the membership with no refund; theres no viable secondary market for 
timeshares; the holiday company had a responsibility to give Mr and Mrs B sufficient 
information for them to make an informed contractual decision, including the value on the 
open market of the products being purchased along with their likely value on the open 
market in the future; and our investigator has failed to properly assess Mr and Mrs Bs claims 
under sections 75 and 140A and, had she done so, they would have been upheld. It also 
described the reasons that they consider that the lending to Mr and Mrs B was irresponsible.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Bs complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
Mr and Mrs B had bought a holiday product from the holiday company in May 2016 
but that was paid for using a loan from a finance provider that wasnt Vacation 
Finance and they say that they paid off the loan in October 2017 so that loan doesnt 
form part of their complaint;
Mr and Mrs B say that they traded in that holiday product for a vacation week from 
the holiday company in October 2017 and the membership application agreement 
that they signed shows that they acquired a vacation week each year at a specified 
club and membership level during medium season, with a sea view and a maximum 
occupancy of four  it also shows that the membership application fee was £35,000;
they say that as well as trading in the holiday product, they made a bank transfer of 
£10,500 (which they say was deferred for three months) and they entered into a loan 
agreement with Vacation Finance which shows that the cash price was £35,000, an 
advance payment of £10,500 was made and the loan amount was £24,500;
Mr and Mrs B entered into another membership application agreement in October 
2018 to acquire another vacation week from the holiday company and the 
membership application agreement that they signed shows that they acquired a 
vacation week each year at a specified club and membership level during high 
season with a maximum occupancy of two and that the membership application fee 
was £42,000;
they entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Vacation Finance for a loan of 
£7,000 and they say that they entered into a separate loan agreement with another 
finance provider for a loan of £35,000  the loan agreement shows that the cash 
price was £42,000, that they made an advance payment of £35,000 and that the 
amount of the loan from Vacation Finance was £7,000;
Mr and Mrs Bs representative, on behalf of Mr and Mrs B, made claims to Vacation 
Finance in January 2022 under sections 75 and 140A about both loans - section 75 
gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or 
the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section are met) and section 
140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay 
any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an 
unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
one of the criteria for a claim under section 75 is that section 75 doesnt apply to a 
claim that relates to any single item to which the supplier has attached a cash price 
not exceeding £100 or more than £30,000;
the cash price for the vacation week that Mr and Mrs B acquired in October 2017 was 
£35,000 and the cash price for the vacation week that they acquired in October 2018 
was £42,000  both of those amounts are more than the £30,000 maximum limit for a 
claim under section 75 so I dont consider that Mr and Mrs Bs claims relate to a 
single item to which the holiday company has attached a cash price exceeding £100 
but not more than £30,000 so I find that theyre unable to make a claim under section 
75 about those acquisitions;although I cant make a finding in these circumstances on a breach of contract claim 
under section 75, I understand that the holiday company went into liquidation in May 
2020, but I also understand that a new management company has been appointed to 
provide the services in connection with the vacation weeks that Mr and Mrs B had 
acquired and that they are available for them to use;
Mr and Mrs Bs complaint forms say that Vacation Finance paid commissions to the 
holiday company which werent declared to them; the holiday company failed to 
conduct proper assessments of their ability to afford the loans; the vacation weeks 
were misrepresented to them; the holiday company unduly pressured them into 
entering into the purchase agreements and the loan agreements and used 
aggressive commercial practices to pressure them; the holiday company is in 
liquidation so is in breach of contract; and they werent provided with key information 
necessary for them to be able to make informed decisions regarding their purchases; 
all rendering the loan agreements unfair under section 140A;
although I find that Mr and Ms B are unable to make claims under section 75, they 
are able to make claims under section 140A so in this decision Im considering 
whether or not Vacation Finances responses to Mr and Mrs Bs section 140A claims 
were fair and reasonable in the circumstances (Im not determining the outcome of 
the claims that theyve made under section 140A as only a court would be able to do 
that);
Vacation Finance says that it paid no commission to the holiday company and Ive 
not been provided with any evidence to show that it paid a commission to the holiday 
company in connection with either of Mr and Mrs Bs loan;
Vacation Finance said in its February 2022 final response letters to Mr and Mrs Bs 
representative that it followed its usual process and conducted appropriate 
affordability assessments before the loans were made to Mr and Mrs B but it hasnt 
provided any other information about those affordability assessments  and it says 
that the October 2017 loan was repaid in February 2018 and that Mr and Mrs B were 
fully up to date with their instalment payments for the October 2018 loan at that time;
Mr and Mrs B have provided bank account, credit card account and savings account 
statements, copies of their credit reports and a detailed explanation of their financial 
situation  they say that they re-mortgaged their house in December 2017 to pay-off 
their May 2016 loan which provided an additional £53,000 and they used that to pay 
£22,320 to Vacation Finance in February 2018 as the final payment on the October 
2017 loan and £10,500 was paid to the holiday company as the deferred payment  
and the re-mortgage resulted in their monthly mortgage payment increasing from 
£357.70 to £626.37;
Mr B says that he drew down £21,495.27 from his pension plan in November 2019 to 
help clear their debts and that he took out a personal loan for £18,500 in August 
2020 to ease some of their financial pressures and that they re-mortgaged again in 
May 2021 to clear outstanding loans and credit card bills which had built up due to 
the financial constraints of their loans which were costing them £448 each month - 
which provided them with £31,290 but resulted in their monthly mortgage payment 
increasing to £884.25;
if Mr and Mrs B werent able to afford the loan that theyd taken out in May 2016, I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them not to have entered into the 
membership application agreement to acquire a vacation week in October 2017 at a 
total cost of £35,500  but they repaid the May 2016 loan in December 2017 and 
repaid the October 2017 loan in February 2018;if Mr and Mrs B werent able to afford the loans that theyd taken out in May 2016 and 
October 2017, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them not to have 
entered into the membership application agreement to acquire another vacation 
week in October 2018 at a total cost of a further £42,000;
Ive carefully considered all of the information that Mr and Mrs B have provided about 
their financial situation but I dont consider that it shows that they couldnt afford the 
loans when they were made to them, that the loan agreements were mis-sold to them 
or that Vacation Finance lent to them irresponsibly;
Mr and Mrs Bs representatives January 2022 claims letters both say that it was 
represented to Mr and Mrs B that: they should consider making another purchase of 
a more premium product which would be easier to sell as part of the holiday 
company's re-sale scheme and make a higher profit for them; and the product was 
available at a special price but only if purchased on that day;
Mr and Mrs B said in the document detailing their dealings with the holiday company 
and how they were sold the holiday products which they included with their February 
2021 letter to Vacation Finance that the discussions in October 2017 included the 
rental programme and they came away with the expectation that they could put the 
vacation week on the rental programme from 2019 and to get the full price, expected 
in the region of £4,000 to £6,000, they should ensure that they emailed their request 
in January 2018  and that they were told in October 2018 that the sales price for the 
unit that they were acquiring was expected to be in the region of £90,000;
Mr and Mrs B said in response to Vacation Finances final response letters that the 
holiday company was very clever at promoting the sales as investments and the 
majority of the time that they were with its representatives was going through sales 
figures and investment figures rather than the benefits of the memberships but all of 
the figures shown to them were removed and they werent allowed to take them with 
them;
Mr and Mrs B have provided the first page of the membership application 
agreements that they signed in October 2017 and 2018 but not the terms and 
conditions that are referred to in those agreements  and the October 2017 
agreement is clearly shown as compromising of four pages but theyve not provided 
pages two to four of it;
I consider it to be likely that Mr and Mrs B would also have signed other documents 
with the holiday company in October 2017 and October 2018 but Ive not been 
provided with any of those documents  the only other documents from those times 
that I have seen are the loan agreements with Vacation Finance that they signed in 
October 2017 and October 2018;
other than the information described above, none of Mr and Mrs B and their 
representative has provided a detailed account of the circumstances in which the 
alleged misrepresentations were made, the conversations that took place or the 
information that was provided to Mr and Mrs B before they entered into the 
agreements or any documentary or other evidence in support of Mr and Mrs Bs 
claims about the representations that were made to them;
our investigator said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship 
between Mr and Mrs B and Vacation Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded 
that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair, and in 
responding to those recommendations, I dont consider that Mr and Mrs B and their 
representative have provided further evidence to show that the vacation weeks were 
misrepresented to Mr and Mrs B;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the vacation weeks 
were misrepresented or mis-sold to Mr and Mrs B by the holiday company or that 
they were induced into entering into the membership application agreements by any 
such misrepresentations;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the vacation weeks 
were marketed or sold to Mr and Mrs B as investments so I dont consider that 
theres been any breach of regulation as claimed by their representative;
Mr and Mrs B had bought a holiday product from the holiday company in May 2016 
so I would expect them to have been prepared for the sales tactics that might be 
used by the holiday company before they went into the sales presentation in October 
2017 and that, if they didnt want to acquire the vacation week, they would have 
made that clear to the holiday company at that time;
their complaint form relating to the October 2017 loan says that the holiday company 
unduly pressured them into entering into the membership application agreement and 
the loan agreement and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure them 
(and the same complaint is made in the complaint form relating to the October 2018 
loan), but if that was the case I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them 
not to have then entered into another membership application agreement to acquire 
another vacation week from the holiday company in October 2018;
Mr and Mrs B had the right to withdraw from the membership application agreements 
and from the loan agreements within fourteen days without giving any reason but 
they say that they didnt make use of the fourteen day cooling off period as they 
believed that they had made a good investment;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs B were 
unduly pressured into acquiring the vacation weeks in October 2017 and October 
2018 or entering into the loan agreements or that the holiday company used 
unacceptably aggressive commercial practices against them;
Mr and Mrs Bs complaint form says that they werent provided with key information 
necessary for them to be able to make informed decisions regarding their purchases 
and the submission made in response to our investigators recommendation says 
that the holiday company had a responsibility to give them information about the 
value on the open market of the products being purchased and their likely future 
value on the open market  but Im not persuaded that the holiday company was 
required to give them those values;
none of Mr and Mrs B and their representative has identified any other information 
that was necessary for them to make an informed decision regarding the purchases 
but that wasnt provided to them by the holiday company (and I dont consider that 
theyve provided all of the documentation that would have been provided to Mr and 
Mrs B by the holiday company at the times of their acquisitions);
Mr and Mrs Bs representative says that the terms of the agreement are so egregious 
as to be unfair and the submission made in response to our investigators 
recommendation says that Mr and Mrs B were responsible for paying maintenance 
charges and failure to pay them would result in termination of the membership with 
no refund  but it hasnt provided a copy of the terms and conditions or identified 
which of the terms and conditions it considers to be unfair;
it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the terms in the 
agreements that Mr and Mrs B entered into in October 2017 and October 2018 are 
unfair but I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term 
alone is likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair 
relationship between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the 
relationship to be unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
agreements have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr and Mrs B and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the agreements created an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs B and 
Vacation Finance;
Mr and Mrs B said in their response to Vacation Finances final response letters that 
any advance payment by a consumer is prohibited during the withdrawal period but 
they made an advance payment of £10,500 relating to the vacation week that they 
acquired in October 2017  although they agreed to make an advance payment in 
October 2017, theyve said in the evidence that theyve provided that the advance 
payment was deferred and that they didnt pay it until after theyd re-mortgaged their 
house in December 2017 so Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that the holiday company acted incorrectly in connection with the advance payment;
Mr and Mrs B proposed to Vacation Finance in February 2021 that they hand back 
the membership certificate for the vacation week that theyd acquired in October 
2018 and write-off the money that theyd already paid for the loan and that Vacation 
Finance should terminate the loan agreement - it said that it was, in principle, happy 
to meet with those proposals but there was additional finance with another finance 
provider and it suggested that they discuss their options with the new operating 
company of the holiday club;
Mr and Mrs B say that they made the same complaint and proposal to the other 
finance provider but they didnt pursue it any further as they were in discussions with 
an adviser about exiting their memberships and were instructed not to have any 
further communications with their finance providers;
their representative then made claims to Vacation Finance about the October 2017 
and October 2018 loans under sections 75 and 140A and it said that it didnt uphold 
any of their complaints;
I dont consider that Vacation Finances statement that it was, in principle, happy to 
meet with Mr and Mrs Bs proposals shows that the relationship between Mr and 
Mrs B and Vacation Finance was unfair, that their complaint about its response to 
their sections 140A claim should be upheld or that it would be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require it to accept those proposals;
having considered all of the information and evidence that Mr and Mrs B and their 
representative have provided, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that Mr and Mrs Bs relationship with Vacation Finance was unfair and I dont 
consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr and Mrs B and Vacation Finance in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs B for the issues that theyve had with their vacation 
weeks but I consider that Vacation Finances response to the claims that had been 
made to it was fair and reasonable in the circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Vacation Finance to 
refund to Mr and Mrs B any of the money that theyve paid under the loan 
agreements, to cancel the October 2018 loan, to pay them any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Bs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision before 8 January 2024.
