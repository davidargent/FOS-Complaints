(* highest repayment, including overlapping loans)
Our adjudicator partly upheld Miss Ts complaint and thought loans 8 and 9 shouldnt have 
been given. Miss T disagreed and said she thought several of the other loans shouldnt have 
been given. She asked for an ombudsman to review her complaint. 
Lending Stream agreed with the adjudicators conclusions.
I issued a provisional decision for the complaint on 8 August 2020, and Ive summarised my 
provisional findings below:
Our adjudicator didnt think it was unreasonable for Lending Stream to provide loans 1 
to 7 to Miss T. He also considered loan 10 represented a new chain of lending, 
because it was taken over seven months after loan 9 had been repaid. The adjudicator 
didnt find it was unreasonable for Lending Stream to arrange loans 10 and 11.
But the adjudicator considered Lending Stream shouldnt have arranged loans 8 and 
9. He said that by loan 8, Miss Ts pattern of borrowing suggested shed become 
persistently reliant on short-term loans. Shed taken eight loans in just under six 
months, and the amounts she was borrowing werent decreasing significantly. By 
loan 8, Miss Ts highest repayment amount had more than doubled. The adjudicator 
concluded that the pattern of lending itself by loan 8 meant that loans 8 and 9 werent 
sustainable. 
I didnt think it was unreasonable for Lending Stream to arrange loans 1 to 4 for Miss 
T. The loans were arranged during the early part of the lending relationship, and 
seem to have been affordable to Miss T based on the checks Lending Stream carried 
out. The loans were repaid in line with the loan agreements. 
I also thought it was reasonable for Lending Stream to arrange loans 10 and 11 for 
Miss T. Loan 10 was taken out more than seven months after loan 9 was repaid. So I 
considered loan 10 represented a new lending chain. As such, it wasnt 
unreasonable for loans 10 and 11 to be arranged by Lending Stream.
I didnt think it was reasonable for Lending Stream to arrange loan 5 for Miss T. This 
was her fifth instalment loan in just over five months, and was taken out a few days 
after shed repaid loan 4. So I thought it wouldve been reasonable for Lending 
Stream to carry out more detailed checks into Miss Ts finances. 
Lending Stream had asked Miss T about her income and outgoings and checked her 
credit file. But I thought it wouldve been reasonable for Lending Stream to verify 
what Miss T had told it about her income and outgoings. 
Had it done so, I thought Lending Stream wouldve discovered that Miss T had been 
in a debt management plan since June 2017. She was still making payments towards 
that plan when loan 5 was taken in August 2018. 
In addition, from Miss Ts bank statements it appeared that in the month before loan 
5 was arranged shed taken four other short-term loans from another lender. So I 
thought it wouldve been reasonable for Lending Stream to conclude that loan 5 was 
unlikely to be sustainable for Miss T.
Loans 6 and 7 were both taken within a few days of loan 5 and while loan 5 remained 
open. So I thought it wouldve been reasonable for Lending Stream to verify what 
Miss T had told it about her finances when those loans were taken too. And it 
wouldve discovered the same information that was available when loan 5 was 
arranged.
So I considered it wouldve been reasonable for Lending Stream to conclude that 
loans 6 and 7 were unlikely to be sustainable for Miss T.
I looked at the overall pattern of Lending Streams lending history with Miss T, to see 
whether there was a point at which Lending Stream should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Lending Stream 
should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ts case, I thought that point was reached 
by loan 8. 
I thought by that point Lending Stream ought to have realised Miss T was not 
managing to repay her loans sustainably. Miss T had taken out 6 loans in just over 3 
months (from the date loan 3 was taken). Loan 8 was also taken while loans 6 and 7 
remained open. So Lending Stream ought to have realised it was more likely than not 
Miss T was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loans 
was leaving in her finances and that Miss Ts indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
I thought Miss T lost out because Lending Stream continued to provide borrowing 
from loan 8 to loan 9 because:
- those loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ts indebtedness by 
allowing her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an 
extended period of time.
- the number of loans that Miss T borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So I said I intended to uphold the complaint about loans 5 to 7 and also loans 8 and 9.
Miss T said she agreed with my provisional findings and didnt have anything further to add.
Lending Stream didnt make any further representations in response to my provisional 
decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
In the absence of any further representations from the parties, I see no reason to depart 
from the position set out in my provisional decision.
I still dont think Lending Stream shouldve provided loans 5 to 9, and Ive set out below what 
it should do to put things right.
Putting things right
Lending Stream should:
refund all interest and charges Miss T paid on loans 5 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 5, 6 and 7 from Miss Ts credit file;the number of loans taken by loan 8 means any information recorded about loans 8 
and 9 is adverse. So all entries about loans 8 and 9 should be removed from Miss Ts 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. 
Lending Stream must give Miss T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she 
asks for one.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I direct Gain Credit LLC (trading as 
Lending Stream) to pay Miss T compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 November 2020.
