Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ms complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because Mr M wasnt managing  his money. Sunny disagreed  but 
offered to write of Mr Ms outstanding balance. Mr M didnt accept this offer.  
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN68625512the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.  Having done so, Im partially  upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 3. Mr M 
didnt respond  to the view. As there is no dispute with the adjudicators opinion about  these 
loans, I wont be making  any findings  on them.
Sunny says it carried out checks before  it lent loan 4 to Mr M and the results  of these checks 
didnt raise any concerns.  But as this was Mr Ms fourth loan in less than three months and 
for a larger amount, I think Sunny should have been looking to build  a clearer  picture about 
Mr Ms finances before lending him this loan.  
At the time of taking  out loan 4, Mr Ms declared income was £1,815. He stated his 
outgoings were  £1,612.  Which left him with a disposable income of £203.  All his previous 
loans were also still outstanding so the combined  repayment  for all of these including loan 4 
would have been £211.16 which would have  been  more than Mr Ms available disposable  
income. Sunny ought to have realised  this and the likelihood that Mr M wouldnt be able to 
manage his loans sustainably without having to borrow again. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think that this point was reached by loan 7. I say 
this because: 
Ref: DRN68625513At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr M was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr M had taken  out seven  loans in six months.  So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely  that Mr Ms indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. 
From  loan 7 onwards  Mr M was provided with a new loan within weeks of taking out 
his previous one. 
He also wasnt really  making any inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 12 
was taken out around ten months  after his first and was for a larger amount. Mr M 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny provided  borrowing for loan 7 onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness  by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny should  do the following in regard to loan 4 onwards. 
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts Sunny should buy these back  if Sunny is able to do 
so and then take the following steps.  If Sunny cant buy the debts back, then Sunny should 
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results outlined  below.
A) Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made by Mr M towards interest,  
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including  anything 
Sunny has already refunded.
B) Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by 
Mr M which were  considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr M originally made 
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should  remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr M as though they had been  
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr M having  made  
overpayments then Sunny should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results  in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Mr M. However,  if there is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr M. Sunny shouldnt 
pursue outstanding balances made  up of principal Sunny has already written-off.
Ref: DRN68625514E) Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  recorded on Mr Ms credit file in relation to 
loans 4, 5 and 6. The overall pattern of Mr Ms borrowing for loans 7 to 12 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans  entirely 
from Mr Ms credit file. Sunny  does not have  to remove any outstanding loans from Mr Ms 
credit file until these have been  repaid, but Sunny should still remove any adverse  
information recorded about these  loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr M a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 May 2020.
