The complaint
Mr R complains that NewDay Ltd didnt raise a chargeback for a cancelled booking when 
this had been previously agreed.
What happened
Mr R brought a separate complaint to our service previously about NewDay Ltd about a 
chargeback. In that complaint, NewDay Ltd accepted they had incorrectly told Mr R that they 
couldnt raise a chargeback on the transaction in question as it had been brought outside of 
the timescales permitted by the card scheme.
NewDay Ltd agreed to pay Mr R £75 for their error and said they would raise the chargeback 
upon suitable evidence from him that a refund would be provided if the booking was 
cancelled.
Mr R then asked NewDay Ltd to raise the chargeback which they agreed to do but only once 
he sent them our findings on the previous complaint. Mr R complained to NewDay about this 
and was told that he needed to liaise with our service, which he then did.  
Mr Rs complaint was passed to one of our investigators. NewDay Ltd sent their business file 
to our investigator and told him that they accepted they had incorrectly told Mr R to contact 
us when they had already agreed to raise a chargeback for him. So, NewDay Ltd offered to 
credit Mr Rs account with the amount hed paid for the booking which was cancelled, and to 
pay him £50 for the inconvenience theyd caused him.
Our investigator recommended that NewDay Ltd should pay Mr R a further £50 which they 
accepted. Mr R though felt this didnt fairly reflect the time hed spent on this matter and the 
inconvenience hed been caused. He felt a total of £200 was fairer, which included the 
refunded amount for the cancelled booking. 
As agreement couldnt be reached, Mr R asked for his complaint to be referred to an 
ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay Ltd has agreed to refund the cost of the cancelled booking to Mr Rs account. So, 
the underlying financial loss that Mr R sought to reclaim is no longer something I need to 
consider, apart from me saying that NewDay Ltd should ensure that they refund this as 
agreed and without delay if they have not already done so. 
The remaining issue is around the compensation due to Mr R for the time he spent dealing 
with this matter and the inconvenience this caused him. I certainly appreciate that this 
dispute has been compounded by NewDay Ltd making several errors which has led to Mr R 
bringing two complaints to us. Overall, I think £100 is a fair amount for the inconvenience 
caused to Mr R for this particular complaint, noting that Mr R has previously been paid 
compensation under the previous, separate complaint.  
Putting things right
If they have not already done so, NewDay Ltd should pay Mr R compensation for the 
inconvenience hes been caused by them not handling his chargeback request appropriately 
and should refund the amount Mr R sought to claim by chargeback. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to do the following (if they have not already 
done so):
Refund £44.99 which was the amount Mr R wanted raised as a chargeback; and
Pay Mr R £100 for the inconvenience this matter has caused him. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 November 2023.
