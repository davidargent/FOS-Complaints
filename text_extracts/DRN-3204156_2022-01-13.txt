The complaint
Ms C complained to National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) when they reported a 
payment arrangement on her loan to the credit reference agencies, despite a payment 
deferral having been agreed.
What happened
Ms C had arranged a loan with NatWest. Due to the financial impact of the global pandemic, 
Ms C asked NatWest to provide a payment deferral on her loan during 2020. NatWest 
agreed to Ms Cs request and her loan repayments due in April, May and June 2020 were 
deferred.
In late 2020, Ms C obtained a copy of her credit file from a credit reference agency. She 
noticed that NatWest had reported a payment arrangement in respect of her loan. Ms C 
thought NatWest shouldnt have done this. She said the Financial Conduct Authoritys 
guidance said that firms shouldnt report these payment holidays.
Ms C decided to complain to NatWest about what theyd done. She wanted them to make a 
public apology, put her credit file right and pay compensation.
NatWest responded to Ms Cs complaint. They agreed they shouldnt have recorded the 
payment arrangement on her credit file. They confirmed theyd requested all adverse data be 
removed from her file for the period 1 January to 31 December 2020. They also paid 
compensation of £100 to Ms C for the distress an inconvenience their mistake had caused. 
They also offered to consider any external costs such as call costs or loss of earnings due 
to their mistake.
Ms C wasnt happy with NatWest response. So, she referred her complaint to this service. 
She wanted confirmation NatWest had checked all their records to ensure no other 
customers had been impacted. She also wanted NatWest to be fined by the FCA. She asked 
for her credit file to be amended and sought a formal apology by a senior member of 
NatWests management. She also thought the compensation paid wasnt enough to cover 
the problems and stress caused.
One of our adjudicators investigated Ms Cs complaint. He thought NatWest had responded 
fairly and reasonably. So, he didnt think they needed to do anything more. Ms C wasnt 
happy with our adjudicators findings. So as an agreement couldnt be reached, her 
complaint was referred to me to issue a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
To clarify, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued guidance to lenders on 2 April 2020 
which explained what it expected from businesses during the exceptional circumstances 
arising out of the global pandemic. It provided guidance asking businesses to consider 
payment deferrals of up to three months under regulated credit agreements. 
The FCA said their guidance applied where consumers were already experiencing or 
reasonably expect to experience temporary payment difficulties as a result of the pandemic. 
The FCA also said that firms should ensure that there is no negative impact on the 
consumers credit file because of the payment deferral.  
At the outset, I believe its important to explain the role of this service when considering Ms 
Cs complaint here. 
It isnt the role of this service to supervise, regulate or impose fines on any business. Its also 
not our role to ask a business to alter its procedures or processes or impose improvements 
on the level of service offered to their customers. These aspects fall firmly within the remit of 
the regulator  in this case, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 
But it is our role to examine and decide whether a business has been fair and reasonable in 
the manner in which those policies and procedures are applied in the individual 
circumstances of Ms Cs experience with them. When considering her complaint, Ive also 
considered any relevant rules and regulations set down by the FCA in their handbook  
where they apply. 
NatWest have agreed they made a mistake in Ms Cs circumstances. They confirmed theyd 
agreed a payment deferral, and this shouldnt have been recorded on her credit file with the 
credit reference agencies. I think this was the right thing for them to do here. NatWest have 
also confirmed to this service theyve arranged for any late payment markers to be removed 
from Ms Cs credit file. I have no reason to doubt whether this has been done.
Ive seen evidence to confirm NatWest paid compensation of £100 to Ms Cs bank account 
on 22 January 2021. Compensation is a personal thing. What is seen as reasonable by one 
party may not be considered so by another. Ms C did experience some inconvenience and 
distress. But I think the amount offered feels fair in all the circumstances here. Having 
complained, NatWest appear to have acted to put things right. I appreciate that Ms C doesnt 
agree. But it isnt the role of this service to make awards in order to penalise NatWest for 
their mistakes. Any award is considered based upon the impact NatWests mistake had upon 
Ms C. And I think NatWests offer does that here.
Ms C wants NatWest to undertake a complete review to identify other customers who may 
be impacted. It isnt this services role to instruct NatWest to do that. This service can only 
consider the circumstances of the complaint Ms C referred to us. And thats what weve done 
here.
I do appreciate Ms C will be disappointed, but I shant be asking NatWest to do anything 
more. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Ms Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 February 2022.
