The complaint
Mr B is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wont reimburse the money that Mr B 
paid for an item that Mr B bought which he refused delivery of under their Buyer Protection 
scheme.
What happened
Mr B made an online purchase. Before the item was delivered, Mr B tried to cancel the 
purchase with the vendor, but the item had already been dispatched. 
A courier attempted to deliver the item, but Mr B refused delivery. However, the courier 
incorrectly recorded that the item had been delivered.
Mr B contacted PayPal and requested a refund for the item under their Buyer Protection 
scheme. But PayPal declined this request because the item was recorded as being delivered 
by the courier. Mr B wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mr Bs complaint, but while they noted that Mr B had provided an email 
from the courier which states that an item wasnt delivered, they also noted that the email 
was written in generic terms and didnt make reference to a specific item such that it could 
be confirmed that it was referring to the item in question. So, PayPal didnt uphold Mr Bs 
complaint and requested more specific information to be provided from the courier.
Mr B wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but they didnt feel that PayPal had acted 
unfairly in asking for a more item specific confirmation of what had taken place, so they 
didnt uphold this complaint.
Mr B remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I find that Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator here, and for 
essentially the same reasons.
Mr B feels that PayPal should uphold his request for a refund, whereas PayPal dont feel that 
an adequate level of information has been provided to them to enable them to consider this.
Having reviewed all the information available to me, I find it difficult to find fault with PayPal 
here. And this is especially the case given that the courier recorded the item as delivered 
and the email sent by the courier to Mr B doesnt make a specific reference to the individual 
item or delivery in question  as would be reasonably required by PayPal for them to 
consider this matter further - but instead uses general terms. 
Additionally, it also appears from the email that the courier has accepted responsibility for 
what took place here and have agreed to reimburse Mr B the cost of the item - such that Mr 
B no longer has need to seek a reimbursement from the vendor, or from PayPal.
So, its difficult to see how PayPal have acted unreasonably of unfairly here, and it wouldnt 
be expected that PayPal would reimburse Mr B for an item when a reimbursement for that 
item has already been agreed by another party. 
Indeed, considering this information, it now wouldnt be unexpected that PayPal would 
require confirmation from the courier that no such reimbursement has been or will be 
provided in order to progress Mr Bs claim with them any further, should they consider doing 
so.
It also wouldnt be expected by this service that PayPal would reimburse any transaction 
fees to Mr B, even should it be confirmed that the specific item was never delivered, and I 
say this because a PayPal transaction did take place.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that Mr B was wanting here, but it follows that it wont 
be upholding this complaint or asking PayPal to take any further action at this time. I hope 
that Mr B can understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I 
have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 August 2021.
