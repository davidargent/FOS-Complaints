K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs S complain  that Black  Horse Limited  hasnt administered  their loan account 
properly. They say the current balance is far higher  than it should be and the loan shouldve 
been paid off after 10 years.
background
Mr and Mrs S say the balance on their loan is higher than it should be and the loan shouldve 
been paid off by now. They say Black  Horse shouldnt be allowed to extend  their loan term 
and it hasnt explained why they still owe more than £6,000.
Black Horse  rejected these parts of Mr and Mrs S complaint. It says Mr and Mrs S borrowed 
£26,295 in September 2008. And the interest charged at the outset was £17,809.  It says that 
the total amount  just over £44,000   wouldve been repaid over ten years  if Mr and Mrs S 
had made  all their monthly payments on time and theyd not taken any payment  holidays.
It explained that it had decided in 2012  that the PPI had been mis-sold  and it refunded this in 
full. It also says that it upheld a previous  complaint in 2016  and credited  Mr and Mrs S 
account with more than £9,000. But it says the outstanding balance  is correct and is a result  
of arrears on the account; it says by the time it sold the loan in June 2014,  Mr and Mrs S had 
only made repayments of £12,700, but they shouldve  made  payments of more than 
£18,300.
Black Horse  did uphold one part of Mr and Mrs S complaint  it acknowledged it shouldve  
better explained the effect of payment holidays on Mr and Mrs S loan balance  when  they 
took these payment breaks in 2008 and 2009. And because of this, it credited the account 
with £1,500. And it confirmed the outstanding balance on the account as at 23 October  
2018.
Our adjudicator looked at this complaint and said she didnt think it should be upheld. She 
acknowledged that Black  Horse  had made  a number of mistakes with the account  but she 
recognised what  it had done  to put things right.  And she explained that she didnt think it 
needed to do anything more.
Mr and Mrs S disagreed, so the complaint comes to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I hope that Mr and Mrs S wont take it as 
a discourtesy that Ive condensed their complaint in the way that I have. Ours is an informal  
dispute resolution service,  and Ive concentrated on what I consider to be the crux of the 
complaint. Our rules allow  me to do that. Mr and Mrs S should note, however, that although I 
may not address each individual point  that theyve raised, I have  given careful consideration 
to all of their submissions before arriving at my decision.
Having considered the evidence, Im afraid I have to tell Mr and Mrs S that I think the 
adjudicator reached  entirely the right outcome here.
Ive been able to look at the loan agreement signed by Mr and Mrs S in 2008 and Ive seen 
screenshots of all the loan transactions as well. Ive also had sight of copies of the 
Ref: DRN88890442correspondence that Black Horse  sent to Mr and Mrs S; account statements, arrears  letters  
and default notices from the time the account opened in 2008 to the time when it was sold to 
a third party in June 2014.
The loan agreement  shows  that Mr and Mrs S took out a loan in September 2008. The loan 
was for £19,000 over a period of at least ten years. And at the same  time they purchased  a 
payment protection insurance (PPI) policy. The PPI policy  cost just over £7,000 and this 
was added to the balance  at the start of the loan. The loan agreement shows  that both the 
loan and the PPI premium  wouldve  been  charged interest  totalling  nearly  £18,000. This 
means that if Mr and Mrs S made  all their monthly  loan payments on time and the loan ran 
for the minimum term of ten years, then they wouldve repaid a total of just over £44,000.
Over the next six years, Mr and Mrs S missed a number of monthly payments; interest 
continued to be charged and collection activity  fees were charged for each failed  direct  debit. 
Mr and Mrs S also took a couple of payment holidays  permitted payment breaks in 
accordance with the loan terms and conditions  where no monthly payment was required, 
but interest on the outstanding balance continued to accrue.
Black Horse  agreed that Mr and Mrs S had been mis-sold their PPI policy  and it refunded the 
costs of the policy in accordance with the way that wed expect them  to:
It cancelled the policy and credited the account  with the unused future part of the PPI 
policy.
And it calculated how much PPI Mr and Mrs S had already paid for - £2,790. It 
credited this sum to the loan account along with interest that had accrued because a 
prior loan also had PPI - £1,647.
And it credited  the account with statutory interest at 8%.
This reduced  the loan balance by more  than £5,000.
I can see the money was then sent to Mr and Mrs S; a cheque  for £5,034.44 was sent,  
payable to Mrs S and I understand this was cashed  on 20 August  2012. Because this money  
was taken out of the account  and sent to Mr and Mrs S, it had the effect of increasing  the 
balance by £5,034.44.
In June 2014, Black Horse says it sold the loan to a third party.  At this point it says the 
outstanding balance on the account was more than £25,000, including  arrears. This was 
because although  Mr and Mrs S had repaid nearly £13,000 since the loan started, they 
shouldve repaid more than £18,000  by this time. So the loan transferred to a third party  with 
arrears of more than £5,000. And Im satisfied that this is correct based  on the loan 
statements and loan paperwork Ive seen.  
In 2016 Mr and Mrs S raised  a complaint with Black Horse about how it had dealt with them 
when they were in financial  difficulty and Black  Horse upheld  their complaint. It said it would 
cancel the £950 in fees that had been applied to the account and refund more than £8,000 in 
interest charges.  And it notified  the third party and instructed it to make an adjustment  to Mr 
and Mrs S loan account balance  in July 2016.
In October  2018, Black  Horse partially  upheld a further complaint from Mr and Mrs S. It 
acknowledged that when Mr and Mrs S took payment holidays on their account in 2008 and 
2009, it shouldve  explained to them the effect of these payment holidays on the account  
Ref: DRN88890443and the account balance.  And it says it was wrong  that it didnt do this, so it asked the third 
party that manages Mr and Mrs S account to credit their loan account with a further £1,500.
Black Horse  says that prior to the £1,500 being applied to their account; it confirmed to Mr 
and Mrs S that their current  balance  was £6,625.06. This means that once the £1,500 was 
applied, the current  balance wouldve been  just over £5,000.
Based on everything  Ive seen, Im satisfied that the outstanding balance  on this loan 
account is correct. Im further satisfied that Black  Horse has done what  it needs to do to 
correct earlier mistakes  and I dont think it needs to do anything more.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision  before  15 August 2019.
