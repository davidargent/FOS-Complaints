The complaint
Mr M complains that MBNA Limited wont refund to him the amount that hes claimed from it 
relating to a hotel booking.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr M used his MBNA credit card in November 2019 to book and pay in advance for 
two double hotel rooms for five nights but the rooms that were provided had a double 
bed that was fixed in the corner of the room so he said that they werent suitable for 
two people;
he complained to the hotel but he says that it told him that there were no other rooms 
available so the rooms were only used for one night and Mr M and the other 
members of his party left the hotel after that;
the hotel refused Mr Ms request for a refund so he made a claim to MBNA under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 but, though it appreciated the 
inconvenience of a double bed being up against the wall, it said that that didnt 
constitute a breach of contract;
Mr M then complained to this service but our investigator said that hed been unable 
to evidence that there was a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the hotel;
Mr M has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman and says that 
it would be an implied term of the contract that the accommodation provided would 
be of a standard of cleanliness and quality reasonably to be expected from this type 
and price of hotel;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ms complaint about MBNA, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the hotel and that MBNAs 
response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not 
determining the outcome of Mr Ms claim under section 75 as only a court would be 
able to do that;
Mr M clearly feels very strongly that the bed in the rooms was unacceptable so he 
should receive the amount that hes claimed for the cost of the alternative 
accommodation that the party used (or the amount by which the hotel gained from 
the rooms that hed paid for not being used);
I sympathise with Mr M for the issues that hes experienced and for the frustration 
that he clearly feels, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
theres been a breach of contract by the hotel or that the hotel misrepresented the 
rooms to him;
Mr M booked and paid for two double rooms and he was provided with two rooms, 
each of which had a double bed and, although I understand his disappointment about 
the configuration of the bed, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that the hotel has breached any implied term about the quality of the accommodation;
I consider that it was reasonable for Mr M to expect that the beds would be 
accessible from both sides but I dont consider that thats enough to show that the 
hotel breached its contract with him by providing rooms with a double bed that was 
fixed in the corner;
I dont consider that the hotel fraudulently misrepresented or carelessly 
misrepresented the rooms as claimed by Mr M and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that it misrepresented the rooms to him; 
MBNA would only be liable to Mr M under section 75 if there had been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the hotel  the hotel may have benefited from Mr M 
and his party leaving the hotel because it didnt provide them with the breakfast that 
was included and it may have been able to use the rooms for other guests but, as I 
dont consider that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation, MBNA 
has no liability to reimburse Mr M for any such benefit that the hotel has received; 
I consider that MBNA has responded fairly and reasonably to Mr Ms claim; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
MBNA to refund to Mr M any of the money that hes claimed, to pay him any other 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 February 2021.
