K820x#14complaint
Miss R says AXA France IARD (AXA)  mis-sold  her a payment protection insurance (PPI)  
policy. 
I cant consider this complaint against  the policy seller directly because  the sale took place 
before it, or its predecessor-in-title, was regulated by the then Financial Services Authority 
(FSA) for insurance intermediation activities, or otherwise covered by our jurisdiction.
The party that at the time of the sale was the policy insurer, has accepted that the seller  was 
acting as its agent at the time  so it accepted responsibility for the sale. Following a transfer 
of business, AXA has taken on that responsibility. To keep things simple, Ill only refer to 
AXA in this decision, rather than any other business.
background and summary to complaint
Miss R bought the policy in 1999  at the same time as taking out a hire-purchase  agreement. 
She applied  for the hire-purchase agreement and PPI policy in store. 
The policy provided  cover  for accident, sickness, unemployment, hospitalisation and life  
subject to its exclusions and limitations. It offered to repay the monthly  repayment  of 
Miss Rs hire-purchase agreement in the event of Miss R being unable  to work due to 
accident, sickness or unemployment. 
The policy cost £2.24 a month  and the premium  would  continue to have to be paid in the 
event of a successful claim. 
According to AXAs records  Miss R paid a total of £20.16 for PPI during the policys  lifetime.
At the time,  Miss R was employed as a staff nurse.  She has told us she was entitled  to full 
sick pay for 12 months or more, death  in service benefit and didnt  have any other means  of 
repaying her hire-purchase agreement should she be unable to work. Miss R has said she 
had no medical  conditions at the time of the sale. 
Miss Rs representative has made  lengthy and substantial representations  on her behalf.
 
I will not restate them all here, but I have  read and considered  them all carefully. In 
summary, Miss Rs representative says:
AXA failed to meet the sales standards which applied at the time. In those 
circumstances, applying  the regulators rules and guidance for businesses  on 
handling PPI complaints  under  DISP  App 3, it should be presumed Miss R wouldnt 
have taken out the policy and the complaint should be upheld.  Miss Rs 
representatives believe there to be no evidence to rebut that presumption;
The policy excluded or limited claims for back pain and stress,  which  are some  of the 
most common reasons people  are off work. This significantly reduced  the value of 
cover;
The true costs including interest  and the fact it was unlikely you could make  a 
successful claim  meant the policy was of inherently poor value as shown by the low 
Ref: DRN96223592claims ratio. The common law duty of utmost good  faith means AXA should have told 
Miss R about the poor value; 
The common law duty of utmost good faith also means AXA should have explained 
the significance  of the exclusions  and limitations of cover  to Miss R and the impact  
they would  have had on her chances  of making  a claim; and 
 
The information Miss R received was misleading. These policies were promoted  as 
providing peace of mind, but the number of exclusions and limitations on the scope of 
the cover  meant this was untrue.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint be upheld   both parties have seen and 
had the opportunity to provide their responses to the adjudicators opinion. Miss R disagreed 
with the adjudicators opinion for several reasons. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a decision.
my findings
Although I have only included a summary of the complaint, I have read and considered  all 
the evidence and arguments  available  to me from the outset, in order to decide what is, in 
my opinion, fair and reasonable  in all the circumstances of this complaint. 
relevant considerations
When considering  what is fair and reasonable, I am required to take into account: relevant 
law and regulations;  relevant  regulators  rules,  guidance and standards; relevant codes of 
practice; and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the 
time. The Financial Ombudsman Service has set out its general approach to PPI complaints 
on our website and published  some example final decisions that set out in detail how these 
relevant considerations may apply to PPI sales like Miss Rs. I dont intend to set that out in 
much detail here but Ive taken this into account in deciding Miss Rs complaint.
This sale took place  in 1999 before the General Insurance Standards Council (GISC) 
published its code  of practice in June 2000  and before the sale of general insurance 
products like this became  regulated in January 2005. So, the GISC Code, the FSAs (and 
FCAs) overarching Principles for Businesses  and insurance conduct rules (ICOB and 
ICOBs) arent applicable to this complaint,  nor is the FCAs Perimeter  Guidance (PERG). 
The credit agreement itself was with a third-party  and not AXA. That means the unfair  
relationship provisions set out in s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, the Supreme Court  
judgment in Plevin  about s.140 of that Act and the rules and guidance  made by the FCA 
about the handling of complaints  about  the non-disclosure of commission  in light of the 
Plevin judgment, arent  applicable.
There were a number of industry codes in existence  at that time, which I am satisfied are 
applicable to my consideration of what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint: 
The Association of British Insurers General Insurance Business Code of Practice for all 
intermediaries (Including Employees of Insurance Companies) other  than Registered 
Insurance Brokers   The ABI Code.  
Ref: DRN96223593The ABI Code was supplemented by:
Guidance on the application of the ABI Code
The ABI Statement  of Practice for Payment Protection Insurance
The ABI General Business Code of Practice for Telephone Sales, Direct 
Marketing/Direct Mail and the Internet
The Resume for Intermediaries  
Among other  things, the code said that As a condition of membership of the Association  of 
British Insurers (ABI),  members undertake  to enforce this Code  and to use their best 
endeavors to ensure that all those involved in selling their policies observe its provisions. 
AXA was a member  of the ABI and the seller  its agent  was acting as an intermediary. 
The Finance  & Leasing  Association (FLA) Code of Practice
This code  was introduced in 1992,  and set out standards of good  practice  for the
finance and leasing  industry. Section 4 of the code covered  Credit  Protection
Insurance. 
As Ive explained, AXA was a member of the ABI, so it was subject to the ABI Code and its 
associated requirements.  The seller  but not AXA  was a member of the FLA and 
subscribed to the FLA Code, so I consider it reasonable to assume that the seller (as a 
member of the FLA)  should have complied  with its code when selling PPI, and this extends  
to when it was acting as an agent  of AXA. 
So I am satisfied it is right that I should take these codes into account when deciding  what  is, 
in my opinion, fair and reasonable  in the circumstances of Miss Rs case. 
 
Ive also taken account of relevant law in reaching my decision, including:  the law relating to 
negligence, misrepresentation and contract  (including the express  and implied duty on 
professional advisers  to give advice with reasonable skill, care and diligence); the law 
relating to the duty of utmost good faith; and the law relating to causation and remoteness.  
Under the transitional provisions which continue to apply to complaints like this about acts or 
omissions before 1 December 2001,  I am also required to take into account what  
determination the relevant former  scheme   in this case the Insurance  Ombudsman  Bureau 
 might have been expected to reach in relation to an equivalent complaint. I note that under 
the Insurance Ombudsmans terms of reference the Ombudsman was required  to decide 
complaints by reference to what was, in his opinion, fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances  and that the Ombudsman was required  to observe any applicable rule of 
law or relevant judicial  authority. 
I am also mindful of the evidential provisions and guidance set out at DISP App 3, first 
issued by the FSA in 2010, which sets out how firms should handle complaints relating to the 
sale of PPI. This sale took place before insurance mediation became a regulated  activity,  so 
AXA was required to take into account the provisions in DISP App 3 as if they were  guidance  
when considering Miss Rs complaint. 
Ref: DRN96223594key questions
Taking the relevant considerations into account,  it seems to me that the key questions I need  
to consider in deciding  what is in my opinion fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of 
this complaint, are:
-If AXA gave advice,  whether it advised  Miss R with reasonable care and skill  in 
particular, whether the policy  was appropriate  or suitable for her, given her needs 
and circumstances.  
-Whether AXA gave  Miss R sufficient, appropriate and timely  information to enable  
her to make an informed choice about  whether to take out the policy,  including  
drawing to her attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading  way  
the main provisions of the policy and significant  limitations and exclusions.  
-If, having considered  these questions,  I determine the complaint in favour of Miss R, I 
must then go on to consider whether and to what extent Miss R suffered loss or 
damage and what  I consider would amount to fair compensation for that loss or 
damage. 
Having carefully considered the above and the information provided by both Miss R and 
AXA, Ive decided not to uphold Miss Rs complaint. Ive set out my reasoning below. 
did Miss R know  she had a choice?
AXA had to make  it clear that the PPI policy was optional.  
Ive seen a copy  of Miss Rs signed  credit agreement. She was asked to sign separately  if 
she wanted PPI. Miss R signed in the relevant place.
Taking everything into account,  I think its more likely that Miss R knew the policy  was 
optional and she agreed to take it out without undue  pressure. 
did AXA provide advice?
AXA says advice wasnt provided during this sale. Miss R hasnt said either  way.
From the available information  and experience  of how AXA sold PPI generally, Id say its 
likely no advice was provided.
This means  AXA didnt  have to check if the PPI was suitable for Miss R. Instead, it had to 
give her sufficient, appropriate and timely information to enable  Miss R to make an informed 
choice about whether  to take out the policy, including drawing to her attention and 
highlighting  in a clear,  fair and not misleading  way  the main provisions of the policy and 
significant limitations and exclusions. 
the information
Im satisfied its more likely than not Miss R was given a broad description  of what the policy 
was intended  to cover (that is that the policy would protect her payments if Miss R was 
unable to work through accident,  sickness and unemployment) and of the costs. Ive reached  
this conclusion because  the premium was included in the credit  agreement Miss R signed. I 
Ref: DRN96223595also think its unlikely Miss R would  have taken out the policy  without any sense of what the 
policy was for.
But the evidence  from the time of sale doesnt tell us whether  AXA gave sufficient 
information about the actual monthly benefit or about the exclusions or limitations  before 
Miss R agreed to take out the policy. 
So I dont  think AXA gave Miss R sufficient, appropriate and timely information to enable her 
to make an informed choice about  whether  to take out the policy,  including drawing her 
attention and highlighting  in a clear, fair and not misleading way  the main  provisions of 
the policy and significant limitations and exclusions.  
I have considered how my findings interact with the FCAs list of significant  failings  in its 
guidance for firms handling  PPI complaints  set out at DISP  App 3. And for the reasons set 
out above, I am persuaded that there were significant failings in this case.
In addition to the failings  Ive highlighted above,  Miss Rs representative has raised a 
number of general points in regards  to the requirements on a business when providing 
information in PPI sales. It suggests these points apply to all PPI complaints, like Miss Rs. I 
have considered these carefully and summarised  them as:
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  should have 
explained the low claims ratio  what Miss Rs representative considers  to be poor 
value. 
-The common law duty of utmost good faith means the business  shouldnt have just 
told Miss R about  the limitations and exclusions, it should have gone  further  and 
explained the significance of them to her. 
Im not persuaded by Miss Rs representatives  views on this. The duty of utmost good faith 
in insurance law imposed  a duty on both parties to the contract to disclose material facts and 
not to make  material misrepresentations. While I cannot be certain what  a court would say  
I think it is unlikely that a court would find that this extended to the insurer having to disclose 
the claims ratio information  or explaining the significance of the limitations  and exclusions in 
the way Miss R has suggested. And taking into account the law, industry  codes and 
standards of good industry practice  applicable to this complaint, I dont think  it would be fair 
or reasonable to impose such requirements on AXA. 
what effect did AXAs shortcomings have on Miss R? To what extent did Miss R suffer 
loss or damage as a result?
I have found that AXA did not do all it should  have done when it sold this policy  to Miss R. 
So I have  gone  on to consider whether it would be fair and reasonable to conclude Miss R 
suffered loss and damage as a result. To answer  this, I must decide  whether or not Miss R 
would have still taken  out the policy, had AXA done  things properly. 
Miss R says she would  not have  taken it out and believes that I should  presume this to be 
the case given  the significant failings identified above. Ive considered the representations  of 
both sides and the evidence relating to this carefully.
Ref: DRN96223596As this was a non-advised sale, Miss R had to weigh up in her own mind  the cost of the 
policy against the benefits offered and the potential consequences if she didnt insure  
against the risk of being unable to work.  
As Ive found above, Miss R chose to take this policy out. So I consider that its reasonable 
to conclude she had some interest in the benefits  offered by this type of insurance.  But she 
made this decision  based  on incomplete information. So what Miss R thought she was 
getting is not exactly what she got. The extent  to which this differed is a relevant 
consideration when determining if Miss R has suffered any loss or detriment. 
The information Miss R was given about the cost was clear. But the information  about other  
aspects of the policy, such as limitations and exclusions wasnt  as clear as it should have 
been.  
In addition, Im not persuaded  AXA made clear exactly  what Miss R would get back in return 
in the event she made a successful claim. But I think its unlikely Miss Rs expectations 
about what the policy would pay in the event of a claim (an amount  sufficient  to meet  her 
repayments under the hire-purchase agreement) were significantly different to what  the 
policy actually did.
Possibly the most significant differences between what Miss R thought she had bought and 
what she actually bought were the following:
The policy excluded claims relating to medical  conditions that Miss R knew  about or 
ought to have known about,  or which she saw a doctor about  during the 12 months 
before the start date of the policy; 
The policy contained limitations on claims relating to back and mental health 
conditions placing more onerous evidential requirements to support a claim  on those 
grounds;
The policy limited, and in some situations,  excluded unemployment  cover  if Miss R 
wasnt a permanent employee;
There was typically a requirement that in order to be eligible for a disability claim  
Miss R be unable  to do her own job, a similar  job or any paid work which her 
experience, education  or training reasonably  qualified her to do.
I do accept that there is a possibility that the limitations and exclusions above might  well 
have caused Miss R pause for thought  and may well have caused her to conclude  that the 
policy was not as good as she thought  and she might  have  decided  not to proceed.  The 
limitations on the cover, when coupled with the other shortcomings in this sale, might  have 
dissuaded some  consumers in slightly different circumstances from Miss R from taking out 
the policy. 
But, the evidence  about Miss Rs circumstances  at the time of sale shows that the policy  
wasnt fundamentally wrong or unsuitable for her. She was eligible for its benefits and it 
provided cover that, despite its limitations  and exclusions, could have proved valuable  to her 
should the insured risks have become a reality. I also havent seen any evidence to suggest 
she would  have been caught by any of the significant exclusions  Miss R didnt have any 
pre-existing medical conditions and was in permanent employment.  So, I still think she had 
some good  reasons to take the policy out.
I accept back pain and mental health conditions are common problems and the steps 
required to make a disability claim for these conditions were  more onerous than Miss R 
Ref: DRN96223597might reasonably have  expected. But its unlikely [he/she/they] would have expected  to be 
able to make  a disability  claim without  having to provide  some  evidence to support that 
claim. And while this limitation might have  dissuaded  some consumers in slightly  different 
circumstances to Miss R from taking out the policy, Miss R, in [his/her/their] circumstances, 
still had some good reasons to take it out.
If Miss R had known she could only claim for disability  if she was not only unable to do her 
job or any similar job but also unable  to do any work  which  in the insurers  view she might 
reasonably be qualified for, it might have played into her thinking about  what she would  do. 
And I accept  it may have  given her pause for thought  although given Miss Rs 
circumstances, I still think she would have  been interested in taking out the cover. I note 
what Miss Rs said about being  entitled  to 12 months or more  full sick pay, but I think  it was 
likely to be less than that given her position  and length of service at the time (around three 
years). 
Having considered all of the evidence  and arguments in this case, I consider it more likely 
than not that Miss R would still have taken out the policy. The policy was sufficiently close  to 
what it is likely she thought she was getting and provided benefits that would help her 
manage the consequences  were  Miss R made redundant, or unable  to work through  the 
accident or disability.  In the circumstances I consider  it more  likely than not that Miss R 
would have taken  out the policy  in any event notwithstanding the limitations on cover.
Miss Rs representatives say the rules about how to handle PPI complaints (DISP App 3) 
make it clear  that, where  a significant  failing is identified, it should be presumed the 
consumer wouldnt have  taken out PPI, unless  there  is evidence  to outweigh  the 
presumption. They say we should follow this other than in exceptional circumstances.
That guidance is for firms,  but it is a relevant  consideration  so I take it into account along 
with many other things  when I decide  what is in my opinion  fair and reasonable. Considering  
the purpose of the guidance, I dont  think it was ever intended to be at odds with the 
approach I have taken.  
I have thought about what outcome applying the FCAs guidance to this complaint might lead 
to. In the language of DISP App 3, I have found  it would be reasonable to conclude  there  
were substantial flaws  in the sales  process.  In those  circumstances, DISP App 3 says it 
should be presumed Miss R would not have bought the PPI she bought  unless, in the 
particular circumstances  of the complaint, there is evidence to rebut the presumption. 
I am satisfied, applying DISP App 3, it is reasonable to conclude  the presumption  is rebutted 
in the particular facts and circumstances of this complaint. Taking into account Miss Rs 
circumstances as detailed  above, I consider it reasonable to conclude  the position  Miss R 
found herself in as a result of the sale was the same position  she would have been in had 
the breach or significant  failings not occurred. 
Miss R believes  the presumption may only be rebutted when the flaws  in the sales process 
were immaterial, that the flaws in this case were  highly material and we have failed to give 
proper weight to the evidence  including her own comments  that she would not have taken 
out the policy. I am not persuaded by these arguments. 
Even if I am ultimately departing from the guidance  for firms  set out at DISP App 3 (which  I 
dont consider I am), I am only doing so because  I do not consider, in this case,  that it would 
Ref: DRN96223598represent fair compensation to put Miss R in the position she would have been in if she had 
not bought the policy.  
That is because,  while I accept it is possible that Miss R would not have taken out the policy, 
I am satisfied that of the two possibilities,  it is more  likely than not that she would still have  
taken out the PPI had she been  given clear,  fair and not misleading  information about the 
policy she was buying. So Im not persuaded it would  be fair and reasonable in those  
circumstances, to conclude AXA should  pay Miss R compensation, as that would put her in a 
better position than she would  have  been  in if everything had happened as it should have 
done. 
Im also aware that Miss R thinks AXA misrepresented the terms of the policy in how it 
described the PPI. While I accept there is a possibility a court  might  conclude some of AXAs  
statements misrepresented the contract, in my opinion the reason why AXA failed to act 
fairly and reasonably was not because  of what it did or didnt say in the information it 
provided  but because  the overall information  AXA gave Miss R, in the way it did, was 
insufficient to meet  the standards I consider it fair and reasonable to expect it to have met in 
1999 when providing information  about an insurance  policy.  
Ive also thought about the approach Miss Rs representative says a court might take if it 
were to find AXA negligently misrepresented the contract to Miss R and about the remedy  a 
court might award if it were to find that AXA had been in breach of its duty of utmost good 
faith. But this doesnt persuade me to alter my conclusions  about what is fair and reasonable 
in all the circumstances of the complaint  including what I think is fair compensation in the 
circumstances of this case.  For the reasons Ive already set out I dont think it would be fair 
and reasonable to put Miss R in a better position  than if everything  had happened  as it 
should have done. 
my final decision
Overall, having considered all the evidence and arguments to decide what  is, in my opinion, 
fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of this complaint and for the reasons I have set 
out above, I dont  uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 March 2021.
