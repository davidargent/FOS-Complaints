K821x#15complaint
Mrs S has complained about Saga  Services Limiteds handling of her car insurance policy.
In bringing her complaint Mrs S has been  represented by her husband. As Mrs S is the 
policyholder my references  to what she has said includes the comments made by her 
husband on her behalf.
background
Mrs S took out car insurance  through Saga who acted  as broker. Saga  also administered  the 
policy. The policy  was underwritten by another  business (the insurer).
Mrs Ss policy renewed on 19 January 2018 at a total cost of £124.87. That was made up of 
the car policy premium  of £94.87 and the motor legal expenses (MLE) insurance premium  of 
£30.00.
On 27 March 2018, Mrs S replaced  her car and asked Saga to amend her policy  to cover the 
new car. But as she wasnt happy with the cost of the amendment, on 29 March,  she 
cancelled her policy.
On cancellation  Saga said the following charges would  be deducted from the £124.87  she 
had paid before a refund was made:
£20.00 non-refundable renewal  arrangement  fee.
£50.00 mid-term  cancellation fee.
£30.00 non-refundable MLE premium.
£24.15 being the pro-rata cost of the car insurance cover  Mrs S benefitted from for 
70 days between 19 January and 29 March 2018.
The deductions above totalled £124.15.  By Sagas calculation the refund due to Mrs S 
should have been £0.72 (£124.87 paid  £124.15  deductions). But Saga  refunded  Mrs S 
£10.72.
Mrs S felt she had been charged too much  and that she was due a bigger refund. She 
complained. Saga didnt uphold her complaint saying the refund was correct  and they had 
told her about the charges when she took out the policy. But to resolve the complaint, as a 
gesture of goodwill, Saga made  a pro-rata  refund of the MLE premium. So, they paid Mrs S 
a further £24.25.
Mrs S still felt that was unfair so she brought her complaint to our service.  One of our 
adjudicators looked  into it. He felt that Saga had dealt with Mrs S fairly. As Mrs S didnt 
agree with our adjudicator, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
My provisional decision was issued on 1 May 2020.  I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im intending to 
uphold it. Ill explain why.
When Saga  sent Mrs S her renewal invitation  on 27 December  2017, they said the 
total cost of her renewal  was £144.87. That was made up of:
Ref: DRN90059232£94.87 premium for the car policy.
£30.00 premium for the MLE cover.
£20.00 policy renewal arrangement fee.
But when Mrs S accepted the renewal on 19 January 2018, Saga discounted the 
total cost to £124.87 by not charging  her the £20.00  renewal arrangement fee.
When Mrs S cancelled  her policy on 29 March 2018,  she had benefitted  from 70 days  
of insurance cover. So, I think the pro-rata  charge for those 70 days should have 
been £18.19 (£94.87  / 365 x 70 days).  But I think Sagas  calculation  of £24.15 was 
incorrect because they added the £30.00 MLE premium to the £94.87 car policy 
premium when calculating  that amount, which they shouldnt have as they are two 
separate premiums.  Although the combination of the two (£94.87  + £30.00 = 
£124.87) when calculated works out to a slightly lower pro-rata charge of £23.95  
(£124.87 / 365 x 70 days) than Saga  calculated.
It follows from the above that from the £94.87 premium Mrs S paid for her car policy, 
after deducting the charge  for the 70 days she was on cover, £76.68 remained in 
unused premium (£94.87  £18.19). And from that amount I think it was reasonable 
for Saga to deduct  the £50.00 cancellation fee. Thats  because  the admin charges, 
including the cancellation fee, were brought to Mrs Ss attention  in the policy renewal 
invites that Saga had sent her before she agreed to renew. So Mrs S bought the 
policy on the understanding  that she'd have to pay that fee if she cancelled her policy  
early. Saga also deducted the £20.00 renewal arrangement fee. But I dont think that 
was reasonable  because, as explained above,  they had decided not to charge that 
fee to Mrs S when she renewed her policy. So, I think the correct  car policy  premium  
refund due to Mrs S was £26.68 (£94.87  £18.19  £50.00).  But as Saga refunded 
her only £10.72 Mrs S is due a further  refund of £15.96 (£26.68  £10.72).
Although under the policy terms the MLE premium was non-refundable  and as such  
Saga were  entitled  to keep the £30.00  premium,  they decided  to make a pro-rata 
refund to her. That refund was £24.25 because the charge for the 70 days of cover 
was £5.75 (£30.00 / 365 x 70 days). And Saga  have  already correctly refunded that 
to Mrs S.
Mrs S said that when she told Saga she was going to change the car on her policy  
they told her there would only be a small fee for the amendment. She said she 
doesnt consider  £50.00 to be a small fee. But the £50 fee was the charge for 
cancelling her policy not for amending  the car on it. And her policy documents  clearly  
said she would be charged  an admin fee of £25.00 for any changes. I think that is a 
reasonable amount Saga  were entitled  to charge and they did bring it to Mrs Ss 
attention before she accepted the renewal. 
For the reasons  given  above, I intend to uphold this complaint.  I intend  to require 
Saga to refund Mrs S £15.96. Im aware  that bringing this complaint has been  a 
source of inconvenience for Mrs S and it has been ongoing for almost two years.  I 
think that could  have been  avoided  had Saga issued the correct  refund from the start.  
I therefore intend to require  Saga to pay Mrs S £50.00 compensation to address  the 
inconvenience she experienced.
Ref: DRN90059233The parties were invited to comment on my findings. Mrs S didnt comment.  Saga said they 
could have provided a more comprehensive  breakdown of the charges and refunds, so they 
agreed to pay £50 compensation. But they said they shouldnt  refund £15.96. Thats  
because they didnt waive the £20 arrangement  fee instead they applied a valued customer  
discount of £20.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, my decision remains  the 
same.
In response to Sagas comment about the £20 discount. Irrespective of whether that was a 
waiver of the arrangement fee or it was a customer discount, the bottom line is £20 was 
taken off the original  quote of £144.87. Once that happened the total cost to Mrs S went  
down to £124.87. And I understand  that amount was for the following:
£94.87 premium for the car policy.
£30.00 premium for the MLE cover.
So, the calculations  contained in my provisional decision where I identified a further refund of 
£15.96 being due still stands. And while Saga have given some figures in the comments  to 
my provisional decision, they havent  explained how they reached  those  figures or why the 
£15.96 refund isnt due.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I uphold this complaint and require Saga Services  Limited to:
Refund Mrs S £15.96.
Pay Mrs S £50 compensation for the inconvenience she experienced. This should be 
paid within 28 days of us telling them that Mrs S has accepted  my final decision. If 
they pay later than this they must also pay interest on that amount from the date of 
my final decision to the date of payment  at a rate of 8% a year simple.1
1 If Saga consider that they are required  by HM Revenue  & Customs to take off income tax from that 
interest, they should tell Mrs S how much they have taken off. They  should  also give her a certificate 
showing this if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HMRC if appropriate.  
Ref: DRN90059234Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs S to accept
or reject my decision before 19 June 2020.
