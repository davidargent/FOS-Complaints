The complaint
Ms P complains that NewDay Ltd terminated her credit card account whilst a payment break 
had been agreed. 
What happened
Ms P got in touch with NewDay in March 2020 to inform them that she was undergoing 
treatment for an illness, and asked for a payment break for her credit card repayments. 
NewDay agreed to this and a hold was placed on the account for three months.
Ms P is unhappy that NewDay continued to contact her and asked her to make a payment, 
even when the payment break was in place. When she received a default notice, Ms P 
spoke to NewDay about it, and was told to ignore it. NewDay then decided to terminate the 
credit agreement. So Ms P complained.
NewDay considered Ms Ps complaint and initially didnt uphold it. Since the complaint came 
to our service, NewDay has said it shouldnt have told Ms P to ignore the letter, and should 
have addressed this in the response to her complaint. It has offered £100 compensation in 
respect of this. 
But NewDay maintains that the decision to terminate the agreement was a commercial 
decision in line with the terms and conditions of the account. It says it will not be reinstating 
the account.
Our investigator considered the complaint and thought NewDays offer of compensation was 
fair. He said a default notice hadnt been applied on Ms Ps account, but NewDays actions 
led her to believe this had happened. So he thought she had been caused unnecessary 
distress. However he didnt think that if NewDay had been clearer about what could happen 
to the account, Ms P would have done anything differently - there would still have been three 
missed payments noted on her credit file and NewDay was right to record this information.
Ms P didnt agree that £100 was adequate compensation. And shed like the account 
reinstated. So the complaint was passed to me for a final decision.
I issued a provisional decision in December 2020, in which I said:
Under the terms and conditions for the account, NewDay can decide to close the account at 
any time on giving two months notice. And if a customer repeatedly fails to make payments 
on time, it can demand immediate repayment of the amount owed under the agreement. In 
view of the missed payments, NewDay was entitled to demand immediate repayment. But 
the relevant rules and guidance say lenders should give due consideration to the individuals 
circumstances. Put simply, they should treat their customer fairly. So Id expect NewDay to 
speak to Ms P to understand her circumstances and discuss what help might be appropriate.
Ms P was in touch with NewDay in March 2020, asking them to put a hold on the account 
due to her personal circumstances. This was put in place by NewDay and it wrote to her 
confirming this. In the letter it told Ms P she would still receive statements requesting 
overdue amounts but could ignore these.
Ms P called NewDay in April to query a letter shed received about the arrears on the 
account. The adviser told Ms P to ignore it. The adviser also confirmed there were no 
interest, charges or late fees being applied to the account whilst it was on hold until June. On 
this call Ms P was able to make a one-off payment towards the debt.
The letter Ms P was referring to was a default notice. This informed her that if she didnt pay 
a certain amount by the end of April 2020, the credit agreement would be terminated, and 
the credit card account closed. By telling Ms P to ignore this important document, I think 
NewDay led her to believe further action would not be taken.
Ms P didnt clear the outstanding amount and NewDay then decided to end the agreement. It 
sent a letter at the beginning of May to tell her this.
From what Ive seen, Ms P was under the impression she had a payment break on her 
account which would end in June 2020. Before it ended, she received a default notice and a 
termination of account letter. This all happened quickly. From Ms Ps point of view, things 
were on hold and she wouldnt have expected further action to be taken at that time; she had 
been told to ignore letters. If NewDay was planning to close her account so soon after 
agreeing to put things on hold, this could have been made clear to her. She was under the 
impression that no further action was needed from her, and the account would resume 
normally in June after the payment break.
I appreciate that NewDay can ultimately decide whether to continue providing credit. But it 
still needs to treat customers fairly. Where it makes a decision like this, I would expect it to 
explain clearly what may happen. In this case, the information given to Ms P was unclear 
and contradictory. If it had explained things more clearly, she may have been able to take 
different action.
The total amount to be paid off before the end of April was £336.69, and Ms P was able to 
pay £100 on that phone call. She wanted to keep her account if possible  shes explained 
that she spent several years building up her credit limit on the card and wanted it to have a 
positive impact on her credit rating. Ms P has said she would have tried anything she could 
to keep the account open  for example borrowing money from family to make a payment if 
necessary.
As I understand it, NewDay didnt mark the default on Ms Ps account for her credit file. It did 
record the late payments, but that was an accurate record of what had happened. So I dont 
think the credit record was wrongly affected. And I cant say whether Ms P would have been 
able to clear the arrears. But she was denied the chance to try and do that. And Im 
conscious that Ms Ps personal circumstances were difficult at the time  she was having 
treatment for a serious medical condition. She did the sensible thing of contacting NewDay 
to help manage the account and thought everything was on hold. The way this matter was 
handled would have added to her distress at a time that was already very difficult. So I agree 
some compensation is appropriate.
Having regard to the sequence of events, the situation Mis P was in at the time and the 
impact on her, I dont think £100 is sufficient. In my view, a payment of £250 would be fair. 
Replies to the provisional decision Both parties have confirmed they received the provisional decision. While unhappy that her 
account is closed, Ms P said she was happy to accept the compensation of £250. NewDay 
did not have any further comments to add.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms P has said shes happy to accept the proposed compensation and NewDay has not 
provided any further comments. On that basis, theres no reason for me to change my 
provisional decision and so it remains my view that NewDay should pay the sum of £250.
Putting things right
To put things right, NewDay needs to pay compensation of £250 to Ms P in respect of the 
distress and inconvenience caused to her.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to pay the 
compensation set out above to Ms P. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 February 2021.
