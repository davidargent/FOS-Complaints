The complaint
Mr W is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA permanently limited his account and
have also retained funds which belong to him and which he would like released.  
What happened
In July 2019 Mr W received notification from PayPal that his PayPal account had been
permanently limited. Mr W used PayPal as a payment service provider for his online
business and wasnt happy that PayPal had taken this action. He also felt that PayPal hadnt
provided a valid reason for why they had chosen to permanently limit his account. So, Mr W
made a complaint to PayPal and referred the matter to our service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They agreed that the level of information
PayPal had provided to Mr W as to why PayPal had chosen to permanently limit his account
wasnt as detailed or explanatory as this service would expect, but they ultimately agreed
with PayPals position that PayPal have a right to offer their services to whom they choose,
and that PayPal had acted within the bounds of the terms and conditions of the account. And
so, they didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr W wasnt happy with this response and so the case was escalated to an Ombudsman for
a final decision.  
My Provisional Decision
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on 20 January 2021 in which I said:
By the letter of the terms and conditions of the account, PayPal has acted within its 
rights here in choosing to permanently limit Mr Ws account.
I say this because of the following clauses contained within the terms and conditions:
We may close, suspend, or limit your access to your Account or our Services, and/or
limit access to your funds to the extent and for so long as reasonably needed to
protect against the risk of liability (see section 10.2h) if you violate this Agreement
including the PayPal Acceptable Use Policy, or any other agreement you enter into
with PayPal.
10.2 Actions by PayPal  a. We may, at any time and without liability, suspend,
block, limit, close or cancel your right to use your Payment Instrument or Account
entirely or for any particular transaction, which may in turn suspend, block, limit,
close or cancel access to your Account or the Services (such as limiting access you
any of your Funding Sources, and your ability to send money, make withdrawals, or
remove financial information). We will normally give you advance notice of any
suspension or cancellation but we may, if it is reasonable to do so (for example if you
are in breach of this Agreement or we consider it advisable for security reasons),
suspend or cancel your right to use your Payment Instrument or Account without
prior notice to you.
However, while I acknowledge that the clauses above do demonstrate that PayPal 
are entitled to permanently limit Mr Ws account without notice or explanation, it 
doesnt follow that strictly sticking to these terms and procedures will always lead to a 
fair outcome in individual circumstances.
So, while I do not dispute that PayPal have the right to cease doing business with
customers, I have considered whether the manner in which PayPal explained and 
executed this decision was fair to Mr W, given all the circumstances here.
I note that both Mr W and this service have asked PayPal for more detail about the 
reasons that caused PayPal to reach the decision to permanently limit Mr Ws 
account - but that PayPals responses to date have been quite reserved in their 
scope and didnt provide a full and compelling rationale as to the why their actions in 
this regard could be considered fair and reasonable.
It is, of course, PayPals choice to provide whatever level of explanation that they 
wish, but it is difficult for me to conclude that PayPal have acted fairly toward Mr W in 
how they have enforced their decision to permanently limit his account without a 
proper understanding of why they have decided to take this action.
Conversely, I can understand how the suddenness of PayPals decision and the lack 
of explanation from PayPal surrounding it would cause Mr W distress and 
inconvenience, especially given that this account was linked to his business which 
relied on PayPal as a payment service provider. For instance, the lack of a notice 
period from PayPal meant that Mr W was not given time to make alternative payment 
service provider arrangements for his business before the permanent limiting of his 
account came into effect.
And so, while I agree that PayPal are within their rights to choose to not do business 
with Mr W, I consider that the level of communication and lack of notice provided to 
Mr W by PayPal wasnt fair to Mr W in the individual circumstances here. Because of 
this, I think that PayPal should pay £250 to Mr W to compensate him for the distress 
and inconvenience he has suffered.
Finally, I note that the funds that Mr W held with PayPal have been returned to him 
by PayPal, and that this was done in line with the timeframe outlined in PayPals 
terms and conditions. So, I havent seen that PayPal have acted unfairly in any 
respect of the time taken or its other actions in returning Mr Ws money to him, so I 
havent included this in coming to my decision of what if fair compensation here.
My provisional decision
My provisional decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should pay Mr W 
£250 for the distress and inconvenience he has suffered.  
Developments
Both Mr W and PayPal responded to my provisional decision. Mr W accepted my provisional 
decision. PayPal noted that they continued to disagree with the reasoning of my provisional 
decision but confirmed that they did accept it.As both parties accepted my provisional decision, I have nothing further to add on the 
matter.  
My final decision
I uphold this complaint on the basis explained above and direct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCA to pay £250 to Mr W.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 March 2021.
