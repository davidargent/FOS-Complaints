The complaint
C complains WorldPay (UK) Limited (WorldPay) terminated his account with them without 
providing an explanation why.
What happened
C has held an account with WorldPay for a number of years, and following a review 
undertaken by WorldPay, C says they decided to terminate their relationship but refused to 
explain why. C says he provided WorldPay with an explanation why his turnover had 
changed during a restructure and this doesnt seem to have been taken into account. C says 
while he has now secured a new provider, the terms are less favourable, and this is a result 
of WorldPays actions. C says WorldPays actions has caused considerable stress, upset 
and has affected his business. C is demanding an explanation why the account was 
terminated and for WorldPay to compensate him for the trouble it has caused. 
WorldPay says they have taken a commercial decision to terminate the relationship and 
provided C with 60 days-notice to make alternative arrangements. They say this is in 
accordance with their terms and conditions and have done nothing wrong.
C was unhappy with WorldPays response and referred the matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator felt WorldPay had acted in accordance with their terms and conditions and didnt 
need to provide an explanation why the account was closed. 
C wasnt happy with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the same outcome as the investigator and I will explain how I 
have come to my decision. 
I do see it would be frustrating and upsetting for C to be told their long-standing relationship 
was to be terminated without a detailed explanation why this was. When looking at this 
complaint I have considered if WorldPay acted reasonably when giving notice to end the 
relationship with C and to then close the account. 
What happened here was WorldPay conducted a review of Cs account with them and in 
September 2019 asked C to provide further information so they could establish whether it 
met their risk appetite. This information was provided by C and despite this, WorldPay 
issued a letter later that month terminating their agreement and gave C two months-notice to 
close the account and make alternative arrangements. 
C says WorldPay refused to give an explanation why they took this action and feels they 
must. C also says that although he has now sourced a new provider, the terms are less 
favourable, and this is a result of the actions WorldPay took in terminating his agreement 
with them. C says he has suffered stress as a result of this and WorldPays actions have 
impacted on his business ability to trade in the same way it did before  C is asking for  
compensation from WorldPay as a result. 
I am satisfied it is reasonable for WorldPay to undertake periodic reviews of Cs account with 
them as part of their overall assessment of their risk appetite.
WorldPay says they have made a commercial decision to terminate the agreement with C 
referring to Section 12 of their agreement in which they are entitled to terminate the 
agreement provided they give two months-notice. I can understand Cs frustration and upset 
here and while he may not agree, WorldPay are able to make a commercial decision to 
terminate a relationship provided a reasonable notice period is given. In the same way C is 
able to end his agreement with WorldPay without an explanation.
Its not my role to tell WorldPay or any other provider who they must do business with, but to 
ensure they give consumers a reasonable notice period when doing so. I am satisfied this is 
what happened here as two months-notice was given to C. 
I have not seen any evidence to support Cs view, WorldPays actions have directly impacted 
on the terms and conditions of the account he has with his new provider. From the 
information presented to this service, I cant see there has been anything negative registered 
against C by WorldPay. 
While C will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking anymore of WorldPay here. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask C to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 March 2021.
