K820x#14complaint
Mr H has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has closed his 
accounts for racial discrimination reasons and requires them  to delete some of their records,  
apologise to him and compensate him.
background
NatWest wrote to Mr H to give him 60 days notice  that they were going  to close  his accounts 
with them.  They said the terms  and conditions of the accounts gave them the authority to do 
so.
NatWest then closed  Mr Hs accounts in accordance with the notice they had given him. 
Mr H has complained to NatWest that he feels his accounts should not have been closed 
without explanation and, he says, for racially motivated  reasons. He is asking them  for 
compensation.
NatWest said in their final response  letter to Mr H they had no evidence that the closure of 
the accounts was done  for racial  or discrimination reasons  but done according  to the terms 
and conditions of the accounts.  They offered  no compensation.
Mr H disagreed and complained to us.
An investigator looked into Mr Hs complaint  and found no evidence to support Mr Hs claim 
that his accounts  had been closed for discrimination reasons, or in a way that the terms and 
conditions of the account did not allow NatWest to do. Also, because the investigator felt that 
NatWest had nothing  wrong, she didnt ask them to pay compensation to Mr H.
The investigator gave  Mr H alternative  bodies that he might wish to contact to examine 
issues relating to the data that NatWest  hold for him, and the data that credit reference  
agencies might hold for him. The investigator also referred Mr H to the Equalities and 
Human Rights Commission for further  advice.
Mr H did not agree with the investigators  view and so his complaint has been passed to me 
for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Although I know Mr H has been  sent a document by the investigator that explains what  the 
ombudsman services role is, it is important for me to be mindful of the scope of my 
investigation into Mr Hs complaint and to restate it- I must weigh up the facts and I can then 
tell Mr H and NatWest  what I think.
Ref: DRN43959942The facts  are;
1)NatWest wrote to Mr H telling him his accounts  would be closed in 60 days time,
2)The terms and conditions of the accounts that Mr H has with NatWest  state in section 
12.2 that they can close  any account immediately and
3)60 days after NatWest wrote to Mr H, NatWest closed his accounts.
The Financial Ombudsman  Service cannot  make a finding of discrimination. Only the courts 
can do this. But we do think  about  what a court is likely to decide.
My investigation has focussed  solely on NatWests closure  of Mr Hs accounts.
The allegation that Mr H is making  about  NatWest closing his accounts  for racially motivated 
reasons is one that I have taken seriously. I have examined every  document that he and 
NatWest have presented  and I have found no evidence of any discrimination that supports  
Mr Hs claim.  But it is clear Mr H is upset  with his treatment.
Mr H said that NatWest  chose to close his accounts  after a transfer  of funds didnt  happen 
as intended. I cannot find any evidence that NatWest made the decision to close Mr Hs 
accounts for that reason.
Mr H has written extensively  to us about  how strongly he feels  and how the correspondence, 
written and verbal, he has had with NatWest over the closure  of his accounts has affected 
him. I can see that after more than 30 years as a customer, it is frustrating Mr H that 
NatWest even considered  closing his accounts.
NatWests letter giving  Mr H notice of the closing of his accounts says it is clear that the 
Bank/Customer relationship has irretrievably  broken down. 
And because NatWest chose to close Mr Hs accounts according to the terms and conditions  
that apply to his accounts, I cannot find that they have done anything unfairly or 
unreasonably. 
Mr H has expressed  very strongly  how he wishes NatWest to delete any of their records that 
he does not approve  of. This is not something this service  can make a direction on. I would  
suggest to Mr H that he contacts the body with authority  to oversee such matters-  the 
Information Commissioners Office.
Mr H has also asked that any records held by credit reference agencies  that he feels do not 
fairly show what has happened with his accounts, should be removed. As this is also 
something this service cant make a direction on without  any evidence  of a mistake, I would 
suggest to Mr H that he contacts the credit reference agencies directly that he feels holds 
that information and discusses with them what might be done, if anything.
I know Mr H will be disappointed with my findings, but I would refer him to the Equalities  and 
Human Rights Commission who are best placed  to offer him advice on matters  of the 
alleged discrimination.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Ref: DRN43959943Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 December  2019.
