The complaint
The estate of the late Mrs S complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading 
as Barclays Partner Finance, wont refund to it the money that Mrs S paid for some holiday 
club membership points rights. The late Mrs Ss husband is also involved in this complaint 
and the estate of the late Mrs S is being represented by a claims management company.
What happened
Mrs S and her husband had owned holiday club membership points since at least November 
2002. They entered into a purchase agreement in March 2010 to buy 2,000 holiday club 
membership points rights from a holiday company. The purchase price was £2,840 and I 
understand that Mrs Ss husband also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that amount  and that the loan was repaid in 
September 2010. 
Mrs S and her husband entered into another purchase agreement in April 2011 to buy 2,000 
more holiday club membership points rights from the holiday company. The purchase price 
was £3,340 and I understand that Mrs Ss husband also entered into a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan of that amount  and that the loan was 
repaid in August 2012.
Mrs S and her husband entered into another purchase agreement in June 2012 to buy 4,000 
more holiday club membership points rights from the holiday company. The purchase price 
was £3,500 and Mrs S entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance for a loan of £6,739. She agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £87.52 to 
Barclays Partner Finance. 
Mrs Ss representative made claims, on behalf of Mrs S and her husband, to Barclays 
Partner Finance under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in October 2016. It 
said that the holiday company: was in breach of contract; didnt conduct a proper 
assessment of their financial position and ability to repay the loans; applied considerable 
pressure to procure their agreement to the loans; and breached EU Law. A complaint was 
then made to this service. 
Mrs S and her husbands representative referred to claims under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act as well as the claims under section 140A. Their complaint form says 
that the holiday company and Barclays Partner Finance failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of their ability to afford the loans, Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission 
to the holiday company which wasnt declared to them and the holiday company unduly 
pressured them into entering into the purchase agreements and the loan agreements; all 
rendering the loan agreements unfair pursuant to section 140A. Barclays Partner Finance 
then provided a response to the claims that had been made to it in which it set out in detail 
the reasons that it didnt consider that the claims should be upheld. Mrs S sadly passed 
away in May 2018.
Mrs Ss husbands complaint about Barclays Partner Finances response to the claims that 
had been made to it relating to the loans that had been made to him in March 2010 and April 
2011 was then separated from Mrs Ss complaint about Barclays Partner Finances 
response to the claims that had been made to it relating to the loan that had been made to 
her in June 2012. The late Mrs Ss husbands complaint has been considered separately and 
a decision has been issued on that complaint by another ombudsman.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the estate of the late Mrs Ss complaint should be 
upheld as she didnt think that Barclays Partner Finances decision to turn down the claims 
was unfair or unreasonable. She wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the 
time of sale. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between 
Mrs S and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would 
reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She didnt consider that Barclays 
Partner Finance had acted incorrectly in connection with any commission paid to the holiday 
company and she also said that she hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the 
lending was unaffordable for Mrs S.
Mrs Ss representative says that it doesnt agree with our investigators recommendation and 
it has provided a generic submission from a legal counsel about the holiday company and 
the unfair terms that it uses. It has also set out the reasons that it considers that theres been 
a fundamental breach of contract by the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Ss complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
in this decision Im only considering the estate of the late Mrs Ss complaint about 
Barclays Partner Finances response to the claims that had been made to it relating 
to the loan that had been made to Mrs S in June 2012  the late Mrs Ss husbands 
complaint about Barclays Partner Finances response to the claims that had been 
made to it relating to the loan that had been made to him has been dealt with 
separately;
Mrs S and her husband signed a purchase agreement in June 2012 to buy 4,000 
more holiday club membership points rights from the holiday company and Mrs S 
signed a credit application and a customer compliance statement and she entered 
into the loan agreement;
the purchase agreement referred to the terms and conditions, a key information 
document and the holiday companys articles and associated legal documentation 
which were contained in a legal and governing documents booklet but none of those 
documents have been provided to me;
Mrs Ss representative sent an undated letter to Barclays Partner Finance which 
made claims under section 140A and the complaint form that was then sent to this 
service said that a complaint to Barclays Partner Finance had first been made in 
October 2016  the letter included claims that that the holiday company was in 
breach of contract, didnt conduct a proper assessment of Mrs Ss financial position 
and ability to repay the loan, applied considerable pressure to procure her agreement 
to the loan; and breached EU law;
a complaint was then made to this service which referred to claims under sections 75 
and 140A and the complaint form included complaints that the holiday company and 
Barclays Partner Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mrs Ss ability to 
afford the loan, Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mrs S and the holiday company unduly pressured Mrs S 
and her husband into entering into the purchase agreement and Mrs S into entering 
into the loan agreement;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Ss claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays 
Partner Finances response to her claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
the claim letter that was sent to Barclays Partner Finance said that the holiday 
company was in breach of contract and had breached EU law, but no further 
information about those breaches was provided in that letter; Mrs Ss representative 
then set out, in response to our investigators recommendation, the reasons that it 
considers that theres been a fundamental breach of contract by the holiday 
company, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres 
been a breach of contract or EU law by the holiday company for which Barclays 
Partner Finance would be liable under section 75;
that claim letter also says that Mrs S and her husband were told that they would get 
access to better accommodation that would rent out for a higher sum of money and 
that they were 100% guaranteed to rent out the points and cover all, if not more, of 
their yearly fees  and that they were told that their monthly finance amount would go 
down;
neither Mrs S nor her representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to Mrs S and her 
husband before their June 2012 purchase;
Mrs S and her husband had previously made purchases from the holiday company in 
March 2010 and April 2011 and they claim that misrepresentations were also made 
to them about those purchases  but if misrepresentations had been made to them 
about those purchases I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have 
been more cautious before making another purchase from the holiday company and 
to have ensured that any representations that were made to them were confirmed in 
writing;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
provided any guarantee to Mrs S and her husband that they would be able to rent out 
their points rights or that they would make a profit from them and I dont consider it to 
be likely that it would have given such guarantees to them;
Mrs S and her husband bought the points rights in June 2012 but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that they complained to the holiday company or Barclays Partner 
Finance about any misrepresentations before October 2016, more than four years 
later; 
Mrs S signed the customer compliance statement in which she confirmed that shed 
received the pre-contract credit information and the loan agreement and had had 
adequate time to consider the information that they contained  the loan agreement 
clearly showed that the monthly payment due from Mrs S would be £87.52 and Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs S and her husband were told that their monthly finance amount would go down or that it was reasonable 
for them to understand that their monthly payment would be less than it was before 
Mrs S entered into the loan agreement;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the points rights that 
Mrs S and her husband bought in June 2012 were misrepresented to them by the 
holiday company or that they were induced into entering into the purchase 
agreement by any such misrepresentations;
the claim letter included a claim that the holiday company didnt conduct a proper 
assessment of Mrs Ss financial position and ability to repay the loan and the 
complaint form includes a complaint that the holiday company and Barclays Partner 
Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mrs Ss ability to afford the loan;
Mrs S completed a credit application before the loan was made to her in which she 
confirmed that she was a retired home-owner with annual pension income of £15,500 
 Barclays Partner Finance says that it adheres to strict lending criteria and Mrs Ss 
application was approved based on its lending criteria in place at the time;
it also says that Mrs Ss monthly outgoings were £378.40, leaving a net monthly 
balance of £912.60, so a monthly loan payment of £87.52 was assessed as 
affordable and payments were maintained until Mrs S passed away;
Mrs S also signed the customer compliance statement in which she confirmed: l/we 
are confident that from an income perspective that the repayments will be met now 
and in the future;
the loan was made to Mrs S in June 2012 but Ive seen no evidence to show that she 
asked Barclays Partner Finance for any information about the affordability 
assessment that it conducted before October 2016 and I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect her to have raised any concerns about the affordability 
assessment before then;
I consider that it was reasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to conclude on the 
basis of the information that Mrs S had provided that she could afford a loan with a 
monthly repayment of £87.52 and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that the loan wasnt affordable for her, that Barclays Partner Finance should 
have done more to assess the affordability of the loan for her, that the loan was mis-
sold to her or that Barclays Partner Finance has acted incorrectly in connection with 
the loan;
the complaint form includes a complaint that Barclays Partner Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mrs S - but Ive not 
been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by 
Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 15% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to 
Mrs S risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mrs S entered into the loan agreement in June 2012 and I consider it to be likely that 
any commission would have been paid at about that time, but Ive seen no evidence 
to show that she contacted Barclays Partner Finance about any commission that it 
had paid to the holiday company before October 2016;the claim letter included a claim that the holiday company applied considerable 
pressure to procure Mrs Ss agreement to the loan and the complaint form includes a 
complaint that the holiday company unduly pressured Mrs S and her husband into 
entering into the purchase agreement and Mrs S into entering into the loan 
agreement - but Mrs S and her husband had the right to withdraw from the purchase 
agreement within 14 days without giving any reason and Ive seen no evidence to 
show that they contacted the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance to 
withdraw from the purchase agreement within the applicable withdrawal period;
it was clear from the loan agreement that Mrs S also had the right to withdraw from 
the loan agreement but Ive seen no evidence to show that she contacted Barclays 
Partner Finance to withdraw from the loan agreement within the applicable 
withdrawal period;
Mrs S and her husband signed the purchase agreement in June 2012 but Ive seen 
no evidence to show that they complained to either the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the undue pressure that Mrs S claims was applied to them 
before October 2016  if they had been unduly pressured into signing the purchase 
agreement and didnt want to buy the additional points rights, I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect them to have contacted either the holiday company or 
Barclays Partner Finance about that issue sooner that they did;
Mrs S and her husband had entered into purchase agreements with the holiday 
company in March 2010 and April 2011 and they claim that they were unduly 
pressured into entering into those agreements  but if theyd been unduly pressured 
by the holiday company into entering into those agreements I dont consider it to be 
likely that theyd have them entered into another purchase agreement to buy 4,000 
more points rights from the holiday company in June 2012;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs S and her husband 
were unduly pressured into entering into the purchase agreement or that Mrs S was 
unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mrs Ss representative has provided a generic submission from a legal counsel about 
the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses  but it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in the agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mrs S and her husband 
and I consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances 
that the terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mrs S and 
Barclays Partner Finance;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the late Mrs Ss 
relationship with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be 
likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between her 
and Barclays Partner Finance in these circumstances;
I sympathise with the late Mrs Ss husband and the estate for the loss of Mrs S and 
for the issues that have been experienced with the points rights that were bought in 
June 2012, but I consider that Barclays Partner Finances response to the claims that 
had been made to it was fair and reasonable; andI find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclays Partner Finance to refund to the estate any of the money thats been paid 
under the loan agreement, to pay it any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to this complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold the estate of the late Mrs Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask a representative of 
the estate of the late Mrs S to accept or reject my decision before 11 December 2023.
