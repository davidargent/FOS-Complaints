K821x#15complaint
Miss C says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading  as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly 
lent to her. She says she had to borrow  further  to repay debt and consequently  had to take 
on a repayment  plan.

Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Cs complaint  and thought  the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. 
Sunny disagreed and initially offered to uphold Miss Cs complaint from loan nine onwards. 
Miss C didnt accept this offer. Sunny later reviewed the complaint  and offered  to uphold the 
complaint from loan six, but again, Miss C rejected it. 
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me to decide in my role as 
ombudsman.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss C could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
Ref: DRN49635692consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss C could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Miss C didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to three shouldnt  be 
upheld. Because  of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
And Sunny has already offered to pay redress for loans six to loan 13. So, I wont  be making 
a decision about  this lending with the exception of how Sunny should put the matter right. 
But the loans  were part of the borrowing relationship  Miss C had with Sunny. So, it is 
something I will take into account when considering the other  loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Cs complaint in relation to loans four and five.
As our adjudicator explained, she had reviewed  Miss Cs financial circumstances for when 
loan four was taken.  This is information that Sunny has given us so it should have been  
aware.
When loan four was taken  in November 2016, loan three was still running and wasnt  repaid 
until January 2017. This meant that when Miss C took loan four, she would need to service  
loan three  at the same time. At the time loan four was taken Miss C told Sunny that her 
monthly income was £1,871 and her outgoings  were £1,587  (its unclear what  loan 
repayments this figure  may have included).  On top of this expenditure Miss C was paying 
Ref: DRN49635693£200 a month for loan three which would be increased by another £115 per month   so £315 
 when loan four was taken.
After taking account of her monthly outgoings  Miss C had told Sunny about, Miss C had a 
disposable income of £284. So, its quite clear she simply could not afford to make the 
monthly repayment due on loans three and four - £315. 
In its response to the adjudicator  who had referred to the above income and expenditure 
figures  Sunny has said Miss C actually had £387 disposable income and therefore  had 
enough disposable income  to make the contractual repayments for loans three  and four. But 
even using Sunnys  figure, this would have  only left Miss C with £72 per month for non-
essential expenditure. I think  this sum left Miss C without sufficient margin  for any additional 
non-essential that can arise from day to day living. So, I maintain the loans were 
unaffordable for Miss Cs then current financial  circumstances and shouldnt have been 
given to her.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans four and five and Sunny  should put things  
right.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Cs case, I think  this point was reached by loan 
six, which Sunny itself has identified. It has told us that Miss C missed payments on loan five 
and so should have asked  her additional  questions regarding her financial circumstance. 
So, I think that Miss C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Cs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss C borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Cs ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN49635694putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do  Ive included loans six to 13 for 
completeness
If any outstanding  balance due on Miss Cs loans  (loans ten, 12 and 13) has been 
transferred to a third party,  Sunny  should buy the loans back if it can. If Sunny cant  buy the 
loans back then it needs to work with the third party to make  sure the following is achieved: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Miss C towards interest,  fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by Miss C which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss C originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges  from the balance on any upheld  outstanding 
loans, and treat any repayments made  by Miss C as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. 
If this results  in Miss C having made  overpayments then Sunny should refund  these  
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen,  to the date the complaint is settled. 
Sunny should  then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step 
E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus, then the surplus  should  be paid to Miss C. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan 
with Miss C. 
E) Remove any adverse information  recorded on Miss Cs credit  file in relation to four 
and five.
The number of loans  taken from loan six onwards means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans six to 13 should  be removed from 
Miss Cs credit file. Sunny does not have to remove loans ten, 12 and 13 from 
Miss Cs credit file until these have been repaid, but any adverse information  
recorded about these loans should  still be removed.
   HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must 
give Miss C a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN49635695my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Cs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 13 April 2020.
