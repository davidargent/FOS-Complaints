K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that a car he acquired,  under a hire purchase (HP) agreement with 
Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited  (VWFS), was of unsatisfactory quality. And 
that contrary to what he was advised  by VWFS, adverse information in respect of his HP 
agreement has been recorded with one or more credit reference agencies.
Mr C is represented in his complaint  by his daughter. However,  for ease I will refer to any 
submissions made by Mr Cs daughter as if they had been made by Mr C.
background
The cash  price of Mr Cs new car was £28,940.
Mr C part exchanged an existing  car, for the new car, and received  £7,325  trade in. He also 
received a dealer deposit contribution towards the new car of £3,800. This took Mr Cs gross 
deposit for the new car to £11,125. From this gross deposit of £11,125 Mr Cs finance on his 
traded in car of £9,227.50  was settled leaving him with a net deposit of £1,897.50. This net 
deposit was paid to the dealer  requiring  Mr C to finance a balance  (for the acquisition of the 
new car) of £27,042.50.
Mr C financed the balance of £27,042.50 in April 2017 under an HP agreement with VWFS 
where he was required,  everything else being equal, to make 48 monthly payments of 
£425.67 followed by 1 monthly  payment, in month  49, of £11,457 (inclusive of £10 option  to 
purchase fee). This made a total sum repayable (excluding Mr Cs net deposit of £1,897.50) 
of £31,889.16.
Mr C complained to VWFS that the car he had acquired wasnt  of satisfactory  quality and 
that it should:
collect the car from him at no cost
cancel his HP agreement with him having  nothing further to pay under it
refund  all payments  he had made  under the HP agreement up to and including  the 
date of collection of the car
remove all record of the HP agreement from his credit  file
Mr Cs complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators who came to the view that it 
should be upheld.  In summary he said he was satisfied  that Mr C had acquired a car that 
wasnt of satisfactory quality and that he should be able to reject it. And in addition, VWFS 
should:
collect the car from Mr C at no cost to him
cancel Mr Cs HP agreement with him having nothing further to pay under it
refund  Mr C his deposit  together with 8% simple interest
record Mr Cs HP agreement  as settled on his credit file
pay Mr C £250 for the distress and inconvenience he had been  caused
The adjudicator then went on to advise Mr C that VWFS should  remove  the HP agreement  
entirely from his credit  file, rather than just marking it as settled.
Mr C responded to say he accepted the adjudicators view.
Ref: DRN89619682VWFS responded to say that it agreed  that Mr C should be able to reject the car and that it 
should pay him £250 for the distress and inconvenience he had been caused.  But before it 
would allow rejection, and before it recorded Cs HP agreement as settled on his credit  file, 
Mr C needed to pay it £15,113.60 made up as follows:
£6,385.05  in missed  payments - 15 payments  of £425.67
£4,500 - 10,000 miles travelled at 45p a mile
£6,582.75  - 26,331 miles travelled at 25p a mile
(£4,256.70) payments  made  10 payments of £425.67
£1,902.50  negative equity carried over from Mr Cs traded in car - £9,227.50  less 
£7,325
The adjudicator considered VWFS  response to his view and said that he disagreed that it 
should be able to charge  Mr C £6,826.05  for excess miles travelled (£4,500  + £6,582.75  - 
£4,256.70). In his view a fairer charge for excess miles  travelled would be £1,439.92.
VWFS agreed to seeking from Mr C a reduced a mileage charge of £1,439.92 and so the 
adjudicator issued a second view in which he concluded  that VWFS should:
collect the car from Mr C at no cost to him
cancel Mr Cs HP agreement, on Mr C paying VWFS £9,727.47 broken down as 
follows:
o£6,385.05  in missed  payments (15 payments of £425.67)
o£1,439.92  for excess miles travelled
o£1,902.50  negative equity carried over from Mr Cs traded in car
record Mr Cs HP agreement  as settled on his credit file, on Mr C paying VWFS 
£9,727.47
pay Mr C £250 for the distress and inconvenience he had been  caused
VWFS responded to say that it accepted  the adjudicators view.
Mr C responded to say that he disagreed with the adjudicators view. In summary he said:
some  of the excess miles travelled were in respect of him returning the car, on more 
than one occasion, to one or more garages for inspection  and repair
some  of the excess miles travelled were in respect of miles travelled by one or more  
garages whilst the car was in for inspection and repair
he shouldnt have  to pay the negative equity  sum of £1,902.50 because  this has no 
bearing on his complaint
the negative  equity sum of £1,902.50 has been  paid by virtue of the monthly 
payments he has made  under his HP agreement since  April 2017
he was advised  by VWFS, on more than one occasion, that no adverse information 
would be recorded with credit reference  agencies whilst his complaint was under 
consideration
he was advised  by VWFS, on at least one occasion, that it would accept rejection of 
the car and that it would pay him £11,409.90 in compensation.
VWFS then advised the adjudicator that another monthly HP agreement  payment hadnt 
been made by Mr C and that there  was a strong chance the car had travelled further miles, 
meaning that what Mr C should  fairly have to pay it had, in all probability, increased.
Ref: DRN89619683VWFS then advised the adjudicator that it was prepared to reduce:
the excess mileage charge for trips made  to and from one or more garages and for 
miles run up by one or more garages on evidence being provided of the same
the negative  equity by £342.45 to reflect 9 payments made  against  this sum by Mr C
Mr C confirmed to the adjudicator that in his view the excess mileage charge should be 
reduced by £360  (based on 5,000  miles at 7.2p a mile).
Mr C then confirmed to the adjudicator that the car had been written off in an accident  and 
the insurance pay-out of £13,900 (£14,500  less £600 excess)  in this respect had been paid 
to VWFS.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in December 2020. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   
Its clear Mr C has very strong feelings  about this complaint. He has provided detailed  
submissions in support  of his view which I can confirm  Ive read and considered  in their 
entirety. However, I trust that Mr C will not take the fact that my findings focus on what  I 
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as 
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every  point  raised. The purpose 
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them.
VWFS accepts  that Mr C acquired  a car that wasnt of satisfactory quality. And based on 
what Mr C has said and submitted, and the various  documents and job sheets that Ive seen, 
Im in agreement.
So, what  I now need to decide, given that everybody  accepts that Mr C acquired a car that 
wasnt of satisfactory quality, is what VWFS should have to do to fairly compensate Mr C.
Now VWFS has provided our service with a settlement figure for Mr Cs HP agreement  
dated February 2020  of £13,559.08 made up as follows:
gross  sum outstanding*1 £17,842.05
rebate (£1,024.72)
net sum outstanding £16,817.33
overpayments*2 (£3,258.25)
sum due £13,559.08
*1total repayable  under  the HP agreement £31,889.16
scheduled payments  (33 x £425.67) (£14,047.11)
gross  sum outstanding £17,842.05
Ref: DRN89619684*2scheduled payments  (33 x £425.67) £14,047.11
payments made (5 x £425.67) (£2,128.35)
payment made (1 x £1,277.01) (£1,277.01)
payment  made (1 x £13,900.00) (£13,900.00)
overpayments £3,258.25
And VWFS suggests that it should  be able to seek recovery  of this sum from Mr C.
Now in my view it would be unfair for Mr C to be able to walk away without having to pay 
anything further  to VWFS, particularly given that the car has been  written off. But equally I 
dont think its fair or reasonable that VWFS should  be able to seek  recovery from Mr C the 
full sum of £13,559.08.
Mr C says he was without  the car for approximately 150 days. Now Ive been  unable to 
reconcile this with the number of days VWFS says Mr C was without the car. But taking 
everything into account, including that its my understanding  that Mr C was provided with a 
courtesy car for most, if not all, of the days he was without the car, I think that VWFS should 
reduce the settlement sum of £13,559.08 by one payment of £425.67  to reflect  this.
The payment Mr C received from his insurance company reflects  the market  value of the car 
at the time of the accident taking into account  (amongst other things) miles travelled. 
Therefore, I dont think any adjustment for miles travelled in excess of 8,000 miles a year 
needs to be made in favour of VWFS. However, I think that some  adjustment  for miles 
travelled by Mr C, in taking and collecting  the car from one or more  garages,  and for test 
miles that might have been travelled,  should  be made.
Mr C says an adjustment for 5,000  miles should  be made. However, and having  considered  
what both parties have said and submitted, I think an adjustment for 2,000 miles should  be 
made. Therefore,  in my view VWFS should reduce the settlement sum of £13,559.08 by £80.
For the avoidance of doubt this is based on what the trade  guides  say the effect  of an 
additional 2,000 miles would have had on the value of Mr Cs car rather  than using the 
arbitrary sum of 7.2p a mile.
The adjudicator suggested that VWFS should  pay Mr C £250 for the distress and 
inconvenience he has been caused. Now I dont disagree that Mr C should  be compensated 
for the distress and inconvenience he has been  caused. But in my view the fairest  remedy  in 
this respect is for VWFS to reduce the sum of £13,559.08  by £250 rather  than pay the same 
directly to Mr C.
Ive also considered whether it would be appropriate to adjust the settlement figure of 
£13,559.08 for any other reason, for example (but not restricted to) negative  equity being 
carried over and for the dealer deposit contribution that was paid. But taking everything into 
account Im satisfied that its entirely  appropriate that no further adjustment to the settlement 
figure be made.
Ref: DRN89619685So, in summary  I think that VWFS  is entitled  to seek recovery from Mr C the sum of 
£12,803.41, being:
the February 2020 settlement figure  £13,559.08
adjustment for loss of use (£425.67)
adjustment for 2,000  miles travelled (£80.00)
adjustment for distress and inconvenience (£250.00)
adjusted settlement figure £12,803.41
I will now turn to Mr Cs submission that he was advised by VWFS, on more  than one 
occasion, that it wouldnt record any adverse information with credit reference agencies  in 
respect of his HP agreement whilst his complaint was being considered by it. And that, on at 
least one occasion,  VWFS agreed  to collect the car from him and pay him, by way of 
compensation, £11,409.90.
In support of the above submission Mr C has provided several letters  which he says were 
sent to him by VWFS.
Now I cant say for certain how Mr C came to be in possession of these letters. But I can 
confirm that Im satisfied  that they werent sent by VWFS. Ive come  to this conclusion given 
that VWFS has no record of such letters being sent and given the manner and style in which  
they are written.
And because of my view in this respect and given  that Ive seen no other persuasive 
evidence in support  of what  Mr C says on this point, I find that VWFS never  advised Mr C 
that it wouldnt record any adverse information with credit reference agencies  in respect of 
his HP agreement whilst his complaint was being considered by it. Or that it agreed to collect 
the car from Mr C and pay him, by way of compensation, £11,409.90. 
VWFS responded to my provisional decision to say that it had nothing further to add, but it 
would like confirmation that it need  not remove any past adverse information recorded with 
credit reference agencies.
Mr C didnt respond to my provisional decision by the date I gave.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that Mr C didnt  respond to my provisional  decision  and given that VWFS confirmed it 
had nothing further to add, I see no reason to depart  from my provisional findings and I now 
confirm them  as final.
However, for the sake  of clarity, I would add that VWFS does not need to remove  any 
adverse information  recorded with credit reference  agencies in the past if this information is 
an accurate reflection of the conduct of the account  and the payments made by Mr C.
Ref: DRN89619686my final decision
My final decision is that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited can:
seek recovery from Mr C the sum of £12,803.41, but ensuring it treats him positively 
and sympathetically  if, when doing  so, it transpires he is in financial difficulties
and must:
ensure Mr Cs credit file accurately reflects the payments he has made against his 
HP agreement to date, and makes against  it going  forward
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 February  2021.
