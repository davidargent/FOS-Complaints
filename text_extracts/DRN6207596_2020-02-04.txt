K821x#15complaint
Mr R complains NewDay Ltd kept on calling him after hed asked  to be contacted in writing  
only. He had mental health issues  at the time, and this made his anxiety worse.
background
Mr R has a credit card issued by NewDay.
Mr R wrote to NewDay and his other  creditors to say that he was in financial difficulties and 
had contacted a debt management company. Mr R says he asked NewDay and his other 
creditors to contact him in writing  only as he had mental health issues,  and telephone calls 
were making his anxiety  worse. Mr R says NewDay continued to phone  him despite his 
request. So he complained.
NewDay investigated Mr Rs complaint, but didnt  uphold it. NewDay  said that it had 
contacted Mr R by telephone  because  it hadnt  received a response to its letters.  NewDay  
offered to refund three £12 over limit fees it had applied to Mr Rs account  as a gesture of 
goodwill. Mr R wasnt happy with NewDays response so complained to us.
One of our investigators  looked into Mr Rs complaint. NewDay  told our investigator that it 
didnt take Mr Rs letter  that he looked  forward to hearing back  from them via letter  to 
mean that he only wanted to be contacted in writing. Our investigator disagreed. More 
importantly, our investigator thought that the number of calls NewDay had made was 
disproportionate to the amount Mr R owed. They also thought that Mr R had been caused a 
considerable amount of distress and recommended  NewDay pay him £500  in compensation. 
Mr R accepted our investigators recommendations and asked if the compensation could be 
paid directly to him. NewDay  didnt  accept our investigators recommendations. It said that it 
had already stopped calls when Mr R wrote  to them at the end of February 2019 to say he 
was having issues  with his mental  health. It said that it only called Mr R again when he didnt 
reply to its letters. So Ive been asked to consider  this complaint.
Ref: DRN62075962my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done this, Im upholding this 
complaint and I give my reasons below-
1.what went wrong
NewDay says it didnt  take Mr Rs letter saying he looked forward to hearing  from it via 
letter as meaning that he didnt want to hear from them by telephone. Having read that 
letter, I dont think this was an unreasonable conclusion on NewDays part. Mr R didnt say 
he looked forward to hearing from NewDay only via letter  or please dont call me. His 
letter was more ambiguous than that.
Having received Mr Rs letter, NewDay put a hold on calls until the end of February. NewDay 
resumed its calls when it didnt hear back from Mr R after writing  to him saying lets talk. 
Again I dont think this was unreasonable.
Im satisfied that when  the calls resumed, NewDay was probably unaware of the effect  the 
calls would  have on Mr Rs mental health. NewDay explained that the calls were made by an 
automated teller, and as Mr R didnt  answer  any of the calls, the teller would call at different 
times of the day to try to make contact. It was only when Mr R raised a formal complaint 
explicitly asking that contact be in writing only, that the calls stopped.
NewDay was right to stop calling  Mr R when he complained  its clear  the calls were  having 
a very negative impact  on his mental health. I do, however, think  that NewDay  could have 
reacted much faster to stop the calls.  It took NewDay  two days to put a hold on calls.
NewDays subsequent  response to Mr Rs complaint wasnt  what  I would have expected.  I 
say this because  Mr R was very clear  when he complained that he didnt want  to be 
contacted by telephone.  In other words, there wasnt  the same  ambiguity as there was in his 
earlier letter.  He said that the constant  calls are making me distraught  and please I am 
begging you stop phoning me amongst other things. 
NewDay recognised  in its response  that the calls were upsetting  Mr R because it said 
youre unhappy that you keep getting  calls. But NewDay then went on to say ..If we 
cant make  contact by phone  and if you would like to get in touch please call. In other  
words, NewDay  was still suggesting speaking to Mr R on the phone despite him making  it 
clear the impact calls were having on him. In its final response letter NewDay also provided 
a customer care number urging Mr R to call them saying as I believe that they may be able 
to help.  
When NewDay received  the emails  from Mr R and read them, it really needed to pay 
attention to Mr Rs situation and recognise the impact of the calls on Mr Rs mental health 
condition. NewDays response suggests  it didnt recognise the impact  its calls were having, 
or that it didnt care. That wasnt what Mr R needed.  He needed  a positive and sympathetic 
response from NewDay. I think NewDay  completely missed the point that Mr R was making,  
namely that he was unable  to deal with matters  on the telephone.
  
My view is that NewDays correspondence should have referred  to a way in which  he could 
deal with it in writing.
Ref: DRN620759632.Impact and Compensation
Mr R has described the calls he received from NewDay  as mental  torture  and has said that 
NewDay was wrecking  his mental  health.  Hes also said that NewDay bombarded him with 
calls for months. I appreciate that this might be how it felt to Mr R, but I can see that NewDay 
only called  once in January and once in February.  So I dont think  its right to say that 
NewDay bombarded Mr R with calls for months.
NewDay called Mr R ten times over three days at the beginning of April, after which  it didnt 
call him again  although it did suggest  calling as mentioned  above.  I dont think it would be 
fair to tell NewDay to pay compensation  for the impact  all of those calls had, given that Ive 
already said NewDay  wasnt  aware  the impact its calls were having until Mr R complained. 
But I do think Mr R could, and should, have been  saved from the distress some  of those 
calls caused as I do think NewDay  should  have acted sooner. And the distress NewDays  
subsequent suggestions that they speak on the phone should have been avoided  too. In 
short, I think Mr R suffered  a degree  of unnecessary  distress. I agree with our investigator 
that £500 is fair compensation for the unnecessary distress he experienced.  So thats the 
award Im going to make. 
 
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  and NewDay  Ltd should  pay the sum of £500 to Mr R for the impact  
on him of the calls it shouldnt have made.  
The payment should  be made directly to Mr R.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 March 2020
