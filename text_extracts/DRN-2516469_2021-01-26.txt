DRN-2516469
The complaint
D, a limited company, complains that SumUp Payments Limited restricted Ds account and 
required D to open a second account. D also complains that SumUp was slow to reply to an 
email and was generally obstructive.
What happened
D is represented in this complaint by its director, Mr C. Mr C was originally a sole trader, and 
he had an account with SumUp. When he incorporated his business as D, he informed 
SumUp so that his account could be updated accordingly. But unexpectedly, SumUp asked 
him for more information about his business, and then when this was provided, told him that 
he would have to open a second account. SumUp said this was because under its terms and 
conditions, a customer could only use an account for one business activity, and SumUp was 
of the opinion that Mr C was carrying out two business activities. (I wont say what the 
activities are here in case it compromises Mr Cs anonymity.) SumUp required him to get two 
accounts, one for each activity. Meanwhile, the existing account could not continue to be 
used until Mr C had verified the nature of the activity his business was engaged in.
Mr C denied that the terms and conditions said what SumUp claimed they said. He insisted 
that there was no limit on how many different activities his business could conduct, as long 
as they were not prohibited activities as defined in the terms and conditions. He complained 
that SumUp was being unnecessarily bureaucratic and obstructive, and that it had taken too 
long to answer his concerns. He also argued that he was being discriminated against, 
because he was aware of other businesses which did not have to get multiple accounts. 
SumUp did not agree, saying its policy was based on compliance and anti-money laundering 
considerations. So Mr C brought this complaint to our Service, on behalf of D.
Our investigator did not uphold this complaint. After considering what the terms and 
conditions said, he concluded that SumUp had been entitled to require Mr C to get a second 
account. He found no evidence that Mr C was being singled out or discriminated against. He 
thought SumUp had replied to Mr Cs emails within a reasonable amount of time.
Mr C asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The terms and conditions have already been quoted to Mr C by SumUp and by our 
investigator, so I wont repeat them again here.1 I think that the clause SumUp relies on 
(3.4(ii)) could perhaps have been worded more clearly, but I think SumUps emails to Mr C 
explained clearly what it meant and what he had to do, and so I dont think lack of clarity was 
the root of the problem. Rather, the real issue in this case is whether Ds business

contravened the relevant term or not. I think the answer to that is to be found in a later 
clause in paragraph 3.4, which reads as follows:
We shall at our sole discretion decide whether your use of the Services shall be 
deemed attributable to any of the above products or services and therefore not in 
accordance with the Terms.
So as long as SumUp reached its decision in good faith, then it was entitled to overrule Mr C 
and to insist that he open a second account for what it judged to be the second branch of his 
business. I think SumUps assessment was within the range of reasonable opinion, and 
I have seen nothing which suggests to me that Mr C was treated unfairly or by a different 
standard to SumUps other customers. It follows that I must conclude that SumUp was 
entitled to require Mr C to open a second account.
The use of the existing account was only restricted briefly until the information provided by 
Mr C had been assessed, and I think that was reasonable.
After an exchange of ten emails over a period of five days, there was then a gap of four days 
until SumUp replied to Mr Cs last email, and then after his next email there was a gap of 
nine days until SumUp replied to that one. That is not ideal, and I can see why Mr C 
complained about that. But I dont think those delays are serious enough to warrant an 
award of compensation. By then, SumUp had already made its position clear, and had given 
Mr C clear instructions about what he needed to do. The only information that had not yet 
been provided to Mr C was the paragraph number of the term on which SumUp relied, 3.4, 
which was finally given in the last email to which I have referred. I dont think that was the 
cause of any lost income or lost business which D may have incurred. I appreciate that it 
may have been frustrating to Mr C, but as his company is the complainant in this case, not 
him as an individual, I cannot award compensation to D for Mr Cs injured feelings.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C, on behalf of 
D, to accept or reject my decision before 24 February 2021.
