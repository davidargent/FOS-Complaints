Ms V complains  that Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) didnt do enough checks 
before approving loans that were  unaffordable to her.

Ms V says better checks would have shown  she was becoming dependent  on short-term  
credit and had loans with other short-term providers. She adds that her pattern of borrowing 
with Lending Stream itself should  have indicated she was a poor candidate  for credit.
Lending Stream says it asked Ms V about her income and expenditure before approving  the 
loans and that the repayments were affordable based on her declared disposable income.  It 
says it also checked  Ms Vs credit file and was satisfied with her credit score. Lending  
Stream added that for the last three loans it also compared Ms Vs expenses  with national  
averages and revised the figures  upwards. But it says it still found  the loans were affordable.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He considered  Ms Vs 
lending was unsustainable from loan 5 onwards and recommended  interest and charges 
(plus 8% statutory interest) should  be refunded. He also recommended that negative 
information about loan 5 should be removed from Ms Vs credit  file and that loans 6 to 10 
should be removed  entirely.
Lending Stream did not respond so the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN15714392Lending Stream needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure 
Ms V could repay the loans in a sustainable manner.  These  checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably  
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether  Ms V could sustainably repay  her loans   not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Vs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, proportionate checks for loan 5 would most likely have shown:
oMs V was having  problems managing her money
by the time she applied for loan 5 shed incurred two late fees on 
previous loans
she already had three outstanding Lending Stream  loans
oMs V would have  been unable to sustainably  repay this loan, as well as the 
previous outstanding loans.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Lending Streams  lending history with Ms V, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream  should  reasonably  have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so Lending Stream  should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Ref: DRN15714393Given the circumstances of Ms Vs case, I think this point was reached  by loan 6 because:
From  loan 6 onwards  Ms V was provided with a new loan within  weeks of applying  
for a previous  one. So Lending Stream ought  to have realised it was more  likely than 
not Ms V was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  previous loans was 
leaving in her finances and that Ms Vs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably;
Ms V had at least three other Lending Stream loans outstanding  when  she applied 
for each of loans  6 to 10;
Ms V wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Lending Stream.  Loan 
10 was taken out 14 months  after Ms Vs first. And her debt had increased, meaning 
her repayments were double what they were initially. Ms V had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Lending Stream over an extended period.
I think Ms V lost out because Lending Stream continued to lend to her after loan 4 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Vs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Ms Vs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint for loans  5 to 10 and Lending Stream should put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending Stream) 
should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Ms V paid on loans 5 to 10;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on refunds from payment date to settlement date*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  on loans 6 to 10, apply the refund to 
reduce any capital outstanding and pay any balance to Ms V; 
Arrange to repay any portion  of the sum due to the third parties that is made  up of 
interest and charges   including any added by the third parties;
Pay Ms V interest and charges shes already  paid to the third party plus 8% interest  
simple per annum  on each amount from the payment date to the settlement date;
Remove any negative  information about loan 5 from Ms Vs credit  file.
The number of loans  taken from 6 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 10 should be removed from Ms Vs 
credit file once theyve been repaid;
Request the third parties to remove any information they may have recorded about 
loans 6 and 9 once theyve been  repaid.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending 
Stream must give Ms V a certificate  showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one. 
If Lending Stream intends to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance, it 
must do so after deducting  the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms V to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 October  2019.
