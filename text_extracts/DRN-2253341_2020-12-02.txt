The complaint
Mrs I is unhappy PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA didnt cover the cost of damage to wheels 
which were returned to her from a buyer. Mrs I has said PayPal told her it would cover the 
damage under its seller protection scheme. But after the buyer raised a chargeback, PayPal 
said Mrs I wasnt covered under the seller protection scheme as per its terms and conditions. 
What happened
Our investigator felt the complaint should be upheld. She said PayPal hadnt dealt with the 
chargeback fairly and that it may have provided Mrs I hope of assistance from its seller 
protection scheme when speaking to Mrs I on the phone. She felt PayPal should cover the 
cost of the damage to the wheels plus interest. It should also offer £150 for the trouble and 
upset it had caused. 
PayPal didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint. It said it cant 
manually review items and defend a chargeback which is raised as significantly not as 
described. And it has no control over the outcome of the chargeback as that process is 
decided by the buyers card issuers regulations. It added that it has already refunded some 
of the fees associated with the chargeback and the fee for the payment.  
I reviewed the complaint and felt that PayPal had provided a poor service to Mrs I. But I 
didnt think Mrs I had been treated unfairly after the chargeback was raised. And I was 
satisfied that the item being raised as significantly not as described meant Mrs I wasnt 
covered under PayPals seller protection scheme. I asked PayPal to offer Mrs I £200 in 
compensation for the way it had handled the complaint which it agreed to. 
Mrs I didnt think that was a fair offer. She said if PayPal had told her she would be covered 
under its seller protection scheme then she should be covered for the damage. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im going to uphold the complaint in part. I know Mrs I feels strongly about 
this complaint and this will come as a disappointment to her, so Ill explain why.
Ive read and considered the whole file. But Ill concentrate my comments on what I think is 
relevant. If I dont mention any specific point, its not because Ive failed to take it on board 
and think about it, but because I dont think I need to comment on it to reach what I think is 
the right outcome.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, or contradictory (as it is here), I must make 
my decision on the balance of probabilities  that is, what I consider is more likely than not to 
have happened in the light of the available evidence and the wider surrounding 
circumstances. 
This service would expect PayPal to resolve a dispute between two of its customers fairly. I 
can see it sent an e-mail asking for information from Mrs I about the chargeback. And 
PayPal has said it passed the information about the decision it made (for the buyer to return 
the wheels to Mrs I for a full refund) on its internal dispute to its bank so this could be 
considered and then decided by the buyers card issuer. The card issuer then decided that 
as the buyer had returned the goods they were entitled to a refund. This decision by the card 
issuer mirrored the decision that was made by PayPal in February 2019. So, Im satisfied 
PayPals handling of the chargeback wasnt unfair. 
I can understand Mrs I is frustrated with PayPal for not providing call recordings to this 
service. But it isnt the role of this service to enforce the data protection laws. Thats for the 
Information Commissioners Office. However, Im satisfied its more likely than not PayPal 
did say by mistake, on at least one of the calls, she would be covered for the damage. But I 
dont think that means it should cover the cost of the damage here. 
The reason PayPal has rules in place is so that its customers are treated fairly and 
consistently. Having seen the rules, these say a seller (Mrs I) isnt covered under the seller 
protection scheme when a dispute about an item sold is raised as significantly not as 
described. The buyer raised the item as significantly not as described in February 2019 but 
then decided to raise a chargeback despite PayPal asking them to return the wheels. So, I 
understand why PayPals communication was a cause of frustration, but I dont think its 
enough to ask it to cover the full cost of the damage. Thats because it asked the buyer to 
return the wheels. And if this had been done when PayPal requested it in March 2019, a 
chargeback wouldnt have been necessary and Mrs I wouldve been covered. 
So, I believe its right that PayPal pay Mrs I some compensation to recognise the poor 
communication here.
Putting things right
Ive considered that PayPal has already refunded the £14 chargeback fee and the £21.25 
fee for the payment. Which I think is fair. And the £200 PayPal has now offered seems 
reasonable to me and in line with what Id expect in similar cases. 
My final decision
My final decision is that this complaint should be upheld in part. 
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must pay Mrs I £200. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs I to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 December 2020.
