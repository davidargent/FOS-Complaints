The complaint
Mr L complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) didnt refund him for a return.
What happened
In July 2020, Mr L bought an item for £77.93 and paid by PayPal. He filed a claim with 
PayPal that the item wasnt as described. He returned the goods to the seller in August 
2020. PayPal declined his refund request.
Mr L complained. He said hed complied with what PayPal requested  he shipped the item 
back to the seller in August 2020 and provided evidence of this to PayPal. He then gave 
them evidence of delivery. Hed complained to PayPal but had heard nothing from them after 
eight weeks.
PayPal said they declined the refund because Mr L hadnt provided proof of delivery of the 
item. They offered to refund the amount as a gesture of goodwill.
Mr L brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator said that PayPals Buyer 
Protection say9 a buyer must give them proof of delivery to the sellers address. Hed seen 
the evidence that Mr L had done that  so PayPal shouldve decided the dispute in his 
favour, not the sellers. So, theyd made an error. As a result, he said Mr Ls complaint 
should be upheld and PayPal should pay compensation of £50 in addition to the refund of 
£77.93.
PayPal disagreed. They said Mr L hadnt provided the information within the timescales 
requested. They asked that the complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 PayPals Buyer Protection says that buyers can get a refund under certain circumstances. It 
says that under its Buyer Protection, buyers must Respond to PayPal's request for 
documentation and other information within the time requested 
-Step 3: Respond to PayPal's requests for documentation or other 
information, after you, the seller or PayPal escalates your dispute to a claim for 
reimbursement. PayPal may require you to provide receipts, third party 
evaluations, police reports or other documents that PayPal specifies. You must 
respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our 
correspondence with you.
-Step 4: Comply with PayPal's shipping requests in a timely manner, if you're 
filing a Significantly Not as Described claim. PayPal may require you, at your 
expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to PayPal or to a third party (which 
will be specified by PayPal) and to provide proof of delivery.
-Step 5: PayPal will make a final decision (including automatically closing any 
dispute or claim), in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility 
requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the 
online dispute resolution process or any other information PayPal deems relevant 
and appropriate under the circumstances.
In this case, I can see that Mr L shipped the item to the seller  and to the address 
provided by PayPal - on 18 August 2020. PayPal asked him for this information, and he 
uploaded this to its Resolution Centre on or around 25 September 2020. Mr L also 
showed us evidence that the item was delivered  on 12 October 2020. On that day he 
called and emailed PayPal to show this. Mr L couldnt access any information from the 
Resolution Centre as his case was closed.
PayPal told us two different stories  firstly, that the shipping information wasnt 
provided. And then, later, the Mr L hadnt provided the information in time. I can see that 
PayPal asked Mr L to upload the shipping information by 20 August 2020  and I cant 
see that he did this. But in any event, PayPal asked him again for this on 25 September 
2020  when he did send it. So, he did comply within the timescales that PayPal set out. 
And he did provide the shipping and delivery information needed. So, PayPal shouldve 
refunded Mr L in line with its Buyer Protection  rather than making a goodwill payment.  
And, Mr L had to email and call PayPal in order to sort things out  so I agree with our 
investigator that a compensation sum should be paid.
Putting things right
PayPal must pay Mr L £77.93 in respect of the refund request, plus £50 compensation for 
distress and inconvenience.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint.
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must pay to Mr L £77.93  the refund for the purchase - plus 
£50 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2021.
