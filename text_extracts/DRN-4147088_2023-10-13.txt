The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as B, is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest) converted its Bounce Back Loan (BBL) to a standard business loan.
Bs complaint is bought to this service by its director, whom Ill refer to as Mr A.
What happened
In September 2020, Mr A successfully applied for a BBL on Bs behalf, and B received the 
loan funds shortly thereafter. 
In December 2020, NatWest became aware that B had only been incorporated on 25 March 
2020 and so didnt appear to meet the eligibility criteria for the BBL scheme, which included 
that an applicant business had to have been trading before 1 March 2020. NatWest wrote to 
Mr A about this and asked for proof of Bs BBL scheme eligibility. But Mr A didnt respond to 
NatWests requests. Because of this, NatWest concluded that B hadnt been eligible to 
receive a BBL and they converted Bs BBL to a standard business loan. Mr A wasnt happy 
about this, so he raised a complaint on Bs behalf.
NatWest responded to Bs complaint but didnt feel theyd done anything wrong by 
converting the BBL to a standard business loan as they had. Mr A wasnt satisfied with 
NatWests response, so he referred Bs complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel NatWest had acted 
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation and so didnt uphold the complaint. Mr A 
remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I note that Mr A has provided several detailed submissions to this service regarding Bs 
complaint. Id like to thank Mr A for these submissions, and I hope he doesnt consider it a 
discourtesy that I wont be responding in similar detail here. Instead, Ive focussed on what I 
consider to be the key aspects of this complaint, in line with this services role as an informal 
dispute resolution service. 
 
This means that if Mr A notes that I havent addressed a specific point hes raised, it 
shouldnt be taken from this that I havent considered that point  I can confirm that Ive read 
and considered all the submissions provided by both B and NatWest. Rather, it should be 
taken that I have considered that point but that I dont feel it necessary to address it directly 
in this letter to arrive at what I consider to be a fair resolution to this complaint.
Id also like to confirm that this service isnt a regulatory body or a Court of Law and doesnt 
operate as such. Instead, this service is an informal, impartial dispute resolution service. And 
while we do take relevant law and regulation into account when arriving at our decisions, our 
remit is focussed on determining whether we feel a fair or unfair outcome has occurred  
from an impartial perspective, after taking all the factors and circumstances of a complaint 
into consideration.
In this instance, I feel that because it appears that B was only incorporated after the 1 March 
2020 trading eligibility deadline for the BBL scheme, its reasonable that NatWest would 
consider B to not be eligible to have received a BBL. And because Mr A didnt respond to 
NatWests requests for him to provide proof of Bs BBL scheme eligibility, I feel that it was a 
fair outcome here that NatWest converted Bs BBL to a standard business loan.
Mr A has explained to this service that he feels that NatWest havent followed a correct 
process following the conversion of the BBL to standard business loan. However, as per the 
rules by which this service must abide  which can be found in the Dispute Resolution 
(DISP) section of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Handbook  this service can only 
consider a complaint after the business being complained about has had the opportunity to 
consider that complaint themselves and to have responded to it.
Mr A doesnt appear to have raised this further aspect of Bs complaint with NatWest. And I 
note that NatWests complaint response doesnt address it. Instead, of the complaint points 
that Mr A referred to this service on Bs behalf, the only point that NatWest appear to have 
presently had the opportunity to respond to is Bs complaint that the BBL was converted to a 
standard business loan. As such, If Mr A would like to pursue the further aspect of Bs 
complaint about NatWests actions after the BBL was converted to a standard business loan, 
he would need to refer this aspect of Bs complaint to NatWest directly  so that NatWest 
has the opportunity to consider that complaint and to respond to it.
Regarding the aspect of this complaint that I can consider  the NatWest converted Bs BBL 
to a standard business loan  I reiterate that I feel that this is a fair outcome. This is because 
it appears that B wasnt eligible to receive the BBL loan it applied for and because Mr A 
hasnt proven Bs eligibility for the BBL scheme in response to NatWests reasonable 
requests for him to do so.
All of which means that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take 
any further action here. I trust that Mr A will understand, given what Ive explained, why Ive 
made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask B to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 November 2023.
