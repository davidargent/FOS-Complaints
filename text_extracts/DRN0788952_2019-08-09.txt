Mr and Mrs J complain National Westminster Bank Plc has unfairly rejected proposals 
theyve made to pay back their interest only mortgage.
background
In 1989 Mr and Mrs J took out several loans with National Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest) 
over a term of 25 years. They took out several additional loans later on. All of the loans were 
combined into one mortgage with sub-accounts which came to an end at different  times. 
But all the terms had ended by around  April 2015.  Some parts of the mortgage were on a 
capital repayment  and interest basis  initially. But all of the borrowing is now on an interest 
only basis. Mr and Mrs J currently  owe around  £385,000.
Mr and Mrs J put forward  several proposals  to NatWest from around the end of 2014  
onwards to pay off their borrowing.  None of these proposals has been accepted  by NatWest. 
Because of this Mr and Mrs J think NatWest  have treated them unfairly.
Mr and Mrs J brought  their complaint to this service in April 2018. Our investigator thought 
NatWest had treated  Mr and Mrs J fairly in all the circumstances and didnt uphold their 
complaint. Since Mr and Mrs J didnt accept  our investigators view Ive reviewed everything 
afresh to come  to a final decision. For reasons Ill explain I agree with our investigators view.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Mr and Mrs J have made a number of 
complaints about  their mortgage, some of which have been dealt with in decisions by other 
ombudsmen at this service. To be clear, this decision only relates to their complaint NatWest 
has unfairly rejected  their proposals to pay back  their borrowing.
Mr and Mrs J are worried about  losing whats been their family home since  around 1966. 
This is entirely understandable. But its important  to note the terms and conditions of 
Mr and Mrs Js mortgage made clear it was their responsibility to make sure they could 
repay the mortgage at the end of the term. And I need to bear this in mind when thinking 
about whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of Mr and Mrs Js complaint.
Mr and Mrs J have quite rightly  pointed out that under Financial Conduct Authority guidelines 
NatWest should  give fair and reasonable consideration to any request Mr and Mrs J make  
for help,  such as extending  the term of their mortgage, converting  to a repayment  mortgage 
or letting  them make  overpayments.  It should only consider  repossession  as a last resort.  Id 
expect Mr and Mrs J to cooperate with NatWest  to discuss their options and provide 
information to NatWest so it can consider those options fully. 
Mr and Mrs J have put a number of proposals  to NatWest since 2014. And although its 
instructed solicitors to take possession proceedings, NatWest has held off taking possession 
of the property while its considered those proposals. 
Mr and Mrs J told NatWest in January 2014  theyd be in difficulties in repaying their 
mortgage and wanted NatWest to agree to them paying off the mortgage  for less than they 
owed. Investments which NatWest had thought  Mr and Mrs J would have to pay off the 
mortgage werent available when the term ended. Amongst  other  things, Mr and Mrs J said 
Ref: DRN07889522they had limited income and owed large amounts  of money to other  people.  And they 
thought there was negative equity in the property. Mr and Mrs J offered to pay £190,000, 
funded by others, to pay off the mortgage in full  they owed around £387,000 at this time. 
I can see NatWest carried  out a thorough investigation into Mr and Mrs Js circumstances to 
see what options might be available for them.  And they were in contact with Mr and Mrs J 
during that time to discuss  things with them.
NatWest wasnt prepared  to write  off a substantial part of the mortgage as Mr and Mrs J 
were proposing. I wouldnt usually expect a lender to agree to that. And Mr and Mrs J were 
obliged to repay their mortgage in full as Ive said.
Mr and Mrs J thought  there was negative  equity in the property because  the time remaining  
on their lease was short.  An informal valuation NatWest  got from a reputable  estate agent 
suggested there was value  in the property.  Based  on that I think it was reasonable for 
NatWest to think there would probably be enough  money to pay off the mortgage without 
there being a shortfall if the property  had to be sold. So I think it was fair and reasonable for 
NatWest not to accept  the offer to pay less than they owed to pay off the mortgage  in full.
In line with its lending  policy, NatWest was prepared in 2014, and has been  prepared since, 
to consider extending the term of Mr and Mrs Js mortgage until the eldest of them is 80 
years old. I need to think about whether  its fair and reasonable  for NatWest to apply their 
policy strictly  in Mr and Mrs Js case.  
Generally its reasonable for a lender to take into account the additional risks that might arise 
when lending into older age - for example a reduction in income if one of the borrowers were 
to pass away making  the payments unaffordable for the survivor or something that might  
affect the value  of the property  if it agreed to extend the term of a loan. This is because the 
lender could be put to additional  costs if it had to repossess and sell the property and/or if 
there was a shortfall it couldnt get back. I think both these risks applied here given Mr and 
Mrs Js limited income and the short term left on their lease. 
Mr and Mrs J were around  70 and 63 years of age respectively in 2014. I can see in 2014  
NatWest thought about extending the term of the mortgage and converting it to a repayment 
mortgage so Mr and Mrs J could  repay  what they owed.  It was reasonable for NatWest to 
consider if this would  be affordable for them. Mr and Mrs J had provided information  about 
their financial  situation as Ive mentioned already. From the information NatWest had I think  
it was reasonable  for NatWest to think  Mr and Mrs J wouldnt be able to pay back  the 
mortgage even  if it agreed  to a reasonable extension of the term.
NatWest told Mr and Mrs J in around  May 2015 it would take action to recover  what they 
owed as it hadnt been possible to come to an arrangement for the borrowing to be repaid. I 
think NatWest explained  clearly enough to Mr and Mrs J what theyd done and what  would 
happen, and treated  them fairly and reasonably in doing so.
In fact, NatWest delayed seeking possession  of the property while it and this service 
considered other complaints Mr and Mrs J made about their mortgage.
In April 2017 Mr and Mrs J offered to pay £85,000  with the balance payable  on a capital and 
interest repayment basis over seven  years.  
Ref: DRN07889523During 2017 NatWests  forbearance, financial assistance and customer  care teams were all 
involved in considering Mr and Mrs Js situation.  Im satisfied the bank was actively  
considering how it could help at this time.  
There was no reason to think  Mr and Mrs Js financial  situation had improved since  NatWest 
had looked at things in 2014. Mr and Mrs J were getting help from others  to make monthly 
payments. There was no clear information about  where the lump sum payment Mr and Mrs J 
were planning  to make was coming from. And I wouldnt expect NatWest to have taken into 
account payments  that might be made by someone that isnt party to the mortgage in 
assessing what they could afford to pay each month to clear the balance. So I think  it was 
reasonable for NatWest to have concerns.
In the autumn of 2017 Mr and Mrs J withdrew  their offer saying  the monthly payments theyd 
need to make wouldnt be affordable and would leave no money for essentials. So 
NatWests concerns were  justified.
In March 2018 Mr and Mrs J made  a new offer to pay a lump sum of £125,000  with the 
balance of around £260,000 to be paid over six or seven years  in monthly instalments. But 
when they brought their complaint to this service in April 2018 Mr and Mrs J wanted  NatWest 
to consider again an offer of an £85,000  lump sum payment with the balance  paid over 
seven years. In August  2018 they changed  the offer to a lump sum of £100,000 and the 
balance over seven  years.   
In April 2018 and May 2018 Mr and Mrs J told NatWest the lease on their property  had been  
valued at £650,000 and they were no longer in negative equity. And they said theyd been 
marketing the property. But Mr and Mrs J were reluctant to sell and asked NatWest to 
consider again  their proposals to repay. Mr and Mrs J offered again a lump sum payment of 
£85,000 with the balance  over seven years. Referring to an earlier  conversation with 
NatWest in 2017, they said monthly payments of £4,300 would be too much  for them.
 
Some confusion arose about what offers Mr and Mrs J were making. NatWest and their legal 
advisers thought  Mr and Mrs J were offering to pay £250,000 and then a lower amount of 
£100,000 in full payment of the mortgage.  I dont  think  either  party is to blame more than the 
other for this misunderstanding. Some of Mr and Mrs Js letters  were unclear  but with careful  
reading I think NatWest couldve understood their intention.
In August  2018  NatWest instructed lawyers to recover the loan through possession  
proceedings if necessary. Even  though  Mr and Mrs J had brought  their complaint to this 
service by that time,  I dont think it was unreasonable for NatWest to do this. It was over four 
years since  the mortgage term had ended.  And, as NatWest understood things, there  was 
no proposal from Mr and Mrs J on the table to repay the whole of the mortgage. Proceedings 
were put on hold when the offer was explained. And NatWest has considered later proposals  
that have been made.  
Mr and Mrs Js legal  adviser clarified  things in September 2018 and made a clear  proposal 
then as follows:
A lump sum payment  of £100,000
The balance of around £285,000 over seven years
Interest fixed at 1.95% 
Monthly repayments of around  £3,635
Ref: DRN07889524For reasons Ive explained, I think it was reasonable for NatWest  to consider any request for 
a term extension in line with their policy not to lend beyond age 80. Since Mr J was 75 by 
2018, this meant NatWest  would only think about lending for another  five years.
 
Again it was reasonable for NatWest to consider whether Mr and Mrs J could afford  to repay  
the mortgage in full over an extended  term. Mr and Mrs J argued  NatWest was using 
unreasonably high interest  rates  to work  out whether Mr and Mrs J would be able to pay 
since the proposal they were making  was for interest to be fixed  for the extended term. I 
agree, although  I think NatWest was probably  prepared to consider a fixed  interest rate. And 
Id expect it to have offered a product from its available range at the time if it had been 
satisfied it was in Mr and Mrs Js best interests to extend the term.
But I dont think Mr and Mrs J have shown they can afford to make either the lump sum 
payment theyve proposed or the monthly repayments theyd have to make to clear  the 
balance on a repayment basis over what would now be four years  until Mr J is 80 years  old. 
I acknowledge Mr and Mrs J have made some overpayments  since  January 2019 which 
have reduced their mortgage  by a small amount. Theyve provided some  limited evidence  
the lump sum they propose making would come  from a family trust. And I can see Mrs J has 
a small private and state pension. While Mr Js accounts suggest his income  over the last 
three financial years has been up to around £50,000, theres  no information about where the 
increased income is coming  from or if it is likely to continue. And I havent seen any clear  
explanation of how Mr and Mrs Js financial circumstances have changed since  2014.  Given 
the difficulties  they were  having I think NatWest could reasonably  ask for more detailed  
information to work  out whats affordable for Mr and Mrs J.
However, looking at Mr and Mrs Js September  2018 proposal, even if no interest  was 
charged on the balance of £285,000,  monthly payments over four years would be would be 
around £5,938.  The most  recent  information  suggests Mr and Mrs J have a combined gross  
monthly income of around £5,400.  
Bearing everything in mind, I dont think Mr and Mrs J have shown,  at any stage, they could 
afford what they were  proposing. So I dont think its unreasonable NatWest  hasnt accepted  
Mr and Mrs Js offers. But I do think NatWest has reasonably considered  the proposals Mr 
and Mrs J have made.
NatWest has been  consistent in what its said. So Id expect Mr and Mrs J to have looked at 
other ways  of raising the money  to pay off their mortgage while they were discussing things 
with NatWest. Im satisfied Mr and Mrs J marketed their property during 2018. And theyve 
said they had some interested potential buyers at £650,000 for the remainder of the lease. 
They said they couldnt go ahead with selling until theyd resolved things with NatWest. But I 
think NatWest wouldve been willing  to consider letting Mr and Mrs J sell at this price as it 
wouldve recovered its borrowing without incurring  the additional costs and delay of taking 
possession proceedings. And I think it was Mr and Mrs Js reluctance to sell rather  than 
NatWests willingness to discuss  a sale that led Mr and Mrs J to put the buyers off. 
I think Mr and Mrs J wouldve realised by 2017, when they withdrew their offer to NatWest 
because it wasnt affordable for them, it was likely  theyd have to sell their house.  And 
although I appreciate this wouldve been a wrench for them, I think  it was, and still is, in their 
best interests for this to happen. Mr and Mrs J seem to have been in financial  difficulties  for 
a long time and I think Mr and Mrs Js financial situation is still uncertain. Even  though it 
looks as if theres a potential source of income Mr J hasnt told anyone  about until recently, I 
Ref: DRN07889525dont think its affordable now for them to pay whats needed to pay off the borrowing in four 
years. And extending the term of the mortgage and paying additional interest will make 
things more expensive  in the long run.
In summary  I think NatWest has treated Mr and Mrs J fairly and reasonably. Its considered  
all of the proposals Mr and Mrs J have put to it. Its worked with the incomplete  information 
Mr and Mrs J have provided  to assess their options.  Its come to the reasonable conclusion  
Mr and Mrs J cant afford  to repay  their mortgage over a term extended  in accordance  with 
NatWests policy. Bearing everything  in mind  I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Js complaint.
NatWest have told us they are now able, as a change to their processes  when  mortgage  
terms come  to an end, to offer to refer customers to another part of their business  who offer 
lifetime mortgages. If Mr and Mrs J want to follow up on that I suggest they contact NatWest 
as soon as possible. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Js complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs J to 
accept or reject my decision  before  9 September 2019.
