The complaint
Mr L complains that Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited mishandled his claim on a motor 
insurance policy. 
What happened
The subject matter of the claim and the complaint is a hatchback car, first registered in late 
2003.
Mr L had the car insured on a comprehensive policy with Admiral for the year from 7 July 
2022. Any claim for damage (except to windscreen glass) was subject to an excess of 
£400.00.
Unfortunately, in late July 2022, someone damaged the car. Admiral said the car was a total 
loss and its pre-loss value had been £1,440.00.
Mr L complained to Admiral that it was under-valuing his car. By a final response dated mid-
September 2022, Admiral said it had increased its pre-accident valuation to £2,040.00 and 
would pay the difference of £600.00 plus a small amount of interest, and £25.00 
compensation. 
Admiral said it had based its valuation on the average of the following guide figures:
Glasss £1,755.00
CAP £2,325.00  
Mr L brought his complaint to us without delay.
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. He said that Autotrader 
couldnt provide a valuation in Mr Ls case, due to the age of the car. Hed obtained a further  
trade guide valuation as follows:
Cazoo £4,414.00
He recommended that Admiral should:
1.  use an average of the three valuations; and
2. pay Mr L the difference between this and what it had already paid him. 
Mr L agreed with the investigators opinion, but not with the lower valuation of £1,755.00.
Admiral disagreed with the investigators opinion. It asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. It says, in summary, that:
The Glasses and CAP values of £1,755.00 & £2,325.00 are aligned.
Cazoos valuation at £4,414.00 should be disregarded as it is over £2,000.00 out of 
line with the other valuations.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We expect a motor insurer to assess market value of a used vehicle by reference to retail 
figures in certain trade guides. We usually find those guides persuasive because they are 
based on extensive research of likely selling prices.
We usually find advertisements less persuasive because they contain asking prices that may 
be subject to negotiation downwards.
Ive noted that the car passed an MOT test in early October 2021 with a recorded mileage of 
about 113,000. Mr L had owned the car since at least early November 2021 (the date of its 
most recent V5). Mr L renewed his policy with Admiral from early July 2022.
Ive noted the make, model, age, condition and recorded mileage of the car. For a vehicle 
like that in July 2022, the investigator found the three valuations mentioned above.
One unsatisfactory feature of the final response is the inclusion of the following sentence:
We are now providing a valuation settlement figure at the average of these 2 figures, 
£2492 and I am unable to agree any further increase in your valuation in accordance 
with the terms of your policy.
That is unsatisfactory because it does not relate to the two valuations (Glasses and CAP) 
that Admiral said it was relying on  or to the average of £2,040.00.
Compared to the Glasses valuation, the CAP valuation is £570.00 higher. Thats an increase 
of about 30%. So I dont consider that those two valuations are well aligned.
Compared to those two valuations, the Cazoo valuation is at least £2,000.00 higher. Thats a 
large increase. So Ive thought about disregarding the Cazoo valuation as an outlier. 
And yet, the advertisements provide support for the Cazoo valuation. And the other two 
valuations arent well aligned. So I dont find it fair to disregard the Cazoo valuation in favour 
of the other two.
The range of valuations is so great that I dont find it fair and reasonable to say that any 
valuation in the range would be fair.
Overall, I dont find that Admirals valuation of £2,040.00 treated Mr L fairly. 
Putting things right
I find it fair and reasonable to direct Admiral to increase its valuation to the average of the 
three valuations, that is £2,831.00. That will require Admiral to pay Mr L (in addition to its 
previous payments of £1,040.00 and £600.00) a further £791.00.
As Mr L has been out of pocket in that amount since the date of his claim, I find it fair and 
reasonable to direct Admiral to add interest at our usual rate. My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I direct 
Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited to:
1. increase its valuation to the average of the three valuations, that is £2,831.00; and
2. pay Mr L (in addition to its earlier payments of £1,040.00 and £600.00) a further 
£791.00; and
3. pay Mr L simple interest on the further £791.00 at a yearly rate of 8% from the date of 
his claim to the date of payment. If Admiral considers that its required by HM 
Revenue & Customs to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr L how 
much its taken off. It should also give him a certificate showing this if he asks for 
one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2023.
