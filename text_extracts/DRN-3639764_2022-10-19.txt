The complaint
Mr W complains that a car that he paid for using a fixed sum loan agreement with Santander 
Consumer (UK) plc, trading as Santander Consumer Finance, wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
Mr W bought a new electric car which had a cash price of £32,221. He made an advance 
payment of £5,000 and entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Santander Consumer 
Finance that he electronically signed in September 2021 for a loan to pay the balance of the 
price. The loan was interest free and he agreed to repay the loan by a payment of £343.12, 
47 monthly payments of £343.04 and a final payment of £10,755.
He had issues with the cars battery not fully charging and with the range of the car so he 
returned the car to the supplier for it to deal with those issues. The issues continued so Mr W 
complained to Santander Consumer Finance. It arranged for the car to be inspected by an 
independent expert in February 2022. It then sent its final response letter and the report to 
Mr W but he wasnt able to open them. The final response letter said that the issues that 
Mr W had been experiencing were not seen as a fault with the car and that the dealer had 
offered to equalize or rebalance the battery and explained how Mr W could also do that. 
Mr W then complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He wasnt 
persuaded there was a fault with the car so he didnt think that Mr W had been supplied with 
a car that was of unsatisfactory quality and he didnt think that it would be fair or reasonable 
to ask Santander Consumer Finance to allow him to reject the car.
Mr W has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in 
summary, that the independent experts report confirms the fault and that the statement from 
the manufacturer shouldnt be relied on.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr W used credit in the form of the loan agreement from Santander Consumer 
Finance to pay for the car and, in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of 
goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ws complaint about Santander Consumer Finance, I must 
be satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplied of the car and that Santander Consumer Finances response to his claim 
under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of 
Mrs Ms claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
the breach of contract about which Mr W is complaining is that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to him - whether or not it was of satisfactory 
quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage 
of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr W was a new car and I consider that it was 
reasonable for him to expect that it would be free from even minor defects;
Mr W had issues with the cars battery not fully charging and with the range of the car 
so he returned the car to the supplier for it to deal with those issues  but the issues 
continued so he complained to Santander Consumer Finance;
Santander Consumer Finance arranged for the car to be inspected by an 
independent expert in February 2022 and the experts report said:  at no point 
could we achieve a maximum range displayed on the dashboard when the battery 
was showing [100%] charge, the maximum range being 182 miles. The manufactures 
stipulate that it should charge to a range of 250 miles;
it concluded that:  the suggested range of 250 miles cannot be achieved based on 
the charging, despite a 150kw charger being used and as such the matter should be 
referred back to the manufacturers for their consideration - but it also considered the 
range of electric cars and says: The underlying fact is that one vehicle may achieve 
better range than its counterpart and this should be maintained in all operating 
situations if both vehicles were tested at the exact same time and on the exact same 
route. The need to maintain strict comparability of results achieved across various 
manufacturers necessitates a standard test, which is strictly controlled they cannot 
be fully representative of real-life driving conditions for the following and is only an 
indication of an achievable value in what might be considered optimal conditions; 
Santander Consumer Finance sent the experts report to the supplier of the car for its 
consideration as recommended by the independent expert  but the supplier said 
that there was no manufacturing fault or defect with the cars battery and that the 
battery range can be impacted by several factors such as driving style and other 
features being engaged;
the independent expert didnt say that there was a fault with the car or that it wasnt 
of satisfactory quality and it didnt recommend that Mr W should be able to reject the 
car  and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require 
Santander Consumer Finance to allow Mr W to reject the car;
the quoted range of a car is based on standard testing in a controlled environment 
and is the maximum range that would be achieved  and in ordinary use I dont 
consider it to be reasonable to expect the maximum range to be achieved;
I sympathise with Mr W for the issues that hes had with the car and the frustration 
that he clearly feels about the range of the car but Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that theres a fault with the car  so I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable for me to require Santander Consumer Finance to refund to him 
any of the money that hes paid under the loan agreement, to end the loan 
agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
his complaint; and
Mr W has also complained that he couldnt open the final response letter and experts 
report that Santander Consumer Finance sent to him  I can understand the 
frustration that that caused Mr W but its a decision for it to make as to how it 
communicates with its customers and this service wouldnt normally interfere with a businesss legitimate commercial decisions and Im not persuaded that it would be 
appropriate in these circumstances for me to interfere with Santander Consumer 
Finances decision to send those documents to Mr W in the way that it did.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2022.
