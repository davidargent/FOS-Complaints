Miss T complains Elevate Credit International Limited (trading  as Sunny) lent to her 
irresponsibly.
Background
Miss T took one running credit facility  (RCF) and then 13 instalment loans. Ive included  
some of the information  weve  received  from Sunny about these loans  below:
loan number loan amount received date actual  repayment date
1* £500.00 20/10/2014 03/03/2015
2 £100.00 10/07/2015 25/09/2015
3 £100.00 13/07/2015 10/08/2015
4 £150.00 14/07/2015 02/10/2015
5 £250.00 10/08/2015 02/10/2015
6 £150.00 25/09/2015 17/11/2015
7 £350.00 09/10/2015 17/11/2015
8 £200.00 27/12/2015 04/01/2016
9 £100.00 31/12/2015 04/01/2016
10 £200.00 23/04/2016 03/05/2016
11 £200.00 24/05/2016 01/07/2016
12 £150.00 29/05/2016 03/08/2016
13 £250.00 22/06/2016 17/08/2016
14 £50.00 26/07/2016 03/08/2016
*The RCF is different to the instalment loans. The RCF allowed Miss T to either request 
funds up to her agreed credit limit in one go or take multiple drawdowns up to that limit. It 
appears Miss T had a credit limit of £500. Each drawdown could be repaid via five monthly 
instalments. 
In our assessment our adjudicator thought  Sunny hadnt made  an error when it gave Miss T 
her RCF and the first five instalment loans. But he thought it was wrong for Sunny to have 
granted loans  6  13. He didnt consider loan 14 because Sunny had already agreed 
something may have  gone wrong  when  this loan was provided.  
Miss T appears  to have accepted what our adjudicator said.  
Sunny didnt provide a full response as to why it felt the adjudicator was wrong. However, it 
did tell us it had carried out a review  of the complaint and it now felt that loans 10  14 
shouldnt have been given. 
This offer was put to Miss T but she didnt accept it.  As no agreement could be reached, the 
case has been passed to me for a final decision.
Ref: DRN47766882My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Miss T appears  to have accepted the adjudicators findings about  loans 1 - 5 and Sunny has 
accepted that loans  10  14 shouldnt have been given. It seems this lending isnt in dispute 
and so I no longer  think that I need  to make a finding about those loans. But I have included  
loans 10  14 into the redress at the end of this decision. 
So instead,  this decision will focus on whether Sunny  did anything wrong when it granted 
loans 6  9. But I have kept the other lending in mind when thinking about the overall lending 
relationship between Sunny and Miss T. 
For the lending  that remains in dispute Sunny had to assess Miss Ts situation to check if 
she could afford to pay back the amounts  shed  borrowed without undue  difficulty.  It needed 
to do this in a way which  was proportionate  to the circumstances. Sunnys checks  could 
have taken into account a number of different things, such  as how much was being lent, the 
size of the repayments and Miss Ts income and expenditure. With this in mind, I think in the 
early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might  have been proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Miss T. These factors include:
Miss T having a low income (reflecting that it could  be more  difficult  to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Miss T having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long 
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Miss T coming  back for loans shortly  after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Miss T.
Sunny was required to establish whether Miss T could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether he technically  had enough  money to make  her repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments  could of course  be an indicator that Miss T was able to repay  her 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically  follow that this is the case.  The FCAs 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if they are made 
without undue difficulties  and in particular, made on time, while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to make them. If a lender realises, or ought 
reasonably to have  realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude  those  repayments  are 
unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ts complaint.
Ref: DRN47766883Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ts case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss T was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Miss T had taken  out 5 instalment loans in two months  and had 
used her RCF for five months.  In addition, Miss T had a number of loans overlapping, 
and loan 6 was taken out the same  day that loan 2 had been repaid. 
So Sunny ought to have  realised it was more  likely  than not Miss T was having to 
borrow further to cover  the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Ts indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ts first instalment loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £150.  At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that Miss T was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary 
shortfall in their income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
Miss T wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  nine 
(the last loan in dispute)  was taken out over a year after the RCF started and nearly 
six months after she started to borrow instalment loans.  And this loan was for the 
same value  as Miss Ts first instalment loan. Miss T had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Miss T lost out when Sunny provided loans 6 to 14 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ts indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period and;
the amount  of time and the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative 
implications on Miss Ts ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding  Miss Ts complaint about  loan 6 to 14. And Ive set out what Sunny should  
do to put things right as detailed below.
Ref: DRN47766884Putting things  right
Considering what  Sunny has already  agreed to do, in order to put things right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Miss T paid on loans 6  14
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove loans 6 to 14 from Miss Ts credit  file entirely, this is because the period of 
time Miss T owed  Sunny money  means that any information still recorded about 
these loans is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Miss T a certificate showing  how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Miss Ts complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Miss T as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 May 2020.
