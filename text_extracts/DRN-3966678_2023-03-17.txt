The complaint
K is a small business which holds a current account with ClearBank Limited. K was the 
victim of a fraud whereby money was taken from its ClearBank account. It wants ClearBank 
to refund the money it lost. 
(Ks account is operated through an IT platform provided by ClearBanks business partner 
with the brand name Tide. However, as ClearBank provided the account at the centre of 
this complaint, I have only used its name throughout this decision). 
What happened
The basic facts which led to this complaint are not in dispute. An outline follows.
As well as Ks account with ClearBank, it held accounts with several other banks and 
financial organisations. In April 2022, the fraudster sent a text message to a mobile phone 
belonging to K. The message asked K to click a link to pay a small extra fee for a delivery. 
This seems to have allowed the fraudster to obtain some information about some of Ks 
accounts. 
The next day, the fraudster rang K on the mobile phone pretending to be from one of the 
other financial organisations. The fraudster told K that (other) fraudsters had hacked into its 
account with ClearBank and that K should move money to other accounts which it described 
as safe. 
K then made three large payments to the accounts the fraudster specified. K used 
ClearBanks faster payment service to transfer the money. Within 80 minutes, it transferred 
the following sums: 
£15,001 to receiving bank one. (The first payment). 
£10,000 to receiving bank one. (The second payment). 
£6,140 to receiving bank two. (The third payment).
(I have rounded all monetary amounts to the nearest pound). 
The first and second payments were to new accounts. The third was to an existing account 
which K already held in its own name. At the fraudsters request, K then transferred the 
money from receiving bank two into another account it held with another bank and then into 
a cryptocurrency.
About four hours after K had made the third payment, it realised it had probably been a 
victim of fraud and reported the first two payments to ClearBank. As it held the relevant 
account for the third payment, it contacted receiving bank two directly. 
Two days later, after some further contact between ClearBank and K, ClearBank tried to 
recover the first and second payments from receiving bank one. Receiving bank one said 
that the money had already been moved on and there was nothing left for ClearBank to 
recover. 
K did not hear anything from receiving bank two. So, four days after K had made the 
payments, ClearBank contacted receiving bank two to try to recover Ks money from the 
third payment. After around two months, it recovered a small amount, around £15, which I 
believe has since been refunded to K. Im not sure if ClearBank or receiving bank two 
arranged this refund, but this is not particularly significant to the outcome of this complaint. 
K thinks that ClearBank should have noticed that all three payments were possibly 
fraudulent and stopped them, and that after it failed to do so, it should have acted more 
quickly to recover the money from the receiving banks. It wants ClearBank to refund all the 
money it has lost, a total of around £31,141. 
ClearBank does not think there was anything unusual about the three payments that 
suggested they were fraudulent and that it had no grounds to stop them or ask K about 
them. It accepts it should have tried to recover the money more quickly after K reported the 
fraud. But it has said that by this time the fraudster had moved all the money away from 
receiving bank one and almost all of it from receiving bank two, so it was already too late. It 
has, however, offered £75 to K as compensation for any inconvenience caused by this 
delay.
One of our investigators has already looked into Ks complaint and thought that ClearBank 
should have spotted that all three payments looked fraudulent and should have contacted K 
to check if it wanted to proceed. The investigator thought that if ClearBank had done this, K 
would have withdrawn its authority for the payments. However, the investigator didnt think 
that ClearBank was wholly responsible for Ks loss from payment three.
The investigator recommended that ClearBank should refund K all the money from 
payments one and two and half of the money from payment three, plus 8% simple interest 
from the date of the fraudulent payment until the date it makes the refund. The investigator 
also thought that ClearBank had handled Ks complaint poorly and should pay an additional 
£200 for distress and inconvenience.
ClearBank did not accept the investigators recommendations and asked for the complaint to 
be reviewed by an ombudsman. So, it has come to me to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of Ks complaint is that it believes ClearBank should have spotted the three 
payments were fraudulent and that as it didnt, it should refund the money K has lost. 
In broad terms, the starting position in law for case like this is that firms are expected to 
process the payments and withdrawals that a customer authorises it to make, in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of the customers account. 
However, taking into account the law, regulators rules and guidance, relevant codes of 
practice and what I consider was good industry practice at the time, I consider Clearbank 
should fairly and reasonably: Have been monitoring accounts and any payments made or received to counter 
various risks, including anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, 
and preventing fraud and scams. 
Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that 
might indicate that its customers were at risk of fraud (among other things). 
When K made the three payments, it followed ClearBanks procedure for online banking. By 
doing so, it effectively instructed ClearBank to move the money. I fully accept that it only did 
this because of the actions of the fraudster, but it effectively authorised ClearBank to make 
the payments. Frauds of this type are often called Authorised Push Payment (APP) frauds. 
It seems to me that the value of each payment was noticeably larger than K usually made 
from its ClearBank account. They were the largest for at least twelve months. And K had not 
made any previous payments to the account the fraudsters identified at receiving bank one. 
So, I think that ClearBank should have questioned all three payments with K before 
processing them. ClearBank didnt do this. It has made several points to explain why it didnt. 
Amongst other things it has said: 
For payments one and two, its automated system generated a check called 
Confirmation of Payee (COP) which alerted K that the name on the account at 
receiving bank one didnt match the sort code and account number. It has said that 
this should have been sufficient to alert K that something was wrong and that as K 
went ahead anyway, K was responsible for the loss. 
K had made large payments in the past from its account and such payments are 
common for business accounts. It doesnt think there was anything unusual about 
any of the three payments. 
At the time the payments took place, K was on the phone to the fraudster so wouldnt 
have been able to answer a call from ClearBank, so there would have been no point 
in it making one.
The fraudster pretended to be from a card provider which was not a bank and so K 
should have realized that it was a fraud when the fraudster talked about bank 
accounts. It has added that No bank would ever call (a customer) to discuss 
accounts held with another financial institution and this should have been a red flag 
for (K).
Its customers are businesses, and it would disrupt the running of their business if it 
paused payments in the way K has described. 
This fraud was unusual in that there were long gaps of around 25 minutes between 
payments one and two, and two and three. It has said that fraudsters usually drain 
accounts rapidly so in this case it had no indication that a fraud was taking place. 
I accept the sincerity of ClearBanks comments, but I dont think they justify its failure to act. 
With respect to COP, it can certainly help to reduce mistakes and errors, but on its own it is 
not fully effective at preventing APP. In this case, it seems the fraudster was coaching K in 
exactly how to proceed and so eliminated any effect COP could have had. 
I accept ClearBanks comments that K may have made large payments in the past, but I still 
think that all three payments were sufficiently unusual that ClearBank should have identified 
them as potentially fraudulent. And I dont think it was appropriate for ClearBank to disregard the fact that they were out of character for K because they may have been in character for 
other customers. 
I am not convinced by ClearBanks statement it couldnt have contacted K because of the 
phone call to the fraudsters. No phone call lasts for ever and ClearBank could have held the 
payment until K was available. ClearBank has also pointed out that if it had held the original 
payments, the fraudster could have coached K into making others. While this is certainly 
feasible, it is also conjecture. I do not think it is a convincing reason for ClearBank to have 
done nothing. 
Similarly, I do not think that its fair to say the fraudster discussing several accounts with K 
should have been a red flag for K. Im satisfied that the fraudster was convincing and had 
gained K s confidence at the time of the payments. Nor am I convinced by ClearBanks 
statement that pausing payments when fraud was indicated would disrupt its business 
customers so much that it would be unfeasible. 
ClearBank has also told us that several months after this fraud took place, it contacted K 
about concerns with a card transaction but K didnt respond. It has said that this shows K 
isnt very responsive to (its) messages and therefore was unlikely to have acted to stop any 
of the three payments in this fraud, even if it had intervened. I do not accept its conclusion. 
The two sets of circumstances may have been very different and I dont think its reasonable 
to extrapolate backwards from something recent to decide what may have happened in the 
past. 
So, after considering what ClearBank has told us, I still think it had sufficient grounds to 
notice that all three payments were potentially fraudulent and that it should have contacted K 
to question them. Had it done so, I think its highly likely that K would have withdrawn its 
authority for the three payments. 
Im satisfied that ClearBank was responsible for all of Ks loss from payments one and two. 
However, the third payment was slightly different. By this time, (as ClearBank mentioned) 
the phone call had been going on for at least an hour and would probably have been losing 
credibility. Also, the third payment went to one of Ks own accounts and so the fraud may 
have been less noticeable. And, at the end of the third payment, the money was still in an 
account over which K could exercise control. So, Ive considered whether K can be 
considered partially responsible for its losses from payment three. Ive considered what the 
law says about contributory negligence but also borne in mind the fact that I must reach a 
decision based on what I consider to be fair and reasonable. Im satisfied that K was equally 
responsible with ClearBank for the loss from payment three, so they both take 50% liability 
for this loss.
Before describing how ClearBank should put things right for K, I will briefly outline my 
findings about the point, which ClearBank accepts, that it did not act quickly enough to 
recover Ks money after K reported the fraud. I agree with ClearBanks view that by this time 
it was very probably too late to recover the money. Nonetheless, the delay would have been 
inconvenient for K. But, as I mentioned above, ClearBank has already offered K £75 for this 
inconvenience. I think this is appropriate compensation in this case and I wont tell 
ClearBank to increase it. 
Putting things right
To put things right for K, ClearBank should return it to the financial position it would have 
been in if the losses for which ClearBank was responsible had not happened. 
 
ClearBank should therefore:Refund K all of payments one and two and half of payment three, a total amount of 
£28,071. (ClearBank may deduct any funds which have already been returned to K) 
Add simple interest to the refund at the rate of 8% per year from the date of the fraud 
until the date it makes the refund. 
If ClearBank has not already paid K the £75 it offered for its delay in trying to recover the 
money, then it should add this amount to the above compensation. But it does not need to 
pay anything further for the way it handled Ks complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have set out above, I am upholding Ks complaint about ClearBank 
Limited. If K accepts my decision, ClearBank should pay it the compensation I have 
described.. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask K to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 April 2023.
