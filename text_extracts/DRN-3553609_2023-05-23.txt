DRN-3553609
The complaint
Mr D complains that MBNA Limited wont refund to him the money that he and his wife paid 
for a holiday product. Hes being represented in his complaint by a claims management 
company.
What happened
Mr D and his wife entered into a vacation plan purchase agreement in November 2014 to 
buy an interest in a timeshare project. The total price payable under the agreement was 
US$41,089 and Mr D paid a 10% deposit using his MBNA credit card. The agreement says 
that the balance was to be financed and further payments were paid from Mr Ds MBNA 
credit card accounts. 
Mr Ds representative made a claim to MBNA in July 2019 under section 75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974. It said that the membership had been misrepresented to Mr D and his wife 
and that the holiday company had breached the contract. MBNA declined the claim because 
it said that there was no evidence that a misrepresentation or breach of contract had 
occurred. Mr D wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service 
that the holiday company was in breach of the contract by misrepresenting the contract to 
Mr D and his wife and breaching the EU Timeshare Directive.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ds complaint should be upheld as she didnt 
think that MBNAs decision to turn down his claim was unfair or unreasonable. She wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think that the 
holiday company had breached the contract agreed between it and Mr D.
Mr Ds representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. Mr D says that he doesnt accept our investigators recommendation as 
extremely high stress sales models were applied to him and his wife so they felt that they 
had no option but to sign the contract and a solicitor who checked the contract says that it 
was not done correctly with many errors and was invalid so he sent the holiday company 
documents cancelling the contract. He also says that MBNA continued to allow payments 
from his credit card accounts after he had asked it to stop them and when one account 
ended it automatically moved payments to another account without permission.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ds complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Ds claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right to 
claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);
Mr Ds claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday 
company and that the membership was misrepresented to him and his wife and that 
they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them;
Im not determining the outcome of that claim in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not MBNAs response to his claim 
was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr D has said in response in response to our investigators recommendations that 
the holiday company applied extremely high stress sales models to him and his wife 
and that MBNA continued to allow payments from his credit card accounts after he 
had asked it to stop them  but those issues werent included with the claim that his 
representative made to MBNA in July 2019 or in the complaint form that he signed  
so Im unable to consider those issues as part of this complaint;
if Mr D wants to complain about those issues he should first complain to MBNA about 
them and then, if hes not satisfied with its response, he may be able to make a 
separate complaint to this service;
Mr Ds complaint form says that the holiday company breached the EU Timeshare 
Directive  but neither the holiday company nor the holiday product is based in the 
EU so I dont consider that the EU Timeshare Directive would be applicable in these 
circumstances;
Mr Ds complaint form also says that the holiday company was in breach of the 
contract by misrepresenting the contract to Mr D and his wife, and his 
representatives letter to MBNA in July 2019 describes the misrepresentations that it 
says were made to Mr D and his wife, including:
they were advised that by becoming members of the resort they would be 
able to book holidays more easily and readily;
they were assured that they would continue to receive the same service they 
witnessed during the tour of the resort; and
they were assured that the resort was exclusive to members;
that letter says that Mr D and his wife have found that theyre unable to get the 
availability that they require, the resorts availability has become more restricted and 
they are no longer able to reserve the accommodation to the same luxury standard, 
and the resort can be booked by any member of the public using third party booking 
agencies;
Mr D and his wife signed a vacation plan purchase agreement in November 2014 
and Ive only been provided with the first and third pages of the six page agreement 
and not the general terms and conditions, the declaration of condominium for the 
resort, the declaration of covenants, conditions, and restrictions for vacation plan 
ownership in the resort, the club by-laws or the club rules, all of which are referred to 
in the agreement; 
Mr Ds representative says that when Mr D and his wife enquired about availability 
they were advised that they would need to book a year in advance to get the holidays 
that they desired  but Ive seen no evidence to show that they complained to the 
holiday company about those issues or the holiday product being misrepresented to 
them and they didnt make a claim to MBNA about those issues until July 2019, 
nearly five years after theyd signed the agreement;
Im not persuaded that theres enough to show that Mr D and his wife were advised 
that by becoming members of the resort they would be able to book holidays more 
easily and readily or that they were assured that they would continue to receive the same service they witnessed during the tour of the resort or that they were assured 
that the resort was exclusive to members;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday product was 
misrepresented to Mr D and his wife by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the purchase agreement to buy the holiday product by any 
such misrepresentations;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show the purchase agreement is 
incorrect, contains errors or was invalid or that the holiday company has breached 
the purchase agreement  and Mr D hasnt provided evidence to show that he sent 
the holiday company documents cancelling the purchase agreement or that he was 
entitled to cancel the purchase agreement in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr D and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their holiday 
product but I consider that MBNAs response to their section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances; and 
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require MBNA to refund to Mr D 
any of the money that he and his wife paid for the holiday product, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 June 2023.
