K821x#15complaint
Mr Es complaint is about the amount of compensation Capital One (Europe) plc, offered 
following a complaint about a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy  taken out by Mr E 
in 2006.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In this decision Ive only considered the complaint about the commission and profit  share 
Capital One got due to the PPI. Ive only looked at whether the offer Capital  One has made  
is fair.  
In 2017, following a Supreme Court judgment, the Financial  Conduct  Authority (FCA), 
issued some new rules about  how businesses should deal with complaints about PPI.
The FCA said that if a business got a high level of commission and profit  share from the PPI 
policy  more than 50% of the PPI premium   and it didnt tell the consumer, then that could 
create an unfair relationship between the parties.  So to put that right,  the FCA said that 
businesses should  pay back  the amount of commission  and profit share that was more than 
50% of the PPI premium.
Capital One said that the level of commission and profit  share it received did create  an unfair 
relationship. So to put things right it offered to refund the extra  Mr E paid each month 
because the commission  and profit share  it received was more  than 50% of the cost of PPI 
for the time there was an unfair relationship. It also included 8% per year simple interest to 
compensate Mr E for the time he was out of pocket. 
Mr E has said he should receive  all the commission  and profit  share back because  he wasnt 
told that Capital  One would receive  any commission. But Capital One has done  what the 
rules it must follow tell it to do. 
Ive thought about whether theres anything about  Mr Es particular  complaint  and 
circumstances that means Capital  One should do something different to put right the 
unfairness caused by not telling them about  the amount of commission and profit  share it 
got. But I dont  think there  is. I think the offer thats been made is a fair way to resolve this 
complaint. So I wont  be telling Capital One to do anything more.   
my final decision
For the reasons  above I think Capital One (Europe) plc has correctly worked out what it 
needs to pay Mr E. 
Capital One (Europe) plc should update  and pay its offer to Mr E if it hasnt done so already.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 April 2019.
