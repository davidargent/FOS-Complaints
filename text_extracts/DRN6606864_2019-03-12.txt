K820x#14complaint
Mr F says Lloyds  Bank PLC (Lloyds)  mis-sold him a Premier packaged bank  account.  Hes 
used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to make his complaint.
background
Lloyds agreed  that it mis-sold the Premier  account and offered the difference in fees 
between it and the cheaper  Platinum account,  plus interest, in order to put things  right. Our 
adjudicators looked at Mr Fs complaint  and didnt think Lloyds had treated him unfairly. The 
CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Fs complaint. 
Having carefully looked  at everything  provided,  Im not upholding Mr Fs complaint. Id like to 
explain the reasons  for my decision. I think Mr F chose to take the Premier account. He also 
appears to have had an identifiable need for one of the main benefits  on the cheaper 
Platinum account   winter  sports cover  on travel insurance - and Ive seen no reason why he 
couldnt have  used this and the other benefits too. 
So overall I dont  think that Lloyds decision to offer the difference in fees between the 
Premier and Platinum account, plus interest,  is unfair given the particular circumstances of 
Mr Fs complaint. And, in these circumstances, Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Fs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 April 2019.
