K820x#14complaint
Mr B and Mr R complain  that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) treated them unfairly 
by closing their joint current account.
Background
On 19 March 2019, NatWest sent letters to Mr B and Mr R separately.  Both letters listed  
their joint current  account ending 1740  and said:
We, National Westminster Bank  Plc, have recently  undertaken  a review of the 
banking arrangements that you have  with us. We have, with regret, reached the 
conclusion that we will no longer provide these facilities  for you.
Consequently, you will need  to make alternative  banking arrangements within  
60 days of the date of this letter.  These arrangements  must be outside  of The Royal 
Bank of Scotland Group plc, which includes National Westminster  Bank  Plc...
We assure you that we have only reached this decision after careful consideration, 
however, our decision is final and we are not prepared to enter into any discussion in 
relation to it.
Around a week  later, Mr B called NatWest. He said Ive received, me and my partner have 
received, letters from yourselves shutting all accounts down including [another] account 
within 60 days. The person  Mr B spoke to explained NatWest doesnt  have to give a reason, 
but he could appeal the banks decision to close his account. During  this call, NatWest  asked  
for details  of the accounts and Mr B said Ill just choose one of these ones that are on the 
letter. Ill give you [the number of one of Mr Bs current accounts]. Mr B wanted a reason for 
the account closures, saying the account  closure  was unfair   he said that whilst he and 
Mr R are gamblers,  its above board. NatWest reiterated its not required to provide a reason 
for its decision to close their accounts.  
Unhappy with this response,  Mr B and Mr R referred  their complaint to our service. 
Mr B and Mr R say NatWests decision to close their account  was discriminatory and may be 
related to their legitimate  gambling
One of our investigators  reviewed Mr B and Mr Rs complaint but didnt uphold it. The 
investigator was satisfied NatWest wrote  to Mr B and Mr R on 19 March 2019  giving  them 
notice their joint account would be closed. Our investigator didnt think there was any 
evidence of discrimination in NatWests decision to close their joint account.  The investigator 
said the terms and conditions of Mr B and Mr Rs account allowed  NatWest to close their 
account with 60 days notice. 
Mr B didnt agree, reiterating his concerns about NatWest and asked for an ombudsman to 
review this complaint.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN25066802The terms and conditions  of Mr B and Mr Rs joint account set out that NatWest can close  
their current  account by giving them at least 60 days notice. Im satisfied  that on 
19 March 2019,  NatWest gave 60 days notice of its intention to close  Mr B and Mr Rs joint 
account. And having listened to Mr Bs calls with NatWest,  I think  its likely Mr B and Mr R 
received NatWests letter of 19 March 2019  and were aware  NatWest  had given them  
60 days notice of its intention to close their account. 
Mr B and Mr R want to know  why NatWest decided to close their account and believe its 
decision is related  to their gambling. The terms of their account  dont  require NatWest  to 
disclose the reason for its decision so I cant say it was obliged to tell Mr B and Mr R why it 
decided to close their accounts. On a call to NatWest, I did hear Mr B explain  his suspicions 
about why NatWest decided to close their account, but I dont  think  NatWest said it decided 
to close their account because they gamble.
Whilst I appreciate Mr B and Mr R are disappointed with NatWests decision,  I think  it was 
entitled to give  and did give them  60 days notice of its intention to close  their joint 
account. 
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above, I dont  uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B and Mr R to 
accept or reject my decision  before  15 December  2019.
