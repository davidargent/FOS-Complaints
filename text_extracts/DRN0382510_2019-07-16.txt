Mr H complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC trading as QuickQuid was irresponsible when it 
provided him with a number of loans.
background
Mr H took 11 loans  with QuickQuid between April 2008 and March 2010. They ranged from 
£150 to £1,450. Below is a table  I've prepared  from some  of the information QuickQuid has 
provided about Mr Hs loans.

QuickQuid initially objected to this Service looking into Mr Hs complaint because  it said that 
hed complained too late. It then lifted that objection, but didnt agree with our adjudicators 
assessment of the merits of Mr Hs complaint. Our adjudicator recommended  that Mr Hs 
complaint be upheld from Loans  3 onwards  in other words  the loans taken from 10 
December 2008.  As no agreement  could  be reached the matter came to me - an 
ombudsman - for a decision.
A few weeks  ago I issued  a provisional  decision in which  I explained why I was minded to 
uphold Mr Hs complaint  for similar  reasons to our adjudicator.  But, as I was considering  
making a different award  of compensation to Mr H, I wanted to give the parties an 
opportunity to provide me with anything further they wanted me to think about before I 
reached my final decision.
my findings
Ive once again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Mr H has accepted  my provisional  
decision and QuickQuid  has confirmed  it has nothing further to add. In these circumstances I 
see no reason to alter my provisional findings and I uphold Mr Hs complaint for the reasons 
I outlined in my provisional decision. 
This is what  I said in my provisional  decision:
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending  including all of
the relevant rules, guidance  and good industry practice  on our website.
Ref: DRN03825102Broadly speaking QuickQuid  needed to take reasonable  care when providing loans to
borrowers and to take account of their interests when  doing so. It had to ensure it didnt lend
irresponsibly.
In practice, this means it should have  carried out proportionate checks  before providing the
loans. And as well as considering the individual affordability  of each loan, QuickQuid should
also have stepped back and looked at the overall pattern of lending  to see if there was a
point at which  it ought  to have realised it wasnt in the best interests of Mr H to continue
making advances. In other words, did the pattern of lending suggest  Mr H was in a difficulty
or that the borrowing had otherwise become  problematic?  And if so, did QuickQuid act fairly
and reasonably by continuing to approve advances after that point?
Mr H has confirmed  that he accepts our adjudicators  assessment about the loans which
were being  upheld  so it seems  that Loans 1 and 2 are no longer in issue.  So I dont need
to address whether  they were responsibly lent. But they do form part of my considerations
about what happened during  the later sequence of loans.
When Mr H took Loan 3 hed been indebted to QuickQuid for almost eight months with only
11 days gap between Loans 1 and 2, and 12 days between  Loans 2 and 3. The amounts  he
was borrowing were increasing rapidly. And Mr H had applied to delay the repayment  of
Loan 2 on four occasions  so it took him 140 days to repay a loan intended  to last 50 days.
These factors were indicative  of a borrower clearly struggling to manage their finances  one
who was dependent on short  term loans  to bridge  holes in his finances most likely caused by
having to repay earlier loans. This history and pattern of lending demonstrates that further
lending would  likely be unsustainable  for Mr H.
Indeed after repaying Loan 3 Mr H came back for Loan 4, five days later  this time for £700
with a highest  repayment of £875. After rolling over this loan at the end of April 2009 Mr H
wrote to QuickQuid in the following terms in May 2009:
I did call your customer service team last week to ask to set up a payment plan to
pay this loan off completely. I'm really  struggling to meet my monthly  outgoings and I
do not see that I will ever pay this loan off and will just keep paying the monthly loan
payment and it's got to the point  now where  I can't even afford to do that. I would like
to set up a payment arrangement with you to pay £50 per month,  starting  from 29th
May, to pay the full amount  of £840. This is all I can afford and I want  to come to an
agreement with you for this amount and would appreciate  it if I could speak  with
someone to set this up. I really do need your help as I am really struggling to
maintain this loan and just want to pay it off, so would  be grateful if someone could
contact me to set this arrangement up
I think  this demonstrates  that Mr H was in serious  difficulties. Although no further interest
was charged on this loan, he was charged a late fee at the end of May 2009. And he went
on to repay  the loan in full on 1 July. A week later - fully appraised of how difficult Mr H was
finding his financial situation  - QuickQuid lent him £700 again. He repaid that at the end of
July and a few days later he borrowed again - even more - £900. I accept  that Loan 7 was
for a smaller amount but from that point the amounts being borrowed  increased significantly
so that his last three loans  were for £1,450.
I've thought about the points QuickQuid raised  in response to our adjudicators assessment.
In that it describes Mr H as a good  customer who carried multiple payday loans.  Im
unclear as to what QuickQuid means by this. I accept that Mr H did have multiple  loans and
that he did repay  them  (with  the exception of Loan 11 which Ill refer to below). But the fact
that someone has a lot of loans which they repay, in the circumstances seen in Mr Hs case
doesnt necessarily mean that the lender was acting responsibly. The email  mentioned
above demonstrated Mr H was in financial difficulty but QuickQuid went on to provide him
Ref: DRN03825103with seven  loans totalling  around  £7,250 over the following ten months.
QuickQuid has also explained that it carried out various  checks when assessing  Mr Hs loan
applications. But, as I've said, it had to do more than simply check  a loan looked affordable
on a pounds  and pence basis. It had to act responsibly  taking full account  of Mr Hs interests
when agreeing to lend.
Quick Quid  should have known that further borrowing  after Loan 3 was likely to be
unsustainable for Mr H and was potentially harmful, given the high interest he needed to pay
and the record that repeat  borrowing would  leave on his credit  file. But even  after it received
the email from Mr H pattern  of lending continued - only ceasing at the point Mr H fell into
arrears with Loan 11.
With all this in mind  Im satisfied  that QuickQuid was irresponsible when it provided  Loans 3
to 11.
The statement of account provided  by QuickQuid suggests that Mr H has an outstanding
balance of £1,582 on Loan  11. But he has told us  and shown  us correspondence  from a
third party debt collector - that Loan 11 was sold on by QuickQuid. I've seen  a number of
emails from the third party including one which told Mr H that the debt had been assigned to
it by QuickQuid in October 2010.
Mr H tells us that he ended up paying the third party  not only the outstanding balance  but
also bailiff fees - in around August 2011. He tells us that he paid around £1,784 to clear it
with some help from his mother.
So it seems  that Mr H has repaid Loan  11 plus some additional fees to a third party. But that
information is not showing on QuickQuids statement of account. From  that I can see Mr H
also paid QuickQuid  £344 in interest  and charges  before the loan was sold on with a balance
owing of £1,582. As it seems Mr H hadnt repaid  any of the capital to QuickQuid before the
loan was assigned to the third party, the balance  which was assigned included  the full
amount of capital. This would mean that when Mr H paid the third party £1,784,  part of that
was capital  (£1,450)  suggesting that he paid £334 in fees and charges to the third party.
I've taken  this into account  when considering what I think QuickQuid should do to put things
right.
If either Mr H or QuickQuid  are able to provide any evidence, such as statements  of account,
to clarify  the exact sums  I will of course take those into account when I reconsider my
decision.
But based on the information I currently have this is how I intend to require QuickQuid  to put
things right:
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid to QuickQuid on the loans he took from and
including Loan 3 on 10 December 2008 to loan 11 taken on 1 March 2010
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
refund the sum of £334 to Mr H - which is the amount of interest and charges  Mr H
paid to the third party debt collector:
pay interest of 8% simple a year on the refunded interest and charges paid to the
third party from 31 August 2011*
the number of loans taken from 10 December  2008 onwards means  any information
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans approved from this point
onwards should be removed from Mr Hs credit file.
Ref: DRN03825104*HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. 
QuickQuid must give Mr H a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
putting things right
I invited QuickQuid and Mr H to provide me with any further evidence - such  as statements 
of account - which would  confirm the details of what Mr H paid to the third party  debt 
collector. But neither  of them  has sent me anything more. So - and as I mentioned above, as 
neither has anything further  to say about  my provisional decision  my decision is as follows.  
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC trading  as QuickQuid to put things right in the following  
way:
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid to QuickQuid on the loans he took from and 
including Loan 3 on 10 December 2008  to loan 11 taken on 1 March 2010
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
refund  the sum of £334 to Mr H - which is the amount of interest and charges Mr H 
paid to the third party debt collector:
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on the refunded  interest  and charges (£334) paid to 
the third party from 31 August 2011:  
the number  of loans taken from 10 December  2008 onwards  means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about  loans approved  from this 
point onwards should be removed  from Mr Hs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must 
give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above and in my provisional decision I uphold Mr Hs complaint in 
part and require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things right in the way I've explained.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 August 2019.
