K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains about how BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited (BMWFS) has 
administered and managed his debt with it. He is concerned that he may have been over 
charged interest and that the new monthly  payments set (following his decision to make part 
repayments) were incorrect.
background
Mr B entered into a hire purchase  agreement with BMWFS in June 2018  for £30,636.19  to 
acquire a new car. Under  the terms of the HP agreement Mr B undertook, everything else 
being equal, to make 35 monthly debt repayments  of £491.85 followed by 1 debt repayment  
of £16,113.02  making a total repayable (excluding a £5,000 advance payment) of 
£33,327.77 at an APR of 3.9%.
Mr B, as he was entitled to do, made the following debt repayments instead.
Date £ Type
30/07/18 £491.85 monthly direct debit
29/08/18 £491.85 monthly direct debit
27/09/18 £5,000.00 part repayment/settlement
01/10/18 £491.85 monthly direct debit
30/10/18 £330.70 monthly direct debit
31/10/18 £8,000.00 part repayment/settlement
30/11/18 £62.21 monthly direct debit
31/12/18 £62.21 monthly direct debit
31/01/19 £62.21 monthly direct debit
20/02/19 £16,371.59 full repayment/settlement
Total £31,364.47
Capital £30,636.19
Interest £728.28
The monthly payment  of £330.70 and £62.21 was set by BMWFS after Mr B made partial  
debt repayments  of £5,000 and £8,000 respectively.
Mr Bs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded  that he wasnt 
persuaded that BMWFS  had done  anything wrong.  He also said that our services role isnt 
an accounting one.
Mr B disagreed with the investigators conclusion and so his complaint was passed  to me for 
review and decision. 
I issued a provisional decision on this case in February 2021. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I can confirm that Im not 
persuaded that this complaint should  be upheld.
Ref: DRN27108182To explain why, it might  help if I set out our starting position on complaints of possible 
accounting errors generally; which is that the Financial Ombudsman Service doesnt provide 
an account checking service. 
Mr B has provided his own calculations. Hes clearly put a lot of thought effort  and time into 
these and, understandably,  holds them in great  store.  But my difficulty  is that Ive no reason 
to consider Mr Bs calculations as being  any more  or less correct than the statement of 
account and calculations provided by BMWFS.
In other  words, I cant  rely on Mr Bs calculations or attach any evidential  weight to them. 
Whats needed  here,  in effect, is a forensic check of Mr Bs account by an independent 
party. If Mr B remains of the view that BMWFS statement  of account and calculations are 
wrong, and he has suffered financially as a result, its for him to arrange for the account to be 
audited by a suitably qualified and independent party, and the evidence  of the audit could 
then be used as the basis for a new complaint, but not as the basis  for this one. 
I say that the evidence  of an audit could then be used as a basis for a new complaint  
because BMWFS would need to be presented with the finished audit first and be given the 
opportunity to consider and respond to it before we could get further  involved.  
Mr B would have to meet the cost of the audit, albeit if errors  were found that were to Mr Bs 
detriment, we would then expect BMWFS to reimburse any reasonable cost of the audit  as 
well as taking any corrective action the audit revealed to be necessary. But as things stand, 
the evidence available  to me to consider doesnt persuade  me that Mr B has suffered a loss 
as result of BMWFS  management and administration of his debt.
BMWFS didnt respond to my provisional decision.
Mr B responded to my provisional decision to say he was disappointed with it. In summary 
he said:
I hadnt addressed  his complaint  appropriately
after 20 months I had simply concluded  we cant really tell [if there  have been  any 
accounting errors on the part of BMWFS  and that he] should get an independent  
audit
he wont get an independent audit given the sums involved
the issue isnt one of accounting,  but one of correct application of consumer finance 
law, which manifests  itself in the numbers
he expected  our service to have been  able to check BMWFS various  calculations  
and rule accordingly, but we havent done so
figures provided by BMWFS, following one of his partial repayments, are clearly not 
consistent with a reducing loan subject to a fixed  rate of interest [and this should ring] 
alarm bells
Ref: DRN27108183my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
I accept that Mr B is complaining that in his view BMWFS might  have  failed to apply correctly 
his rights under the Consumer Credit (Early Settlement) Regulations 2004. But as I said in 
my provisional decision its for Mr B to provide evidence from an independent third party that 
this is the case and this will, by its very nature, involve an accounting check  or audit.
Furthermore, I would  add that even if our service was able to carry out an accounting  check  
or audit  this would  be restricted  to what Mr B ended up paying under the agreement and not 
what he might have  ended up paying  had he not settled his loan in full in February 2019.
Finally, I would add that had there  been  obvious errors in BMWFS  administration  and 
management of Mr Bs debt then I might have come  to a different conclusion. But and I 
appreciate that this will be of little comfort to Mr B, I cant  see that there have been any 
obvious errors on the part of BMWFS.
I appreciate Mr B will be disappointed but having considered his response to my provisional  
decision I see no reason  to depart from it and I now confirm it as final.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 April 2021.
