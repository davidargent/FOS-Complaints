The complaint
Mrs M complains that MBNA Limited wont refund to her the money that she paid for some 
holiday club membership points. Shes being represented in her complaint by a claims 
management company.
What happened
Mrs M and her husband entered into a purchase and security agreement in October 2014 to 
buy some holiday club membership points. The price of the points was $47,500 and the 
agreement also included closing costs of $790 and other costs of $2,535. The deposit was 
$14,250 and Mrs M made a payment of £8,345.94 in February 2015 using her MBNA credit 
card.
Mrs Ms representative made a claim to MBNA under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974 in April 2019 that the membership was misrepresented to Mrs M and her husband and 
that the contract was breached. MBNA says that it didnt receive that claim. Mrs M 
complained to this service and the complaint was forwarded to MBNA. The complaint form 
said that the holiday company and MBNA had failed to conduct a proper assessment of 
Mrs Ms ability to afford the loan, MBNA paid a commission to the holiday company which 
wasnt declared to Mrs M and the holiday company unduly pressured Mrs M into entering 
into a contract with the holiday company and a finance agreement with MBNA all of which 
rendered the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act. MBNA 
said that the contract value was more than £30,000 so section 75 didnt apply. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Ms complaint should be upheld. He wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and he didnt think that the 
holiday company had breached the contract. He didnt think that MBNA was under any 
obligation to carry out the checks that Mrs Ms representative had suggested that it should 
have.
Mrs Ms representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has provided a response from Mrs M in which she says, in summary, that:
she and her husband were given no cooling off time;
they were promised a dream holiday to any destination but only two holidays were 
available and they were told that they would be charged for it unless they attended 
another sales meeting;
there have been issues with the availability of holidays and theyve cost less than the 
annual service charge; and
the whole ghastly situation was nothing but threats and a huge amount of money that 
theyve still not received back.
Mr Ms representative has also provided a counsels generic submissions about purchases 
of points from the holiday company. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Ms complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mrs Ms claim was made under section 75 which gives a consumer an equal right to 
claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been 
a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain 
criteria set out in that section are met);
Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Ms claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not MBNAs response to her 
claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mrs M and her husband signed the purchase and security agreement which says: 
Seller and Purchaser agree that this agreement  embodies the entire agreement 
between them  Oral representations of Seller or Sellers agents should not be 
relied upon by Purchaser  For correct representations, Purchaser should rely 
entirely on the Agreement and the documents and instruments contained by 
reference;
Mrs Ms representative has described the ways that it says that the membership was 
misrepresented to Mrs M and her husband, including that they would make 
significant savings on their holidays and would be able to book holidays more easily, 
it was an investment, they would receive a free dream holiday and would be able to 
holiday in Australia;
it's my understanding that Mrs M and her husband would be able to use the holiday 
club membership points on the terms agreed with the holiday company (including the 
payment of service charges);
Ive seen no reference in the purchase and security agreement or the other 
documents from the time of sale to show that Mrs M and her husband would make 
significant savings on their holidays and would be able to book holidays more easily, 
that the membership was an investment, that they would receive a free dream 
holiday to Australia or that they would be able to holiday in Australia; 
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect any offer of a free dream holiday to 
Australia to be evidenced in writing and that, if Mrs M and her husband had issues 
with the holiday that was provided to them, they would have raised any concerns 
about it sooner than they did - they entered into the purchase and security agreement 
in October 2014 and Ive seen no evidence to show that they complained about 
issues with the offer until April 2019;
Im not persuaded that Mrs M and her representative have provided enough evidence 
to show that the holiday company told Mrs M and her husband that they would make 
significant savings on their holidays and would be able to book holidays more easily, 
that the membership was an investment, that they would receive a free dream 
holiday to Australia or that they would be able to holiday in Australia;
I dont consider that Mrs M and her representative have provided enough evidence to 
show that Mrs M and her husband were induced into entering into the purchase and 
security agreement to buy the membership points by misrepresentations made by the 
holiday company;Mrs M says that she and her husband were given no cooling off time  but the 
purchase agreement specified the law which governed the agreement and under 
which it was to be construed  and Ive seen no evidence to show that the applicable 
law required Mrs M and her husband to be given a period in which they could 
withdraw from the agreement;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract by the holiday company in these circumstances or that theres been any 
breach of laws or regulations for which MBNA would be liable;
Mrs Ms representative has provided a counsels generic submissions about 
purchases of points from the holiday company  but Im not persuaded that its 
enough to show that Mrs Ms complaint about MBNAs response to her section 75 
claim should be upheld;
one of the criteria for a claim under section 75 is that the cash price for any single 
item must be at least £100 but not more than £30,000  as I dont consider that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company for 
which MBNA would be liable under section 75, I dont consider that theres any need 
for me to make a finding as to whether or not the purchase price of the membership 
points was within the limits for a claim under section 75;
Mrs Ms representatives letter to MBNA in April 2019 related to a claim under section 
75  the letter was headed Section 75 claim, the letter was about a claim under 
section 75 and there was no mention in that letter of a claim under section 140A;
Mrs Ms complaint form did refer to section 140A and it said that MBNA had failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of Mrs Ms ability to afford the loan, it had paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mrs M and the holiday 
company unduly pressured Mrs M into entering into a contract with the holiday 
company and a finance agreement with MBNA - but a complaint under section 140A 
hadnt been made to MBNA at that time by Mrs M or her representative;
in its final response to Mrs M in March 2020, MBNA responded to her section 75 
claim and her claim about its credit check - our investigator then didnt consider any 
claim under section 140A but he did say that Mrs M had paid for the points in part 
using a credit card with MBNA that was taken out in July 1998 and that she had a 
credit limit large enough to help her to fund her purchase and he didnt think that 
MBNA was under any obligation to carry out further credit checks;
I dont consider that a complaint under section 140A about an unfair relationship 
between MBNA and Mrs M has been properly made so I havent considered any 
such claim in this decision  if Mrs M wants to make a claim to MBNA under section 
140A she should first contact MBNA and then, if shes not satisfied with its response, 
she may be able to make a separate complaint about those issues to this service;
Mrs M used her MBNA credit card to pay £8,345.94 towards the cost of the 
membership points and MBNA says that her account was opened in July 1998 and 
that it conducted a credit check in order to provide her with a credit limit deemed 
suitable based on her credit file and its lending criteria;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs M had complained to MBNA about her credit 
limit or the credit checks that it had made until her representatives letter to MBNA in 
April 2019 and, if she was concerned about the credit checks that it had conducted or 
her credit limit, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have contacted 
MBNA about those issues before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that MBNA failed to conduct 
a proper assessment of Mrs Ms ability to afford the credit;I consider that MBNAs response to Mrs Ms section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable and Im not persuaded that its acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mrs M 
about these issues; and
I sympathise with Mrs M and her husband for the issues that theyve had with their 
membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require MBNA 
to refund to Mrs M any of the money that she paid for the membership points, to pay 
her any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 March 2023.
