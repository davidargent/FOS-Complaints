The complaint
Mr and Mrs C are unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt approve their 
mortgage application and they believe this forced them to apply for a mortgage with a 
different lender. They would like the early repayment charge (ERC) they were charged when 
they paid off the old mortgage to be refunded, as they believe this was only paid because 
NatWest incorrectly refused their application with it.
What happened
In early 2019 Mr and Mrs C had an existing mortgage with NatWest. They have told us they 
were planning to downsize and discussed taking out a new mortgage (for the same amount) 
and transferring their fixed interest rate products to the new mortgage. They received an 
agreement in principle and understood any application would be subject to underwriting. 
They have said that, because they knew their credit ratings were good, they wouldnt have 
any problems.
The fixed interest rate on part of the mortgage was due to come to an end in early spring 
2019 and Mr and Mrs C arranged a new interest rate deal for that part of the mortgage. They 
were aware the new rate had an ERC attached to it.
Their home was sold and they made an offer on one they wanted to buy. Mr and Mrs C 
applied for a new mortgage and to port their existing interest rate products to the new 
mortgage. This was in early June 2019. NatWest started the process of assessing the 
application and arranged a valuation on the property they were buying. However, the 
valuation was cancelled a few days later because the mortgage application was declined.
NatWests records show that the credit scoring it completed raised issues with the picture of 
Mr and Mrs Cs credit, including that Mrs C had undisclosed hire purchase of a significant 
amount.
Mr and Mrs C were told by their mortgage broker that it had discussed the matter with 
NatWest and been told the application had been declined due to the amount of other 
borrowing they had, some of which hadnt been disclosed. 
It came to light that a car finance agreement that had been paid off in 2017 was still showing 
as outstanding on Mrs Cs credit file. NatWest was given evidence about the car loan having 
been paid off and Mr and Mrs C confirmed that all other outstanding debts would be repaid 
from the equity they received from the sale of their house. Mr and Mrs C asked NatWest to 
reassess their application. The application was again declined on 20 June 2019. As they 
were at risk of losing the property they were buying, Mr and Mrs C applied to an alternative 
lender for a mortgage on 21 June 2019. That application was accepted on 3 July 2019. 
Mr and Mrs C complained to NatWest. The underwriting decision on their mortgage 
application was reviewed again and the decision to decline it was overturned on 3 July 2019. The application was accepted, subject to provision of up-to-date proof of income and a 
valuation.
In response to the complaint NatWest set out the events that had occurred and confirmed 
the previous declinature of the mortgage application had been overturned, subject to a 
valuation and up-to-date salary information. Mr and Mrs C, however, decided that they no 
longer wanted a mortgage with NatWest because their application had been declined; they 
would be moving forward with the mortgage with the other lender and wanted NatWest to 
waive the ERC. NatWest said its offer of lending put Mr and Mrs C in the position they would 
have been in but for its error and so would not waive the ERC. Instead it paid them £500 
compensation for its poor service. 
Mr and Mrs Cs mortgage with NatWest was repaid on 5 September 2019.
Mr and Mrs C were unhappy with NatWests response to their complaint and asked us to 
look at it. One of our investigators considered the complaint, but didnt recommend it be 
upheld. Mr and Mrs C asked that their complaint be referred to an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
I have considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has accepted that the service it provided Mr and Mrs C was below the level it 
should have been and it has paid them £500 compensation for that failing. Mr and Mrs C are 
not happy with that conclusion because they feel they were forced by the poor service to 
take their new mortgage elsewhere and so incurred an ERC they wouldnt otherwise have 
done. So I need to consider the actions of the parties and whether, rightly, NatWest should 
refund the ERC.
When NatWest assessed Mr and Mrs Cs application it ran a credit check. That check was 
not just obtaining their credit score, but also looking at the amount and type of credit they 
had. This revealed some undisclosed credit and an overall credit profile that NatWest wasnt 
happy with. Whilst the information NatWest was given has since been proven not to be 
entirely accurate, I dont think NatWest had any reason question the information when it was 
initially provided. As our investigator explained, a lender is entitled to rely on the information 
an independent credit reference agency provides. In light of the information NatWest had, it 
declined the application as it didnt meet its criteria. I dont think there was anything wrong 
with that decision. 
However, when Mr and Mrs C provided additional information and asked for the application 
to be assessed again, it doesnt appear this was done by an individual underwriter as they 
appear to have expected it to be. Rather it was reassessed through the computerised 
systems and declined again. That decision was overturned when the application was 
considered by a senior underwriter. This would seem to be the service failing NatWest has 
offered compensation for. It meant that the application process was delayed by nine working 
days.
This means that Mr and Mrs C received both NatWests conditional offer of lending and the 
offer from the other lender on the same day. Whilst Mr and Mrs C would have needed to 
provide some further information to NatWest and the valuation was needed, I think it 
reasonable to say that the NatWest mortgage could have been in place in time to buy the 
property. I say this as it was slightly over two months before completion on their purchase 
happened and a valuation would likely have taken no more than a week or two. It appears Mr and Mrs C had two viable options to purchase their new home. As such, I have 
considered Mr and Mrs Cs comments on their reason for choosing the option they did. They 
have said in the complaint form that they chose to take the mortgage with the other lender 
because NatWest wouldnt guarantee it would lend subject to a satisfactory valuation. They 
have also said they didnt want to progress with NatWest because of how it had treated them 
in declining their application.
I can understand that Mr and Mrs C would have been annoyed and frustrated with what 
happened with their mortgage application. However, the initial rejection of the application is 
not something I can find NatWest at fault for as its entitled to apply its lending criteria and do 
so based on the evidence it is provided with. There was then an error, but it was corrected in 
time to allow their purchase to progress without Mr and Mrs C having to incur an ERC. I am 
not persuaded the error NatWest made placed Mr and Mrs C in such a position as going 
forward with the NatWest mortgage was untenable. As they chose to take their mortgage 
with a different lender in the knowledge they would incur an ERC, but had an option to 
avoided paying it, I dont think it was unreasonable for NatWest to charge the ERC.
In relation to the compensation NatWest has paid Mr and Mrs C for its error, I think it is fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances. It is in line with what this service would ask NatWest to 
pay if we were making an award and so I wont ask it to pay more. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr and Mrs C to accept or reject my decision 
before 20 July 2020.
