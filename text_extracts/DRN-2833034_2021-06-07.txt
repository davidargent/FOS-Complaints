The complaint
Mrs P is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, have reported adverse information 
on her credit file.  
What happened
Mrs P had a direct debit set up to make payments of £150 per month to her PayPal credit 
account. In August 2020, Mrs P changed the payment amount of the direct debit, and this 
was done by Mrs P on the day before the direct debit was due. 
Mrs P received confirmation from PayPal that, because shed made the change shortly 
before the direct debit due date, the next direct debit taken would be done so at the prior 
payment amount and the change would only take effect for the following payment onwards.
The next month, in September 2020, Mrs P paid off the full outstanding balance of the credit. 
Shortly afterwards Mrs P noticed that PayPal were reporting a missed payment on her credit 
file. Mrs P wasnt happy about this, so she made a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mrs Ps complaint. They noted that because Mrs P had changed the direct 
debit amount in August so close to the due date, the August payment hadnt been made, 
and so the missed payment reporting was correct. So, they didnt uphold the complaint. Mrs 
P wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that the message that Mrs P had 
received from PayPal, which had advised her that her August would be taken, meant that it 
was reasonable for Mrs P to assume that the August payment would be taken. 
So our investigator recommended that the complaint be upheld in Mrs Ps favour and that 
PayPal should remove the adverse credit reporting from Mrs Ps credit file. Additionally, our 
investigator recommended that PayPal should make a payment of £100 to Mrs P to 
compensate her for the trouble and upset she had incurred.
PayPal didnt agree with the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so its clear that PayPal did advise Mrs P that they would be taking £150 in 
August 2020, as per the following correspondence.
Youve updated your monthly Direct Debit payment amounts towards your PayPal 
Credit balance.
The change will come into effect after your current payment due date, which is 16 
August 2020.
On that date, well take £150.00 GBP from your bank account, ending ****, as you 
previously instructed.
From your next statement, well automatically debit £**.** GBP each month from your 
bank account, ending ****, on your payment due date. 
Its reasonable then for Mrs P to have believed that PayPal would take the direct debit 
payment in August as they stated they would. And PayPal havent provided any evidence to 
this service contrary to that fact, such as correspondence to Mrs P advising her that her 
payment had been missed.
PayPal have stated that Mrs P had a responsibility to monitor the direct debit to ensure that it 
had been paid. I agree with this statement, but I also feel that by stating to Mrs P that the 
direct debit would be taken, PayPal effectively confirmed to Mrs P that the payment would be 
taken such that no further monitoring was required on her behalf.
Considering this, I dont feel that its fair that PayPal should have reported a missed payment 
to Mrs Ps credit file when the direct debit which they had confirmed would be taken, wasnt 
taken. And this is especially the case when I cant see any evidence of clear communication 
about this point, which is what this service would expect here.
It follows then that Ill be upholding this complaint in Mrs Ps favour and instructing PayPal to 
remove the adverse credit reporting from Mrs Ps credit file. Ill also be instructing PayPal to 
make a payment of £100 to Mrs P to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience that 
shes incurred.  
Putting things right
PayPal must remove the adverse reporting from Mrs Ps credit file such that it never 
occurred.
PayPal must also make a payment of £100 to Mrs P to compensate her for the trouble and 
upset she had incurred as a result of this matter.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal Europe Sarl and Cie, SCA, 
on the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2021.
