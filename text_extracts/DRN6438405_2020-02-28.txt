K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest)  sent text alerts about his 
account to his mothers mobile phone in breach of data protection laws. To settle matters 
hed like compensation and hed also like NatWest to admit  its mistake to apologise.
background
Mr B told us that he gave  his mother, Mrs B, a power of attorney over his account whilst he 
was travelling and working abroad. Mr B made  changes to standing orders on his account  
and NatWest sent Mrs B text alerts about  this. Mr B says NatWest  released personal data 
about his account to his mother without his consent.
NatWest didnt uphold  his complaint. It said that since Mrs B had a third party mandate  on 
his account since  1990 - and therefore  she was entitled to receive the information  contained  
in the text alert. It said it had updated Mrs Bs mobile  number on its records  in October 2018 
and she was automatically set up to receive text alerts for all accounts she was linked to.
Unhappy with NatWests  response,  Mr B referred his complaint  to our service.  One of our 
adjudicators investigated his complaint but didnt recommend it should be upheld.
Our adjudicator thought it reasonable that NatWest wasnt able to provide Mr Bs original 
instruction when he added his mother to his account. He was satisfied  that Mrs B was an 
authorised third party on Mr Bs account and was entitled to receive the information.
Following the adjudicators view, Mr B cant understand how hed made lots of changes to 
his direct debits and standing orders over the years yet these hadnt been  sent by text alert 
to his mother. Our adjudicator didnt  think NatWest had made an error because  Mrs B was 
granted authority to be informed about  account changes when she became a third party to 
his account and NatWest confirmed that customers are automatically  enrolled to receive 
account activity  alerts  when they provide a valid mobile number.
Mr B thinks  his mothers access  was restricting to writing cheques  and paying in cash  so he 
still doesnt think NatWest  should  have given  information about  him to his mother.  And 
NatWest hasnt provided a copy of the agreement to show  the terms on which she was 
appointed.
In response to Mr Bs further concerns our adjudicator explained  that:-
Mrs B has been a third party on his account since October 1990 and hed seen 
evidence of both of their signatures  on the account.
NatWest confirmed Mrs B has a third party mandate which allows  her to access all 
information on the account.
NatWest confirmed Mrs B has act now text alerts set up and NatWest automatically 
sets up activity alerts for any customer who has a mobile number registered with it.
NatWest had provided a sample  third party mandate and part of the form states: 
I/we understand that the third party may access all information  relevant to the 
account including personal information.
Although Mr B thinks Mrs B can only write  cheques and pay in cash, NatWest 
provided documents to show what third parties can and cannot do and these showed 
that she would also have permission to do other things such  as close  accounts,  
arrange new payments, cancel payments on the account and obtain any information 
relevant to an account they are named on.
Ref: DRN64384052Mr B disagrees with the adjudicators view.  Hed like to understand how NatWest told his 
mother about movements  on his account before she gave details of her mobile number   
because theres nothing to show it did this previously.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I must explain  at the outset that I cant make  a finding about  whether or not NatWest 
breached data protection laws when it sent text alerts to Mrs B about Mr Bs account. Thats  
a matter for the Information Commissioners Office, not this service.  I can, however, look at 
whether NatWest breached Mr Bs confidentiality  and whether it treated Mr B fairly  and I can 
look at the impact any mistake has had on Mr B.
Mr B confirmed to us that he gave his mother a power of attorney over his account a number 
of years ago. NatWests records show Mrs B was appointed as a third party over Mr Bs 
account in 1990. NatWest  hasnt been  able to provide a copy of third party authority due to 
lapse of time but in the circumstances I cant say this is unreasonable. Based on the 
information Ive seen Im satisfied that Mrs B is an authorised third party on Mr Bs account.
I now need to think about whether Mrs B was entitled to receive  the information. Ive 
explained above that NatWest hasnt been  able to provide the third party  authority that was 
signed at the time but it has provided a sample third party mandate  and standard NatWest 
documents to explain what  third parties  can and cant do. 
I think its more likely than not that Mrs B will have been appointed as a third party on 
NatWests standard  terms. I say this because it wouldnt be practical for NatWest  to manage 
accounts with third party access if its given very different instructions by each customer 
about what information a third party  appointed by them  can access. And I havent  seen  any 
information to support  Mr Bs view that his mother was only given restricted  access  to his 
account.
The third party mandate provided by NatWest requires the customer to sign to confirm  the 
following: I/we understand that the third party may access all information  relating to the 
account including personal information.
Based on this I think I think Mrs B was entitled  to receive information  from NatWest about 
Mr Bs account. And because Mrs B was entitled  to receive the information  I cant  say 
NatWest breached Mr Bs confidentiality  when it provided text alerts to his mother about the 
changes hed made to standing  orders on his account.
Mr B is concerned that he never  gave  permission for NatWest  to send text alerts  to his 
mothers mobile phone. And hes also concerned about whether  NatWest previously 
provided changes  about his account  to his mother before she was registered for text alerts.
Ive thought about Mr Bs concerns but I dont think  it matters  how NatWest chose to provide 
the information. NatWest  explained to us that it automatically sets up activity alerts for any 
customer who has a mobile  number registered with it and NatWests records show  that 
Mrs B registered for act now text alerts in 2018. Ive already  explained  above  why I think  
its more likely than not that Mr B appointed  his mother  as third party on the terms of 
Ref: DRN64384053NatWests standard  third party  mandate. This says that the third party may access all 
information relating  to the account  including personal information and it doesnt  in any way 
restrict the way in which NatWest is required to provide the information. It follows  that as 
Mrs B was entitled to receive the information  I dont think it matters how NatWest chose to 
provide information  to Mrs B about Mr Bs account.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 March  2020.
