The complaint
Mr C complains that Tandem Personal Loans Limited wont refund to him the money that he 
paid for some membership credits. His wife is also involved in his complaint and hes being 
represented by a claims management company.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint last month in which I described what had 
happened as follows:
Mr C had bought a trial membership of a holiday club from a holiday company in 
July 2006 and he upgraded to full membership of the club in July 2007. He upgraded 
his membership again in November 2008.
Mr C and his wife entered into a membership application agreement to trade in that 
membership and to buy 13,500 membership credits from the holiday company in 
April 2019. The membership price was £15,950 and Mr C also entered into a fixed 
sum loan agreement with a finance provider for a loan of that amount. He agreed to 
make 179 monthly repayments of £162.82 and a final payment of £162.42 to the 
finance provider.
Mr Cs representative, on Mr Cs behalf, made claims to the finance provider under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in July 2020. It said that: the 
product was misrepresented to Mr C and his wife; the contract between Mr C and his 
wife and the holiday company was breached; commission was paid between the 
finance provider and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr C which 
created a breach of fiduciary duty and an unfair relationship; and the loan agreement 
was unaffordable.
The finance provider didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so a 
complaint was made to this service. Mr Cs complaint form says that: the holiday 
company and the finance provider failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability 
to afford the loan; the finance provider paid a commission to the holiday company 
which wasnt declared to him and the holiday company unduly pressured him and his 
wife into entering into the membership application agreement and him into entering 
into the loan agreement; all rendering the loan agreement unfair pursuant to section 
140A.
Our investigator recommended that Mr Cs complaint should be upheld. He thought 
that the holiday company had misrepresented the credits as something that Mr C 
would benefit from by selling his credits - but he said that the evidence suggests that 
that couldnt have been the case. He said that Mr C paid for a product that he would 
otherwise not have purchased, if not for the misrepresentation. He didnt think that 
the finance provider properly assessed the claim under section 75 and he said that, 
had it done so, it would have upheld it and so it needed to take action to put things 
right.
He also thought it likely that a court would conclude that an unfairness has arisen 
and that it was possible that the loan may have been unaffordable for Mr C but he 
didnt consider those points any further because he was already upholding Mr Cs 
complaint. He recommended that the finance provider should: cancel the loan and 
refund all loan payments made (with interest); and refund any maintenance fees paid 
for the years in which the credits werent utilised (with interest).
Mr Cs loan was transferred to another finance provider in August 2022 and it asked 
for Mr Cs complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. It provided a detailed 
response to our investigators recommendations, including summaries of Mr Cs 
welcome call with the finance provider, and said that it had not found any evidence to 
support a conclusion of misrepresentation or unaffordable lending so it said that there 
can be no valid claim under sections 75 or 140A. Mr Cs loan was then transferred to 
Tandem Personal Loans.
Mr Cs representative, on behalf of Mr C, says that theres evidence to support that 
the credits were sold as an investment and it has provided information about resale 
listings, including an application form, and minutes of an annual members meeting, 
which it says demonstrate a resale value of the credits. It also says that the welcome 
call was undertaken prior to Mr C experiencing the monthly repayments from his 
limited funds, and that that, coupled with the annual maintenance obligations, the 
cost to potentially use the product and the absence of a return on the investment, 
make the loan unaffordable. It has also raised concerns about the way that the loan 
was sold to Mr C.
I said in my provisional decision: I consider that Mr Cs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr C and his wife entered into a membership application agreement in May 2019 
to trade in their existing membership and to buy 13,500 membership credits  
they also signed other documents including the terms and conditions, a standard 
information form, a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be 
given, and an initial disclosure document;
the membership fee was £15,950 and Mr C also electronically signed the loan 
agreement and confirmed that hed seen and read the pre-contract credit 
information and the loan explanation documents;
Mr Cs representative made claims to the finance provider in July 2020 and Mr C 
then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter referred to claims under 
sections 75 and 140A, including that the points were misrepresented to Mr C and 
his wife, but his complaint form only referred to a claim under section 140A and 
didnt refer to a misrepresentation made by the holiday company;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods 
or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that 
section are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, 
to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor 
and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Cs claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not the 
finance providers, and Tandem Personal Loans, responses to his claims were 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
the July 2020 letter said that the holiday company represented to Mr C and his wife that the credits were of some substance and that the purchase would be an 
investment as the credits would increase in value and, after a few years, they 
would be able to sell them at a considerable profit  but its now clear that the 
credits are worthless and have no merit;
Mr C has described the way that the credits were sold to him and his wife  he 
says that they were looking to sell their existing membership but were told that 
because it was for low season weeks it would be impossible to sell so the credits 
were explained to them  they could be swapped for luxury holidays all over the 
world, for cruises, country manor stays in England, luxury power boats trips and 
power cars  and he says after two years they could sell a proportion of the 
points back, so they thought that they could carry on taking nice holidays and still 
get a proportion of their money back;
the standard information form that they signed says that the credits:  can be 
exchanged for rights of occupation and use in a unit of accommodation or a yacht 
or use of other lifestyle products such as luxury cars at various locations ; and: 
The Resale Facility for [credits] will be available to be applied for as of the year 
2024 and cannot be relied upon as the basis for entering into a Membership. 
Resale values or timeframes cannot be guaranteed and are subject to offer and 
demand;
the finance provider says that all prospective purchasers attend a compliance 
interview with a compliance manager where every aspect of their purchase is 
explained to them before signing the documentation;
the finance provider made a welcome call to Mr C after hed entered into the loan 
and a transcript of that call has been provided which shows that Mr C said: It 
was the deal that did it for me, because we were looking to sell our existing 
scheme and the fact that they changed it to this new points scheme where we 
could actually sell some and keep some. That was what we were after. The 
family can use it as well so we are not limited to one week a year we can chop 
and change, it is so much more flexible so thats why we liked it;
I consider that the credits do have some substance as they can be exchanged for 
rights of occupation and use in a unit of accommodation or a yacht or use of 
other lifestyle products such as luxury cars, and Im not persuaded that theyre 
worthless;
Mr C has provided a handwritten note which he says were the notes that the 
sales reps used to explain the benefits that could be had from buying the credits 
and there was a breakdown of costs to justify the membership fees but I dont 
consider that those notes show that the holiday company sold the credits to Mr C 
and his wife as an investment and Ive seen no written documentation that refers 
to the credits as an investment or to a guaranteed increase in value or profit;
it was clear from the standard information form that the resale facility would be 
available to be applied for from 2024 (which was five years after Mr C and his 
wife entered into the membership application agreement) but the resale value 
wasnt guaranteed;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday 
company sold the credits to Mr C and his wife as an investment - nor am I 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the credits were 
misrepresented to Mr C and his wife by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the membership application agreement by any such 
misrepresentations;
the July 2020 letter also says that the holiday company has stopped trading so has committed a repudiatory breach of contract - the finance provider said that a 
new management company has been appointed and was able to fully service Mr 
C and his wifes membership in accordance with the terms and conditions of their 
agreement - I consider that the liquidation of the holiday company would be a 
breach of contract for which Tandem Personal Loans would now be liable under 
section 75 - but I also consider the appointment of the new management 
company to have been a suitable remedy for that breach of contract, and Ive 
seen no evidence to show that Mr C and his wifes use of their credits has been 
adversely impacted by the liquidation of the holiday company and Im not 
persuaded that they would be entitled to terminate the membership application 
agreement in these circumstances;
Mr C says that he and his wife tried to book holidays but were unable to book the 
holidays that they wanted as there was never any availability and that they did 
book a couple of city breaks but due to the Government imposed restrictions in 
response to the pandemic they were unable to take advantage of them  and he 
says that theyve now terminated their agreement with the holiday company;
but the finance providers response to our investigators recommendation said 
that it wasnt aware that Mr C and his wifes agreement had been terminated and 
the agreement included payment of the annual membership renewal fees until 
2025  it also says that outside of the government imposed restrictions on travel, 
Mr C and his wife have been able to book holidays as they wished but have 
chosen not to do so;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been any 
breach of the membership application agreement for which Tandem Personal 
Loans would now be liable under section 75;
Mr Cs representative says that commission was paid between the finance 
provider and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr C which created 
a breach of fiduciary duty and an unfair relationship but the finance provider said 
that there was no commission arrangement between it and the holiday company;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that the finance provider paid a 
commission to the holiday company or to show what commission, if any, was 
paid by the finance provider to the holiday company and Im not persuaded that 
theres been a breach of any fiduciary duty by the finance provider in these 
circumstances;
Mr Cs representative says that the loan agreement was unaffordable for Mr C 
and Mr Cs complaint form says that the holiday company and the finance 
provider failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan;
the finance provider says that Mr Cs loan application was underwritten subject to 
its lending criteria at the time which would have included validation of information 
on the application form and a check against a number of databases, including 
credit reference agencies, before arriving at the decision to approve the lending;
the finance provider has provided evidence to show that it assessed the 
affordability of the loan for Mr C and that Mr C was retired with investment 
income of £3,000 each month and that it obtained information from him about his 
expenditure and credit commitments  and it says that it used that information to 
calculate that he had a monthly disposal income of £1,029.74;
Mr C has provided copies of his bank account statements for the period from 
January to June 2019 but I dont consider that those statements show that the 
loan wasnt affordable for him in April 2019 when it was made to him;Mr C said in the welcome call that the loan was affordable for him and that: For 
the first two years the payments are fine and then in the third year I expect to pay 
it off all in one go once my pension comes through so I dont think it is going to be 
a problem;
he has provided information about the redundancy payment that he received in 
November 2018 which he said would have comfortably lasted until his 60th 
birthday when he could draw on his pension  and he also provided information 
about the lump sum payment and annual pension that he would be receiving;
Mr Cs representative says the monthly repayments coupled with the annual 
maintenance obligations, cost to potentially use the product and the absence of a 
return on the investment, make the loan unaffordable  but the membership 
application agreement said that the annual membership renewal fee was 
included from 2020 until 2025;
Tandem Personal Loans has provided information to show that Mr C has 
continued to make the loan repayments and Mr C says that hes been advised to 
keep making the loan repayments until a decision is made on his complaint;
I consider that the checks that were conducted by the finance provider were 
reasonable and proportionate and I dont consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect the finance provider to have made more detailed checks about the 
affordability of the loan for Mr C and I find that it was fair and reasonable for it to 
conclude on the basis of the checks that it made that a loan with a monthly 
payment of £162.82 was affordable for Mr C;
even if Im wrong about that and those checks werent reasonable or 
proportionate, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
loan wasnt affordable for Mr C in April 2019 when it was made to him and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan was mis-sold to Mr 
C, that the finance provider shouldnt have made the loan to him or that it has 
acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr C about the loan;
Mr Cs complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured Mr C and 
his wife into entering into the membership application agreement and Mr C into 
entering into the loan agreement;
Mr C and his wife had signed the separate standard from of the withdrawal notice 
that could be given to withdraw from the membership application agreement 
within 14 calendar days without giving any reason, so if they were concerned 
about the way that the credits had been sold to them and didnt want to buy them, 
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted the 
holiday company within the withdrawal period to withdraw from the membership 
application agreement but Ive seen no evidence to show that they did so;
the loan agreement that Mr C electronically signed clearly set out his right to 
withdraw from the loan agreement without giving any reason within 14 days, so if 
Mr C was concerned about the way that the loan had been sold to him, I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect him to have contacted the finance provider 
within the withdrawal period to withdraw from the loan agreement but Ive seen 
no evidence to show that he did so;
Mr C said in the welcome call that he was definitely given enough time to read 
the terms and conditions and that: Rather than a hard sell we could go away and 
read the deal and the plan [and] discuss it with our daughter who is in finance so 
we were quite confident about it; and he also said that he would recommend the 
holiday company to a family member;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr C and his wife 
were unduly pressured into entering into the membership application agreement, 
that Mr C was unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the 
holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Cs relationship 
with the finance provider was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr C and the 
finance provider in these circumstances;
the finance provider didnt issue a substantive response to Mr Cs claims so I 
cant say that its response to his claims was fair or reasonable  but if it had 
properly responded to his claims I consider that it would have been fair and 
reasonable for it not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mr C for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership credits, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Tandem Personal Loans to refund to him any of 
the money that hes paid under the loan agreement, to cancel the loan 
agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response 
to his complaint.
Subject to subject to any further comments or evidence that I received from any of Mr C, his 
representative and Tandem Personal Loans, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend 
to uphold this complaint. Tandem Personal Loans says it has no further points to make but 
Mr C has provided a statement in response to my provisional decision. In that statement he 
says, in summary, that: 
the credits were sold to him on the basis that half could be sold or rented back to the 
holiday company within two years, so should be construed as an investment, whilst 
still retaining the other half to use for services  but the resales never materialised so 
he never got a chance to make any money from his investment;
the credits were also sold to him on the basis of flexibility of use of the services but 
there was never availability of the hotels or services that he tried to book and it would 
appear that the holiday company had oversold the credits;
the credits seemed like the best investment to make as the holiday company told him 
that his timeshare option with it wouldnt sell because he owned winter months and in 
a couple of years he could sell off a portion of the credits and use the money to pay 
off the loan for the initial purchase and the holiday company made it sound like a 
good selffunding investment; and
he's left with a loan that hes continuing to pay but has nothing at the end of it except 
a very bad experience and a huge lump sum missing from his pension, all because 
the credits were misrepresented by to him by the holiday company.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not persuaded that I should change the findings that I set out in my 
provisional decision. Mr C and his wife had signed the standard information form which says 
that: The Resale Facility for [credits] will be available to be applied for as of the year 2024 
and cannot be relied upon as the basis for entering into a Membership. Resale values or 
timeframes cannot be guaranteed and are subject to offer and demand; and Ive seen no 
evidence to support Mr Cs claim that any of the credits could be sold or rented back to the 
holiday company within two years. 
Ive carefully considered all of the information that Mr C and his representative have 
provided, including Mr Cs statement in response to my provisional decision and, although I 
sympathise with him for the issues that he and his wife have had with their membership 
credits, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the credits were sold to 
them as an investment or that the credits were misrepresented to them.
Mr C says that he's left with a loan that hes continuing to pay but has nothing at the end of it 
except a very bad experience and a huge lump sum missing from his pension. He also says 
that he and his wife have terminated their agreement with the holiday company but the 
finance provider said that it wasnt aware that Mr C and his wifes agreement had been 
terminated. I suggest that Mr C contacts the holiday company to check whether his and his 
wifes agreement has been terminated and, if it hasnt, they may be able to use their credits. 
But Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of 
contract by the holiday company for which Tandem Personal Loans would now be liable 
under section 75.
For the reasons set out in my provisional decision, I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable 
in these circumstances for me to require Tandem Personal Loans to refund to Mr C any of 
the money that hes paid under the loan agreement, to cancel the loan agreement, to pay 
him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 December 2023.
