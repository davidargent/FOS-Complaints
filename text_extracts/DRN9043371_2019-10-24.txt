K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited, trading as Sunny, lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.  
background
Mr G took out 47 instalment loans with Sunny between February 2015 and May 2018.  The 
loans ranged from £50 to £800. At the outset, loans one to four were repayable in 24, weekly  
repayments and loans six to 47 were repayable in six, monthly repayments. Mr G repaid all the 
loans. A summary  of Mr Gs borrowing  from Sunny is shown as an appendix to this decision.
Mr G says that he had a gambling  problem and that the loans from Sunny made his position 
worse. He wants a refund  of interest  and information about the loans removed from his credit file. 
One of our adjudicators assessed  Mr Gs complaint. He said that Sunny shouldnt have 
given Mr G loans six to 47. He set out what Sunny should do to put matters  right.  
Mr G accepted the adjudicators view but Sunny didnt. It said:
Mr G had to use a small % of his monthly  income  for the contractual repayments. 
The loans were  affordable. 
There was no pattern  of lending which suggested that Mr G was reliant  on the loans. 
Mr G repaid loans early.
It doesnt think  that the loans were unsuitable.  
Sunny offered to compensate Mr G in relation to loans 25 onwards. Mr G didnt accept  
Sunnys offer.  So, as there was no agreement between the parties,  Mr Gs complaint was 
passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN90433712the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr G could  sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. Of 
course, the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a consumer 
could sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. 
This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook  (CONC) defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
I dont think that Sunny  was wrong  to give Mr G loans one to four. Given the repayment 
amounts, what was apparent about Mr Gs circumstances at the time and his history with the 
lender at that point, I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for Sunny to ask Mr G for the 
amount of information  needed to show the lending was unsustainable. There wasnt  anything  
in the information Mr G provided or the information  Sunny  shouldve  been aware of, which 
meant it wouldve  been proportionate for Sunny to start verifying what Mr G said about  his 
finances at that stage.  
In relation to loan five, I think Sunny shouldve taken steps to build a more  detailed picture of 
Mr Gs financial  situation. But, based  on what  Ive seen, I dont think Sunny wouldve  known  
that Mr G wouldnt have  been able to sustainably  make  the repayments  he needed to make  
for loan five. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Mr Gs lending history  with Sunny, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
six. I say this because  by loans six, Mr Gs overall  pattern of borrowing suggested he had 
become persistently reliant on short-term loans.  Whilst the amounts Mr G borrowed varied, 
by loan six, he had taken out six loans  in almost ten months. In many instances from loan six 
onwards, Mr G was provided  with a new loan either within a short period of settling a 
previous one or before hed repaid a previous loan. By loan six, Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not that Mr Gs indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr G wasnt making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  47 was taken  out 
three years and three  months  after Mr Gs first loan with Sunny. And it was for a larger 
amount. Mr G had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over 
an extended period.
Ref: DRN90433713I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because these loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness  by 
allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time. And the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative  implications  on Mr Gs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so was likely to have  kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, I dont think that Sunny  should have given Mr G loans six to 47 and Sunny should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund all interest  and charges Mr G  paid on loans six to 47;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans  taken from loan six onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries  about loans  six to 47 should be removed from Mr Gs 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Gs complaint  in part. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr G compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 November  2019.
