DRN-1461822
The complaint
Mr A says Canada Square Operations Limited (trading as Egg) mis-sold him a payment 
protection insurance (PPI) policy.  
What happened
Mr A bought the policy in 2000 at the same time as taking out a credit card by an internet 
application.  
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Mr A disagreed with our adjudicators view, so 
the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr As case.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr As complaint because:
I think Canada Square Operations made Mr A aware on his internet application form 
that he had a choice about buying the PPI, and that he chose to take it. 
Canada Square Operations didnt recommend the PPI to Mr A so it didnt have to 
check if it was right for him. 
Its possible the information Canada Square Operations gave Mr A about the PPI 
wasnt as clear as it shouldve been. But Mr A doesnt appear to have been affected 
by any of the main things the policy didnt cover  and based on what I know about 
his circumstances it looks like the policy couldve been useful to him. So I dont think 
better information wouldve stopped him buying it. 
 
Ive taken into account Mr As comments, including what he said about his sick pay benefits 
from his employer. But this point doesnt change my conclusion
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 May 2020.
