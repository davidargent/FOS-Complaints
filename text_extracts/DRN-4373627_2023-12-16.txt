The complaint
Mr G complains about a sum of money that BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited 
(BMWFS) is seeking payment of from him.
What happened
In July 2021 Mr G entered into a hire purchase agreement with BMWFS for a new car 
costing £44,447.20. Under the terms of the agreement, everything else being equal, Mr G 
undertook to make an advance payment of £500 followed by 47 monthly payments of 
£619.80 followed by 1 monthly payment of £18,410.33 making a total repayable of 
£48,040.93 at an APR of 2.9%.
On 26 April 2022 BMWFS sent Mr G a default notice.
On 20 May 2022 BMWFS sent Mr G a termination notice.
On 6 July 2022, following a complaint made by Mr G, BMWFS sent Mr G a final response 
letter (FRL). Under cover of this FRL BMWFS said it was satisfied that it had nothing wrong 
in issuing a default notice and then a termination notice.
On 14 February 2023 the car was recovered from Mr G.
On 11 April 2023 BMWFS contacted Mr G to say that having sold the car at auction he owed 
it £4,431.90 repayable within 14 days.
On 16 April 2023 Mr G emailed BMWFS to say that he understood he could discuss a 
repayment plan for the sum of £4,431.90 it was seeking the payment of from him.
On 19 April 2023 BMWFS contacted Mr G to say that he owed it £6,881.53 (£4,431.90 plus 
a settlement rebate reversal of £2,449.63).
On 17 May 2023, following a complaint made by Mr G, BMWFS sent Mr G a FRL. Under 
cover of this FRL BMWFS said it was satisfied that it had done nothing wrong in seeking 
payment of £6,881.53 from him.
Unhappy with BMWFS FRL Mr G complained to our service.
Mr Gs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
BMWFS should only seek payment of £4,431.90 from Mr G (not £6,881.53), that it should 
pay Mr G £250 for the distress and inconvenience it had caused him and that it should 
ensure anything recorded with credit reference agencies in respect of the agreement reflects 
(from 11 April 2023) an outstanding sum of £4,431.90 and not £6,881.53.
BMWFS didnt respond to the investigators view and Mr G responded to say that he felt he 
should be paid more than £250 in compensation.
Because BMWFS didnt respond to the investigators view and Mr G responded to say that 
he felt he should be paid more than £250 in compensation Mr Gs complaint has been 
passed to me for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would first like to acknowledge that Im very aware that Ive summarised the circumstances 
surrounding this complaint in far less detail than the parties and Ive done so using my own 
words. Im not going to respond to every single point made by all the parties involved. No 
discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on what I think are the key issues 
here. Our rules allow me to do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as 
a free alternative to the courts. If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive 
ignored it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual argument to be 
able to reach what I think is the right outcome.
Secondly, and for the avoidance of any doubt, Im only considering in this decision Mr Gs 
compliant about the sum BMWFS is seeking payment of from him after his car was 
recovered and sold at auction. In other words, Im not considering any other compliant Mr G 
might have against BMWFS.
Prior to the investigator issuing her view on this case BMWF advised our service that if Mr G 
had called it within 14 days of its letter dated 11 April 2023 it would have capped the sum it 
was seeking the recovery of from him at £4,431.90 and wouldnt have increased it to 
£6,881.53.
Now I accept that Mr G might not have called BMWFS within 14 days of its 11 April 2023 
letter. But Im satisfied that he contacted it by email within 14 days confirming, or at least 
suggesting, his acceptance of the debt of £4,431.90 and to say that he would like to agree a 
repayment plan. And because of this, Im satisfied that its only fair that BMWFS reduces the 
sum its seeking the recovery of from Mr G to £4,431.90.
But Im also satisfied that that that BMWFS should reduce the sum its seeking the recovery 
of from Mr G to £4,431.90 for the following reasons:
BMWFS has had the benefit of the sale proceeds of the car
Mr G was in, and is still in as I understand it, financial difficulties
FCA guidance is clear that customers that are in default or in arrears difficulties 
should be treated with forbearance and due consideration by businesses
treating the sale proceeds as an early repayment and applying an early and non-
reversable settlement rebate shows in my view forbearance and due consideration 
and constitutes a fair and reasonable thing for BMWFS to have to do in the particular 
circumstances of this case
Like the investigator Im also satisfied that BMWFS handing of matters in this case has been 
poor and has caused Mr G a degree of distress and inconvenience for which he should be 
fairly and reasonably compensated for. But having considered everything the parties have 
said and submitted I can confirm that Im satisfied that £250 constitutes an appropriate sum 
to be paid by BMWFS in this respect.
My final decision
My final decision is that BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited must:reduce the sum its seeking the recovery of from Mr G to £4,431.90*
pay Mr G £250 for the distress and inconvenience this whole matter has caused him 
and for the avoidance of doubt this sum should be paid to Mr G directly and not used 
to reduce the sum of £4,431.90
ensure anything it has recorded with credit reference agencies in respect of the sum 
being sought from Mr G shows a capital sum being sought of £4,431.90 and not a 
higher sum
*I would politely remind BMW Financial Services(GB) Limiteds of its obligations, if Mr G is in financial 
difficulties, to act with forbearance and due consideration in its collection  going forward  of this sum 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 January 2024.
