The complaint
Ms W complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Debenhams unfairly cancelled her policy in 
October 2021. 
What happened
Ms W says that NewDay cancelled her policy in October 2021 which she thinks is unfair. As 
a result, she says she has been financially disadvantaged. She would like her PPI policy re-
instated. NewDay says it gave notice of the cancellation as per the terms and conditions of 
the policy, and so it hasnt done anything wrong by cancelling the PPI. 
Our adjudicator considered this complaint and felt that Ms Ws complaint should not be 
upheld. Ms W disagreed so the complaint has been passed to me to consider. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms W says that it wasnt fair for NewDay to cancel her policy and she would like it reinstated. 
Unfortunately, due to the length of time thats now passed the policy terms and conditions for 
Ms Ws PPI policy are no longer available. But NewDay have provided a copy of a PPI terms 
and conditions document which it says is the closest available and wouldve been the same 
if not very similar to the terms and conditions which applied to Ms Ws policy. And in the 
absence of the actual document, this is the best evidence available.
In section 6 of the document provided under the heading How Does Cover End? it states:
After the first 30 days, your cover may be cancelled by you or us by giving 30 days notice in 
writing 
NewDay wrote to Ms W on 16 August 2021 informing her that the PPI would be cancelled  
by them on 31 October 2021. As this was more than 30 days notice, I am satisfied that 
NewDay fulfilled their obligation to give Ms W notice of their right to cancel the PPI policy. 
As Ive not seen any other evidence that NewDay should not have cancelled the policy, or 
did not follow the correct cancellation procedure, I think NewDay need to reinstate Ms Ws 
policy.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I do not uphold Ms Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 November 2022.
