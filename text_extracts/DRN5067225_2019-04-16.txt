K820x#14complaint
Mrs G complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) withheld her funds.
background
Mrs G is represented by a relative in bringing  her complaint. But, for ease  of reading, Ill refer 
to all submissions as having been  made by her directly.
In June 2018, PayPal placed  a limitation on Mrs Gs account and a hold on her funds. They 
said that she was in breach of their Acceptable Use Policy  and chose to end their 
relationship with her. They said they would hold the funds in her account  for 180 days  before 
releasing them to her.
Mrs G contacted PayPal  on the 180th day and asked them to release the funds. But PayPal 
didnt do so for around two more weeks. Mrs G was unhappy with PayPals  decision  to end 
their relationship and that they had taken longer than 180 days  to release her funds. She 
asked this service to look into the issue.
Our investigator thought that PayPal  had acted in line with their terms and conditions. In 
relation to the time it took to release Mrs Gs funds, PayPal explained that a second 
limitation had been  placed  on her account, meaning  that a manual review was needed 
before the funds  could be released.  This took the time frame  over 180 days.  
Our investigator thought PayPal had acted  fairly.  But Mrs G didnt agree. She said that would 
mean PayPal could simply impose a further  limitation on customers accounts which would 
allow them to hold on to their funds indefinitely. Mrs G asked for her complaint to be 
reviewed by an ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Within her complaint  to this service, Mrs G hasnt disputed that she breached the Acceptable 
Use Policy or that PayPal were entitled to hold her funds  for 180 days.  So the only issue Im 
looking at here is whether  PayPal were entitled  to hold the funds for longer than 180 days.  I 
think they were and Ill explain why below. 
By using  PayPals services, Mrs G agreed to be bound by their User Agreement. She 
therefore agreed not to breach the agreement, including the Acceptable Use Policy. 
Where a customer has breached the User  Agreement, clause 10.2(a)  says that PayPal  may 
(amongst other things) limit their right to use their account, which may in turn suspend or 
limit their ability to make  withdrawals. PayPal sent Mrs G an email in June 2018 explaining 
why they were permanently limiting  her account. They  were  entitled to do this because  of 
Mrs Gs breach of the Acceptable Use Policy.
The email  said they could hold the funds in her account for up to 180 days. PayPal say that 
their system would usually release the funds automatically after 180 days.  But that didnt 
happen here because of a second limitation  which was placed on Mrs Gs account in 
September 2018. That meant the automatic  release function was disabled.
Ref: DRN50672252Under clause 10.2(b), because Mrs G had breached the User Agreement, PayPal were  
entitled to hold any funds including, without limitation, for more than 180 days  if so required 
by PayPal.
PayPal say that the second limitation  was put in place after their compliance team received a 
Suspicious Activity Report  about  payments received into Mrs Gs account. They  say that this 
type of limitation  requires  a manual review by the compliance department before  funds  can 
be released.
PayPal say they didnt notify  Mrs G of the second  limitation because  she had already been 
told that her account  had been permanently limited.  But they say they spoke to her on the 
phone in October 2018. Mrs G asked  when her funds would be released and was told the 
180 days would end on 16 December 2018.  PayPal say that Mrs G called them  on 16 
December and the agent she spoke  to raised  a request for the funds  that day and sent it to 
the compliance department for review.  The request  was reviewed on 2 January 2019 and 
the funds were released to Mrs G that same  day. 
I think PayPal could  have  gone further in the October phone call and told Mrs G about the 
second limitation and the effect  it would  have on the funds being  released. But Im satisfied 
that they were  acting  in line with their User Agreement when they held the funds for more  
than 180 days. Thats because their procedures  required them to carry out a manual review  
before the funds  could be released.  And they have  confirmed  that, when such  a review is 
necessary, it can only be carried out after 180 days have passed. They say that, under their 
procedures, if the request  for the review had been  made earlier (for example, after the call in 
October 2018) it would most likely have been closed off without being  actioned.  
I asked PayPal why the request wasnt reviewed until 2 January when it had been made on 
16 December. They said that the number of requests submitted on a daily basis  is quite 
substantial and that its not possible to prioritise one over another  because  they work on a 
queue-based system.  I think thats a reasonable explanation. And Ive taken into account the 
fact that it took 17 days from the request for the manual review to be completed and the 
funds released. I dont think thats an unreasonable amount of time in the circumstances 
here.
So I dont  think PayPal  have acted unfairly  and I wont  be asking them to do anything.
my final decision
For the reasons  above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 May 2019.
