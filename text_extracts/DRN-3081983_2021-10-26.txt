The complaint
Mr and Mrs O complained because National Westminster Bank Plc closed their accounts.
What happened
On 24 July 2020, NatWest decided to close the joint and sole accounts held by Mr and Mrs 
O, without giving notice.
Mr and Mrs O complained. Mr O said he wasnt able to open an alternative account 
elsewhere, because his medical condition meant he was shielding during the Covid 
pandemic, so he couldnt go in person to open an account.
In its final response letter, NatWest said it didnt uphold Mr and Mrs Os complaint. It had 
taken a commercial decision to close the accounts. Under the terms and conditions of the 
accounts, NatWest didnt have to provide a reason.
Mr and Mrs O werent satisfied and complained to this service. They said that some direct 
debits had failed, and theyd incurred Â£22 in charges. They also said theyd had NatWest 
accounts for years  and hadnt applied for a joint account in June 2020, which they thought 
had influenced NatWests decision. 
Mr and Mrs O said NatWest hadnt been helpful, and had told them it couldnt discuss the 
reasons. This had caused them anxiety and upset, and theyd had to borrow money from 
friends. Both Mr and Mrs O had savings or current accounts with other financial businesses.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr and Mrs Os complaint. He said there had been  
applications for new accounts on 12 June and 23 June. NatWest had looked into the 
application, but had found that some information hadnt been disclosed, and this was why it 
had decided to close Mr and Mrs Os existing accounts.
The investigator recognised that Mr O had said they hadnt made an account application, but 
he said the security information, including passports, driving licences and signatures for both 
Mr and Mrs O, persuaded him that these had been genuine applications.
The investigator explained that banks can close accounts at any time, provided it does so in 
line with the terms and conditions. And section 12.2 of NatWests terms and conditions said 
it can close any account immediately if it reasonably suspects that its been given false 
information. So the investigator considered NatWest hadnt acted unfairly.
Mr and Mrs O didnt agree. Mr O said the June application had been made to another bank, 
and then said hed opened a savings account with NatWest, on the advice of a branch 
employee. He said that as NatWest staff had recommended opening a savings account, it 
was the banks fault. The investigator told Mr O that the account had been closed because 
Mr O hadnt disclosed some information  and not because hed opened a savings account. 
Mr and Mrs O asked for an ombudsman decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Section 12.2 of the terms and conditions of Mr and Mrs Os existing NatWest accounts set 
out a range of circumstances which mean the bank can close accounts without giving notice. 
Having looked at the information provided by the bank, I consider that NatWest acted within 
the terms and conditions when it decided to end its banking relationship with Mr and Mrs O.
Banks dont have to give a specific reason when they close accounts under these provisions. 
But, as Mr and Mrs O are now aware, NatWests reasons for closing the account here were 
linked to applications made for accounts in their name. The information presented by 
NatWest does persuade me that it was more likely than not, on balance of the evidence 
here, that they made these applications. 
So Ive considered all the information here impartially and Im satisfied that NatWest acted 
fairly, within the terms and conditions of the account in taking the actions it did  for the 
reasons it did. In these circumstances, customers sometimes find it useful to check 
information such as the anti-fraud database CIFAS for any markers against either of their 
names.
Finally, I note that Mr O said that the reason hed opened a savings account with NatWest 
was that a NatWest branch employee had strongly advised him to do this  so this meant the 
bank was at fault. I confirm that the reason why NatWest closed Mr and Mrs Os accounts 
was not because they opened a savings account.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs O to 
accept or reject my decision before 23 November 2021.
