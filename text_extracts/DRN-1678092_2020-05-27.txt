The complaint
Mr Y has complained about the loans he took out with Provident Personal Credit Limited 
trading as Satsuma Loans. He says the loans were unaffordable.
 What happened
Mr Y took 13 loans from Satsuma between February 2014 and July 2019. Some of the 
information Satsuma provided is summarised below.

13 09/07/2019 Outstanding 12 £900.00 £348.60Our adjudicator upheld loan 4 and loans 10-13. Satsuma made an offer in line with the 
adjudicators recommendations. Mr Y did not agree. He said he was in a bad position 
financially. He says he fell into arrears on several of these loans and was issued with default 
notices  so Satsuma should not have continued to lend to him.
I issued my provisional decision on 11 May 2020 explaining why I was thinking of upholding 
loans 8 and 9 as well as loan 4 and loans 10-13. I also explained why I wasn't considering 
upholding loans 1-3 and loans 5-7.
Satsuma did not provide any further comments or evidence. Mr Y responded to my 
provisional decision. He asked me to reconsider loans 6 and 7. He said both loans 6 and 7 
were taken out on the same day or the very next day after the previous loan was settled. He 
also said at the time he took loan 7 he did have other short term lending outstanding.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice.
Having done so, my decision remains the same. For completeness, I have set my 
provisional decision out below and addressed Mr Y's comments within it to form my final 
decision.
Satsuma needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out reasonable checks to understand whether 
Mr Y could repay his loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure.
So I would expect an assessment of creditworthiness to vary with circumstance. In general, 
Id expect a lender to require more assurance, the greater the potential risk to the consumer 
of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. With this in mind, in the early 
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.
But I might think a lender might need to do more if, for example, the consumers income was 
low or the amount lent or monthly repayment was high. And the longer the lending 
relationship goes on, the greater the risk of it becoming unsustainable and the borrower 
experiencing financial difficulty. So Id expect a lender to be able to show that it hasnt 
continued to provide loans to a customer irresponsibly.
Satsuma says it agreed loans 1-3 and 5-9 after Mr Y provided details of his monthly income 
and expenditure. This information didnt suggest that Mr Y wouldnt be able to make the 
repayment he was committing to. And in these circumstances, Satsuma felt it wasnt 
irresponsible to lend.
Loans 1 and 2
The information provided by Satsuma does suggest that Mr Y was asked to declare details 
of his monthly income, along with a breakdown of his monthly expenses. Given the 
repayments  the loans appeared affordable based on the information Mr Y declared to 
Satsuma.I accept that Mr Ys actual circumstances werent reflected in the information he provided. 
But, in the absence of anything to suggest that it was likely to be unreliable, Satsuma was 
entitled to rely on the information Mr Y provided. I dont think there was any reason for 
Satsuma to doubt the information Mr Y gave it. The repayments that Mr Y agreed to make 
on his loans were relatively modest compared to the monthly income that he declared to 
Satsuma.
And, even after allowing for his regular monthly expenditure and other borrowing, Im 
satisfied that the repayments would have appeared to be easily affordable for Mr Y.
So given these repayment amounts, what was apparent about Mr Ys circumstances at the 
time, and his lack of borrowing history with Satsuma, I dont think it wouldve been 
proportionate for Satsuma to ask him for the amount of information that would be needed to 
show the lending was unsustainable. So, I dont think Satsuma was wrong to give loans 1-2.
Loan 3
As well as the information Mr Y declared about his income and expenses for loan 3, 
Satsuma also had a small repayment history at this point. I can see Mr Y missed payments 
on loan 2 in June and July 2014. Satsumas contact notes indicate that this was due to Mr 
Ys card being blocked. I dont think this on its own was enough at this stage to have alerted 
Satsuma to any concerns when it agreed loan 3. So I don't think Satsuma was wrong to give 
loan 3 either.
Mr Y missed payments during loan 3 - although again the reasoning on each occasion did 
not seem to specifically indicate Mr Y was having affordability issues (rather it was due to the 
collection timing, change in payment dates etc). It may have been reasonable for Satsuma to 
have carried out more in-depth checks before agreeing loan 4, but as it has already agreed 
to make an offer on loan 4, I havent considered this further.
Loan 5, 6 and 7
There was a declined application shortly after loan 4 ended but then there was almost an 
eight-month gap between that declined application and when loan 5 was agreed. I dont think 
it was unreasonable for Satsuma to have considered Mr Ys position had recovered in the 7-
8 months that has passed by. So, I think it reasonable for the level of checks to be less 
(rather than more) thorough. On this basis, I think the checks Satsuma did were enough and 
the information Mr Y declared about his income and expenses suggested the loan 
repayments were affordable. So, I dont think Satsuma did anything wrong when it agreed 
this loan either.
Loan 5 was repaid in accordance with the schedule up until its early settlement. I accept 
loans 6 and 7 were taken very shortly after the previous loan was repaid but I dont think that 
Satsuma ought to have concluded that the pattern of lending had, in itself, become 
demonstrably unsustainable or harmful  such that I could reasonably say that the facts 
spoke for themselves by loan 6 or loan 7. I say this because the lending relationship had 
effectively started again at loan 5. Loan 5 was preceded by a long gap in lending and it was 
reasonable for Satsuma to treat Mr Y as a new borrower given that gap. Loan 5 was repaid 
without any repayment issues. So, although Mr Y returned the same day for loan 6 (and it 
was a for a larger amount), I still dont think Satsuma was wrong to agree loan 6.   
During loan 6, Mr Y missed a payment on 10 September 2015 but two days later Mr Y 
caught up with this payment and also made an over payment covering the next two weeks. 
He explained to Satsuma he missed the payment because he had not transferred the money 
across from his savings account. Mr Y then missed the next four weekly payments before settling the loan early explaining that he moved to a new house and had more important 
things to pay for.
Mr Y then applied for loan 7, the day after loan 6 was repaid. Bearing in mind the history of 
repayment issues Mr Y now had, I think Satsuma should have enhanced its checks to also 
ask Mr Y specifically about any other short term lending he had outstanding, as well as 
asking about details of his income and expenditure. I dont think it needed to fully review and 
verify his actual financial situation at this point.
Mr Y has provided us with his bank statements and credit file  so Ive looked at these to see 
what other short-term lending was outstanding at the time he applied for loan 7. In my 
provisional decision I said I could see Mr Y had repaid two short term loans the previous day 
but Mr Y says he did have a loan outstanding at the time. 
Having reviewed these again, I can see a credit from a short-term lender on 28 September 
2015 for £300 and it looks like this was repayable over two payments of around £205 - as 
debits were made to the same lender on 28 October 2015 and 27 November 2015. So, I 
agree this loan was outstanding at the time of Mr Ys application for loan 7. 
However, I would normally uphold a complaint where there were significant levels of other 
short term lending and I dont think one loan with this level of repayment was significant. If 
Satsuma had taken this into account, along with the income and expenses declared (£1,700 
and £1,168), then I still think it would have considered the repayment of £121 on loan 7 
affordable. So, Im not upholding Mr Ys complaint about loan 7.
As I said in my provisional decision, I dont think at this point Satsuma needed to fully verify 
the information Mr Y declared, so I dont think it would have discovered Mr Ys actual 
financial position at this point. I think Satsuma was right to be concerned after loan 7 was 
repaid as it seems it was when declined Mr Ys application a couple of days after loan 7 was 
repaid.
Loans 8 and 9
Loan 7 was repaid  although again there were a number of repayment issues during its 
term. Whilst there was an 18-month gap in lending before loan 8, there were 6 declined loan 
applications during this time. I think given this and the history that was emerging with the 
various repayment issues Mr Y was having, it would have been prudent for Satsuma to fully 
review and verify Mr Ys actual financial position before agreeing  loan 8. If it had, it would 
have discovered that Mr Y had at least 4 other short terms loans with other lenders. The 
position was similar for loan 9. And as a responsible lender, Satsuma would have been 
concerned that Mr Y wasn't in a position to sustainably repay loans 8 and 9. So, Im 
upholding Mr Ys complaint about loans 8 and 9 as well as loan 4 and loans 10 to 13.
Putting things right
Satsuma shouldnt have agreed loan 4 and loans 8 to 13 and should put things right as set 
out below:.
A. Satsuma should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr Y towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B. Satsuma should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr Y 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr Y originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.C. Satsuma should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any 
upheld outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr Y as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr Y having made 
overpayments, then Satsuma should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. Satsuma should hen refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr Y. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then Satsuma should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr Y.
E. Satsuma should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Mr Ys credit file in 
relation to loan 4 and loans 8 to 11. The overall pattern of Mr Ys borrowing for loans 12 
onward means any information recorded about them is adverse, so Satsuma should remove 
these loans entirely from Mr Ys credit file.
Satsuma do not have to remove any outstanding loans from Mr Ys credit file until these 
have been repaid, but Satsuma should still remove any adverse information recorded about 
these loans.
*HMRC requires Satsuma to take off tax from this interest. If Mr Y asks Satsuma for 
a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off, Satsuma should provide this. If Satsuma 
intends to use the refund to reduce an amount Mr Y owes, Satsuma must do this after tax.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold Mr Ys complaint as Ive explained above and in 
my provisional decision. I require Provident Personal Credit Limited trading as Satsuma 
Loans to put things right for Mr Y as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 June 2020.
