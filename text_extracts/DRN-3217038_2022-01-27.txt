The complaint
Mr B and Miss G complain about the early repayment charge they had to pay National 
Westminster Bank Plc when they redeemed their mortgage. 
What happened
In around December 2018 Mr B and Miss G took out a capital and interest repayment 
mortgage with NatWest for around £130,995 over a term of 35 years. They approached 
National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) in March 2021 about porting their mortgage to a 
new property. NatWest gave them a decision in principle (DIP). Based on the DIP, they paid 
estate agents up front to market their property, found a house to buy and instructed solicitors 
to deal with the conveyancing.
When Mr B and Miss G made their formal mortgage application, NatWest wouldnt offer 
them a mortgage as they couldnt show 12 months work history.
Mr B and Miss G were unhappy because NatWest had told them, before issuing the DIP, 
theyd only need to evidence six months employment and a further three months in place. 
Theyd expected NatWest to lend them the amount in the DIP and had progressed their 
move, and incurred costs, based on that expectation.
Mr B and Miss G complained to NatWest and asked them to waive the early repayment 
charge (ERC) on their mortgage so they could go to another lender to avoid wasting the fees 
theyd incurred. NatWest acknowledged their mistake and offered £150 compensation for the 
inconvenience theyd caused Mr B and Miss G by giving them wrong information. But 
NatWest wouldnt waive the ERC as theyd redeemed their NatWest mortgage knowing the 
ERC was payable. Mr B and Miss G want NatWest to refund the ERC.
Our investigator thought NatWests offer of £150 compensation was fair to put things right. 
Since Mr B and Miss G didnt agree, Ive reviewed everything afresh to come to a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest acknowledge their adviser gave Mr B and Miss G incorrect information about the 
evidence theyd need to provide about their work history when they spoke to them in mid-
March 2021. And a DIP was issued following that conversation.
A DIP is an indication of what a lender may be prepared to lend to a borrower, subject to 
carrying out further checks. The DIP issued to Mr B and Miss G made clear that, based on 
the information theyd provided, NatWest may be able to lend them up to £249,000 subject 
to, amongst other things, them completing a full mortgage application, which would include 
checking their income and expenditure; a full credit check; and satisfaction of NatWests 
lending criteria at the time they made their application. The DIP set out in bold type that the 
amount was only an indication and was not a formal commitment to lend. 
Even if the adviser had given correct information about the work history evidence NatWest 
would need, the status of the DIP would have been the same. I think Mr B and Miss G 
should reasonably have understood from the DIP that, until theyd been through the 
application process, there was no guarantee theyd be able to borrow the amount set out in 
the DIP. 
I acknowledge the mortgage adviser raised their expectations theyd be able to get the 
borrowing they needed from NatWest. And I can understand it was disappointing when 
NatWest didnt offer them a mortgage. But they went ahead and incurred the costs of 
moving, before they had a formal mortgage offer in place, at their own risk. 
Under the terms and conditions of Mr B and Miss Gs mortgage with NatWest, they were 
able to port their mortgage  or more specifically the fixed interest rate product they agreed 
when they took out the mortgage  provided they met NatWests lending criteria when they 
applied to port. Since they didnt meet those criteria, and werent able to port the mortgage, 
the ERC became payable if they redeemed it. The terms of the mortgage were clear about 
that.
I understand Mr B and Miss G had to consider whether to lose the moving costs theyd 
incurred by pulling out of the sale and purchase, or going ahead with another lender, 
redeeming the mortgage with NatWest and paying the ERC. Ive explained why I think 
incurring the moving costs based on the DIP was at their own risk. And Mr B and Miss G 
knew, when they decided to go ahead and redeem the NatWest mortgage in September 
2021, that they would have to pay the ERC. So, whilst I understand they had a difficult 
choice to make, I dont think its fair to ask NatWest to refund the ERC to Mr B and Miss G.
NatWest recognised the inconvenience Mr B and Miss G were caused by the incorrect 
information they were given when the DIP was issued. They apologised and paid them £150 
compensation for that. Bearing everything in mind, I think that was fair and reasonable. So, 
whilst I understand it will be disappointing for Mr B and Miss G, I think NatWest did enough 
to put things right and I dont uphold their complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr B and Miss Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B and Miss G 
to accept or reject my decision before 24 February 2022.
