The complaint
Mr S complained that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA denied his Buyer Protection claim. He 
said he hadnt received their updates or information requests and their systems werent fit for 
purpose.
What happened
Mr G completed a purchase through an online shopping site in April 2020. He paid for the 
item using his PayPal account.
In July 2020, the item developed a fault, so Mr G contacted the seller direct. The seller told 
Mr G to return the faulty item for a refund using recorded delivery. But Mr G didnt have 
previous experience of returning an item for a refund. So, he contacted PayPal seeking their 
guidance and support. Mr G opened a dispute and claim and requested a refund through 
PayPal.
Mr G says that PayPal agreed to contact the seller and told him to wait until theyd received 
the sellers response. Despite logging into his PayPal account on several occasions, Mr G 
says he received no further updates.
On 26 July 2020, Mr G checked his PayPal account. It showed that his dispute had been 
closed in favour of the seller. So, he contacted PayPal. They said hed failed to provide 
tracking information for the item returned. But Mr G told them that they hadnt asked for this 
and hed had no further contact from them.
Mr G decided to raise a complaint with PayPal. His call was transferred to their complaints 
department, but he received a message that their office was closed. So, he called PayPal 
again who agreed to speak with their disputes team to appeal the decision.
Mr G says he contacted PayPal a further four times up to 18 August 2020. He repeated his 
concerns and stressed that PayPal had never told him to return the item or provide tracking 
details. Mr G tried to raise a complaint with PayPal using their online system but says he 
wasnt able to complete their complaint process.
Mr G decided to refer his complaint to this service. He wanted PayPal to refund the amount 
hed paid for the item.  He also wanted them to acknowledge that their systems werent fit for 
purpose and make changes to improve it going forward.
One of our investigators looked into the circumstances of Mr Gs complaint. He didnt think 
that PayPal needed to take any further action and believed that theyd acted reasonably. But 
Mr G didnt agree with our investigator. So, he asked for his complaint to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr G had purchased an item that developed a fault within about 3 months of receipt. So, he 
contacted the seller. I understand that the seller agreed to provide a refund, but Mr G wasnt 
comfortable completing the return without PayPals support. I can understand why Mr G did 
that here. Using PayPal as an intermediary under their buyer protection scheme would, 
ordinarily, provide some piece of mind.
PayPal have provided details of their Buyer Protection scheme. This information is also 
available on their website. It may apply where either an item is not received from a seller or 
the item is Significantly Not as Described (SNAD). SNAD can include where an item is 
unusable in its received state and was not disclosed as such. In Mr Gs case, the item was 
found to be faulty. 
PayPals user agreement says that any dispute must be opened within 180 days of the date 
payment was made. In Mr Gs case, the purchase was completed on 5 April 2020. So, 
PayPals requirement was met here. 
When a dispute is opened, PayPals agreement suggests that a direct conversation between 
the purchaser and seller may help to resolve the dispute. Mr G had already spoken to the 
seller whod agreed to refund subject to returning the item with recorded delivery. But Mr G 
chose not to do that here. So, he escalated his dispute to a claim. This is normally used 
where the buyer and seller are unable to reach an agreement. 
PayPals agreement goes on to say that the buyer  Mr G here  should respond to PayPals 
requests for documentation or other information. It also says that he should comply with 
PayPals shipping requests in a timely manner. It goes on to say that PayPal will make a 
final decision based upon these requirements and requests.
Mr G says, having escalated his dispute to a claim, he received no further information or 
requests from PayPal. This included any request to return the item and provide tracking 
information. He says that he regularly checked his online PayPal account for any messages 
and requests.
Our investigator contacted PayPal to establish what had happened. PayPal provided full 
details and copies of their account records and notes. These include copies of 
communications sent to Mr G in relation to his claim. In particular:
11 July 2020  Confirmation that a message had been sent to the seller.
14 July 2020  Confirmation that the seller had agreed to provide a refund and 
requested Mr G return the item.
15 July 2020  Various communications confirming the dispute had been escalated 
to a claim also advising that more information may be required, and Mr G needed to 
respond within requested timescales. PayPal also confirmed the seller had agreed 
a full refund once the item had been returned. It then gave details of how to return 
the item and how to upload the tracking information to PayPals Resolution Centre.
18 July 2020  PayPal chased the information theyd requested (i.e. shipment and 
tracking details).
22 July 2020  PayPal chased again for the information requested.
25 July 2020  PayPal confirmed that the claim had been denied as they hadnt 
received the information previously requested.
Mr G says that he didnt received any of these messages. 
PayPal told this service, to allow customers sufficient notification of our requests during the 
claims process, we send emails directly to their email address and not through the message 
centre. PayPal have provided evidence to confirm that these messages were sent to Mr Gs 
email account. The email address matches that provided to this service by Mr G.
Ive looked at the help pages on PayPals website in relation to disputes and claims. Under 
the page, How do I escalate a dispute to a claim? it includes, Well email you to let you know we received your claim and well continue to email you with updates and any action or 
information needed by you. 
Ive also looked at the page, How do I provide additional information or evidence to help 
resolve a dispute or claim? It includes, If youve received an email asking for more 
information, about your dispute or claim, you can upload that to the Resolution Centre.
So, it appears that PayPal did comply with their website information and guidance by 
emailing Mr G with updates. But Mr G told this service, I was not monitoring my email 
account and did not have tobecause I was logging on to my PayPal account. In the 
circumstances, I can understand why Mr G didnt receive PayPals updates. But I cant 
reasonably hold PayPal responsible for that. They followed the guidance and process laid 
down on their website pages and customer guidance.
Mr G believes that PayPals systems and processes are not fit for purpose. Its not the role of 
this service to decide upon the appropriateness of PayPals processes and procedures. Only 
that theyve been applied fairly and reasonably in Mr Gs circumstances at the time. I realise 
that Mr G will be disappointed, but I believe that PayPal have acted in line with what their 
website guidance says. So, I cant reasonably say that PayPal have acted unfairly here.
Mr G has also referred to problems using PayPals online complaint system. He says that 
the instructions provided to him didnt work. The handling of complaints is not a regulated 
activity within the context of this services role. So, Im unable to consider this aspect 
separately. But PayPal have confirmed they emailed Mr G on 12 August 2020 with details of 
how to complain. They also confirmed that Mr G registered a complaint on 22 August 2020 
and PayPal issued their response to him on 29 September 2020. 
In order to reassure Mr G, I did take the opportunity to visit PayPals website personally, to 
see if a complaint could be raised in a straight forward manner. I was able to start the 
process through the Contact us  Messages option and selecting the appropriate complaint 
drop-down option. 
Unfortunately, PayPal have confirmed that its now too late to resurrect Mr Gs claim. I fully 
appreciate that Mr G believes that had communications been sent through his PayPal 
account, his claim may have been successful. But I dont think PayPal did anything wrong in 
following the processes they did. The processes are clearly detailed on their website.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 September 2021.
