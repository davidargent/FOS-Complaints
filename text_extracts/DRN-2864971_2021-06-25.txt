The complaint
Ms M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc branch staff refused to let her make a 
withdrawal from her account. Ms M also complains about the service NatWest provided 
when she attended the branch and that it decided to close her account.
 
What happened
Ms M visited NatWests branch as she wanted to withdraw £5,000 to pay for a kitchen. 
NatWests branch staff said Ms M didnt have the required identification so the withdrawal 
couldnt take place. Ms M has told us she found the branch staff rude and threatening during 
her visit.
Ms M returned to the branch the following day and asked to withdraw £8,000 in cash. Ms M 
had identification with her but after NatWest asked further questions about why she needed 
the funds it decided not to authorise the withdrawal. Ms M has told us she found NatWests 
staff to be rude and threatening. NatWest says Ms M was abusive towards its branch staff so 
the manager took the decision to close her accounts. 
NatWest went on to send Ms M notification her accounts would be closed. Ms M complained 
but NatWest didnt agree any errors had been made. 
Ms M referred her complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They 
thought NatWest had dealt with the complaint fairly and didnt ask it to do anything else. Ms 
M didnt accept the investigators view so her complaint has been passed to me to make a 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear that Ms Ms branch visits were distressing for the parties involved. Ms M has told us 
she wanted to withdraw funds from her account to pay for a kitchen before the price 
increased. Ms M has explained she found branch staff to be rude, unhelpful and threatening. 
NatWest says it couldnt approve the initial £5,000 withdrawal because Ms M didnt have the 
required identification. And when Ms M returned the following day with identification she 
asked to withdraw £8,000 which led to further questions and the decision to decline the 
request. NatWest says Ms M was abusive towards branch staff which is why it took the 
decision to close her account.
I dont doubt that matters became heated in branch. Ms M has told us she wanted the funds 
to pay for a kitchen and I appreciate it was her money. But NatWest says for large cash 
withdrawals it needs identification to proceed. So I dont agree NatWest made an error when 
it declined the withdrawal on Ms Ms first visit.
NatWests branch manager has provided a statement explaining he wanted to ensure Ms M 
returned with the correct identification so asked her what documents were available. And Ms 
M has told us that she took a wrong turn when trying to find the exit which led to the branch 
manager telling her to go a different way. Whilst I can see matters were strained, I dont think 
NatWest acted unfairly by asking Ms M to return with identification. 
When Ms M returned the following day she did have identification. But Ms M asked to 
withdraw a substantially larger amount of money, so NatWest asked some additional 
questions. Again, I appreciate Ms M was asking to withdraw her money. But NatWest has to 
ensure it protects its customers funds from fraud or scams and I think it was reasonable for it 
to make further enquiries when the withdrawal amount increased overnight. NatWests 
branch staff say Ms M provided inconsistent responses so the decision to decline the 
withdrawal was taken. Whilst I understand this was upsetting for Ms M, Im satisfied NatWest 
is able to decline a withdrawal request in the circumstances raised. Im sorry to disappoint 
Ms M but I dont agree NatWest acted unfairly when it refused to approve the withdrawal. 
Both Ms M and NatWest say the other partys behaviour was unreasonable. Its clear 
matters became very heated and Ms M took the step of contacting the Police when NatWest 
declined the withdrawal. But Im not persuaded NatWest acted unfairly in this case. Whilst I 
dont doubt that tempers were raised, I think that reflects the situation as a whole rather than 
a deliberate attempt by branch staff to threaten or intimidate Ms M. I havent found 
NatWests branch staff treated Ms M unfairly in this case. 
NatWest says that its banking relationship with Ms M had broken down so it took the 
decision to close her account. Whilst I understand this meant Ms M had to move her banking 
arrangements elsewhere, NatWests terms and conditions allow it to close an account by 
giving notice to the customer. Im satisfied NatWest followed the correct process when 
closing Ms Ms account. 
Im sorry to disappoint Ms M as I can see how strongly she feels in this matter. But, for the 
reasons Ive set out above, I havent found that NatWest treated Ms M unfairly when she 
attempted to make a withdrawal in branch. And I havent been persuaded the decision to 
close Ms Ms account was unreasonable. As Im satisfied NatWest dealt with Ms Ms 
complaint fairly, Im not telling it to take any further action. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 July 2021.
