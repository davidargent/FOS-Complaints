K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
BMW Financial Services (GB) Limited,  trading as Alphera Financial Services,  wasnt of 
satisfactory quality.
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
the car was supplied  to Mr G under  a hire purchase agreement with Alphera  
Financial Services that he signed in November  2017;
Alphera Financial  Services,  as the supplier  of the car, was responsible for ensuring 
that it was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr G - whether or not it was 
of satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number  of factors,  including the 
age and mileage  of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr G was about three and a half years old, had been  
driven for 22,000 miles and had a price of £37,994;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within  
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly  how long 
that time is will depend on a number of factors;
the cars  gearbox  was replaced in January 2019   about 14 months  after the car had 
been supplied  to Mr G and, in that time,  hed driven it for about 7,000 miles  and the 
invoice for the repair says: dropped gearbox  and confirmed internal damage beyond  
repair and car requires whole new gearbox;
a manufacturers dealer supplied the parts for the replacement  gearbox but Mr G had 
to pay it £1,274 for the labour costs and he claimed reimbursement of that from 
Alphera Financial  Services;  
the investigator recommended that Alphera  Financial Services  should refund that 
amount to Mr G but it said that he willingly entered into an agreement  for a used car 
that was nearly  four years  old so there  was a possibility of issues arising and the 
gearbox issue arose over a year later;
I dont consider that its reasonable to except a car that cost £37,994,  was less than 
five years old and had only been driven  for 29,316 miles  to need to have its gearbox 
replaced and I consider it to be more likely than not that the car wasnt as durable as 
it was reasonable  for Mr G to expect it to be  and for that reason that it wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to him; and
Ref: DRN66747432I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Alphera 
Financial Services to pay £1,274  to Mr G to reimburse him for the amount that he 
paid for the cars gearbox to be replaced.  
 
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I uphold Mr Gs complaint and I order BMW Financial 
Services (GB) Limited, trading as Alphera Financial Services, to pay him £1,274 to 
reimburse him for the amount that he paid for the cars gearbox to be replaced.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 July 2020.
