The complaint
Mrs Bs representative has complained, on her behalf, about a pension sum of £65,000
which was lost during the process of transferring it from her self invested personal pension
(SIPP) plan with IPS Pension Limited, trading as James Hay Partnership, to Cofunds
Limited, trading as Aegon.
The delays in locating her pension funds meant that a significant amount of her pension
assets was left in cash until it was transferred to a new SIPP provider in May 2021.
What happened
Mrs Bs SIPP provider, James Hay, received an instruction to transfer £65,000 from Mrs Bs
SIPP to her Aegon General Investment Account (GIA) on 10 December 2020. This was for a
further contribution to an existing investment, for which required James Hay was required to
countersign. James Hay then sent this payment to Aegon on 16 December 2020. However,
Aegon said James Hay hadnt provided the correct forms, and so the payment would be
returned on 31 December 2020.
Unfortunately, this didnt happen. Mrs Bs representative contacted Aegon in January 2021
and was told the money had been returned to James Hay due to an incorrect reference
number. The representative then raised a complaint with James Hay on 22 January 2021
about this missing money.
James Hay contacted Aegon on 26 January 2021 and was told the money had been
returned as Aegon had been unable to match the reference number. James Hay then
attempted to locate the money on its own systems, as it believed the money had been
returned to it.
On 19 February 2021, James Hay received a transfer form, requesting that Mrs Bs entire
SIPP be transferred to Standard Life. James Hay emailed Mrs Bs representative on 26
February 2021 requesting an instruction to trade form, in addition to any application forms
Aegon may require. However, James Hay used an incorrect email address to contact Mrs
Bs representative. As a result, this request for information wasnt picked up.
Mrs Bs representative then contacted James Hay on 8 March 2021 to enquire about the
missing £65,000 and the status of the transfer. These issues were escalated, the correct
email address was provided, and the request sent again on 9 March 2021. James Hays
banking team also confirmed that it had investigated and could find no evidence that the
£65,000 had been returned to it by Aegon.
The necessary information to continue with the transfer was then sent to James Hay on 12
March 2021. This was then sent to Aegon to move all the funds into the SIPP bank account
on 17 March 2021.
James Hay had also contacted Aegon on 16 March 2021 to request evidence that the
£65,000 had been returned to it. Aegon said its system didnt show any record of the money
being returned, but that it would investigate further. On 17 March 2021, it emailed saying the
money had been returned to James Hay on 31 December 2020.
On 26 March 2021, James Hay received £454,383 which was placed into the SIPP bank
account. However, as it hadnt yet received the £65,000, it couldnt complete the requested
full cash transfer. On 4 April 2021, Aegon then confirmed it had located the £65,000 which
was still with it. It explained it had been placed under a different plan number. It confirmed on
12 April 2021 that the £65,000 had been placed into Mrs Bs GIA.
Although James Hay had sent the full disinvestment instruction on 17 March 2021, Aegon
said a new instruction would be required to disinvest the £65,000. James Hay questioned
this and asked if the recent instruction could be used, but Aegon confirmed on 23 April 2021
that the new instruction would be required. However, James Hay didnt let Mrs Bs
representative know about this requirement until 12 May 2021, when James Hay sent it the
application forms.
The completed forms were received on 14 May 2021 and were sent to Aegon on 24 May
2021.
On 25 May 2021, James Hay executed a partial transfer to Standard Life of the £545,089
which was already available. The disinvestment of the remaining amount was completed and
£64,998 was received on 1 June 2021. The money was then transferred on 4 June 2021.
Mrs B complained to Aegon and it issued its final response on 28 September 2022. It
maintained that it had returned the £65,000 to James Hay on 31 December 2020 and only
received it back on 9 April 2021. As a result, it couldnt identify any mistakes that it had
made.
As Mrs B wasnt satisfied with the response, the complaint was referred to our service for an
independent review.
Aegon has since provided its payment history records, and it appears the money was sent to
an account with AJ Bell on 31 December 2020 rather than James Hay. The money was then
returned to Aegon on 18 January 2021.
On 31 January 2021, Aegons technical team had contacted to its third parties team to
question the returned payment. On 1 February 2021, the technical team added a note to say
the payment should be returned, but it still showed AJ Bells bank details rather than James
Hays. The payment was then returned again on 17 February 2021.
A further request was raised to return the money on 2 March 2021, but again, it used the
details for AJ Bell. On 8 March 2021, Mrs Bs representative chased James Hay again about
the missing £65,000. Its banking team confirmed it had investigated and could find no
evidence the £65,000 had been returned to it. On 16 March 2021, James Hay requested
evidence from Aegon that the money had been returned. Aegon then reconfirmed to James
Hay on 17 March 2021 that the money had been returned to it.On 24 March 2021, the payment was returned to Aegon again. As set out above, Aegon
then confirmed to James Hay in early April 2021 to say that it had located the £65,000. On 9
April 2021, the technical team noted that it could process the payment this time as it had
located the wrapper number - and it was added onto the wrapper later that day. Aegon
confirmed to James Hay on 12 April 2021 that it had invested the £65,000 into Mrs Bs GIA.
Since the complaint has been referred to this service, Aegon has again reviewed the
complaint and realised that it had provided its complaint handler with incorrect information,
and that it confirmed that it hadnt returned the money to James Hay as it had previously
said.
The complaint was referred to me, as Im considering the connected complaint which
has been made to James Hay, which also relates to the delays incurred.
At my request, the investigator enquired further of James Hay as to why it was able to
partially transfer the SIPP on 25 May 2021, with the £65,000 then being received a few days
later, and therefore why it wouldnt have been able to do so earlier in the absence of the
£65,000. In response, its said that its able to complete partial transfers providing certain
requirements are met. And in this instance, as Mrs Bs SIPP was fully crystallised, with
numerous tranches, it was able to complete a partial transfer for the full value of one of the
tranches.
But it also said that it was unable to initiate a transfer to a new provider, and therefore it was
incumbent upon the receiving scheme, customer or their appointed representative to initiate
such a transfer  including a partial transfer  as set out in the plans terms and conditions.
The full transfer request which was submitted in February 2021 couldnt be completed as the
£65,000 was missing.
It further confirmed that there was a telephone conversation with Mrs Bs representative on 7
May 2021 in which the possibility of a partial transfer was discussed, but James Hay couldnt
act on the basis of a phone call. It did then agree to accept the partial transfer instruction via
email, and this was received on 12 May 2021, but this wasnt actioned until 25 May 2021.
I issued a provisional decision on the matter on 15 March 2023, in which I set out my 
reasons for upholding the complaint. The below is an extract from that decision.
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My current view is that there have been errors and delays incurred both by James Hay and
Aegon in this matter. And I agree with Mrs Bs representative that she shouldnt bear the
consequences of the combined effect of these.
I think the primary problem, and the issue from which other problems  albeit not all -
stemmed, was the loss of the £65,000 by Aegon. Aegon has itself now confirmed that it
didnt return these funds to James Hay on 31 December 2020, and that it didnt in fact locate
and then invest the funds in the GIA until 12 April 2021.
As such, I think its clear that Aegon is responsible for some of the delays in the investment
of the £65,000. But there were other delays for which I dont think Aegon was responsible,
and Im setting out my view on this below.
The missing £65,000  from 18 December 2020 until reinvestment in the new SIPP
Before the £65,000 was lost, James Hay initially provided the wrong forms, which led to
Aegon trying to return the funds on 31 December 2020.On the basis that the £65,000 was sent to Aegon on 16 December 2020, and it ought
reasonably to have been able to invest this in the GIA, had the correct forms been provided,
two working days later, there was a total delay in investing the £65,000 from 18 December
2020 up to 12 April 2021, the date that it was invested in the Aegon GIA.
The £65,000 was then returned to James Hay as cash on 25 May 2021. But it should have
been invested in the GIA from 18 December 2021 up to 12 April 2021, and been benefitting
from whatever investment return was experienced during that time.
Therefore, my view is that, to compensate Mrs B fairly, Aegon should determine whether,
had the £65,000 been invested in the GIA from 18 December 2020 up to 12 April 2021, the
notional value at that date would have been higher than £65,000.
If it wouldnt have been, there is no overall loss, and so neither James Hay nor Aegon would
need to compensate Mrs B for the loss of investment of the £65,000 in the period from 18
December 2020 up to 12 April 2021.
But if the amount as at 12 April 2021 would have been higher, then there was a loss, which
then needs to be apportioned between James Hay and Aegon.
Aegon should in that instance determine as to whether there was an increase or decrease in
the notional value of the GIA investment for its initial delay period from 18 December up to
31 December 2020, for which I think James Hay is responsible. If there was a notional
reduction in value, then the entirety of any loss thereafter up to 12 April 2021 should be
borne by Aegon.
If there would have an increase in value for that period, and then there would have been a
further increase in the value of the £65,000 investment from 31 December 2020 to 12 April
2021, then James Hay will be responsible for whatever notional increase in value would
have been achieved within that initial delay period up to 31 December 2020, with Aegon
being responsible for the increase in value thereafter.
And so Aegon should determine how much of the notional increase in value as at 12 April
2021 it would have been responsible for as a result of notional investment for the period from
31 December 2020 to 12 April 2021.
If there was a notional increase in the value of the £65,000 from 18 December 2020 to 31
December 2020 but a subsequent decline in the value from 31 December 2020 to 12 April
2021, then Aegon will bear no responsibility for any of the loss to Mrs B  the entirety of the
loss would have been caused by the initial delay period and lie with James Hay.
The amount of gain/loss to Mrs B on the £65,000, and if the latter, what percentage of loss
would be attributable to each business, would then have been established as at 12 April
2021. If the amount resulting from notional investment on 16 December 2020 would have
been higher, then Ill call this amount value (A).
From this point onwards, Aegons liability for the delays relating to the lost £65,000 ceased,
but the effect of its share of the loss on the current value of Mrs Bs SIPP persisted (see
below).
As set out above, Aegon confirmed on 23 April 2021 that a new instruction would be
required to disinvest the £65,000. However, James Hay didnt let Mrs Bs representative
know about this requirement until 12 May 2021, when James Hay sent it the new application
forms.The completed forms were received on 14 May 2021 and were sent to Aegon on 24 May
2021. James Hay received the disinvested amount on 1 June 2021 and transferred it out to
Mrs Bs new SIPP on 4 June 2021.
Had James Hay conveyed the need for the new disinvestment instruction to Mrs Bs
representative on 23 April 2021, it would reasonably have taken, allowing for the intervening
weekend, until 27 April 2021 for the forms to be received back by James Hay, and then sent
to and received by Aegon the day after  28 April 2021. Aegon then took six working days to
disinvest and transfer the funds across to James Hay, and so James Hay would have
received the funds on 6 May 2021. James Hay transferred the funds three working days
after it received them, and so they would have been transferred to the new SIPP provider on
11 May 2021.
Aegon should therefore provide James Hay with the value of (A) as established above, with
the addition of the actual investment returns it experienced between 12 April 2021 and 6
May 2021.
The redress which would need to be paid by both James Hay and Aegon is their respective
share of the total loss to Mrs B as a percentage, which then needs to be applied to the
current value of the amount represented by the transfer of the £65,000 into Mrs Bs new
SIPP.
So for example, if the £65,000 invested since 18 December 2020 would have been worth
£68,000 at 12 April 2021, and either Aegons or James Hays share of that loss is 70%, and
with actual investment returns applied up to when it should have been transferred out on 11
May 2021 (using the disinvestment date of 6 May 2021) taking that amount to £70,000, then
it would need to uplift the amount represented by the £65,000 transfer within Mrs Bs current
SIPP by a factor of 1.054.
But Aegon wasnt responsible for the delay between 11 May 2021 and 4 June 2021, and so
a separate calculation should be undertaken to determine the additional effect of the delay
incurred solely by James Hay. This would be to compare the loss attributable to Aegon
determined by a notional transfer on both 11 May 2021 and 4 June 2021. So in effect, a
further calculation as above, but on the basis of the later transfer date of 4 June 2021. If the
loss due to the notional earlier transfer on 11 May 2021 is higher, James Hay should pay as
a monetary amount, instead of Aegon, whatever the difference is between those two
calculations  with Aegon then paying the lower amount.
The effect on Mrs Bs SIPP should be neutral, but this will reflect the impact of the loss
caused by Aegon up to a notional transfer date of 11 May 2021, whilst not holding it
responsible for additional delays incurred by James Hay.
The retention of £454,383 in cash from 26 March 2021 until reinvestment in the new SIPP
James Hay was unable to comply with the initial full disinvestment request as it didnt have
the lost £65,000. As James Hay has confirmed, there was a telephone call on 7 May 2021
in which the possibility of the partial transfer was discussed, but James Hay couldnt act on
the basis of a phone call. It did then agree to accept the instruction via email, and this was
received on 12 May 2021, but this wasnt actioned until 25 May 2021.
But the full transfer was in any case impacted by the loss, investment, and subsequent
disinvestment of the £65,000. As Ive said above, Aegon had informed James Hay on 23
April 2021 that, following the relocation and investment of the £65,000, a new disinvestment
instruction would be required, but James Hay didnt confirm this to Mrs B s representative
until 12 May 2021. The forms were received back from Mrs Bs representative two days later
on 14 May 2021.Had the £65,000 been received by James Hay sooner, the whole of the amount could have
been transferred together at an earlier stage, with no need for a partial transfer. So for the
period from 28 March 2021, which is two days after James Hay received the bulk of the
amount to be held in cash, up to 11 May 2021, which is the soonest all of the funds could
have been transferred together, I think the responsibility for any loss lies with Aegon. The
funds couldnt have been transferred together before this point due to the loss of the
£65,000.
I appreciate that Aegon may assert that a partial transfer could have occurred before 11 May
2021, which would mitigate its liability for the bulk of the cash remaining uninvested after 26
March 2021. But this was a complicated and confused situation, caused in no small part by
the loss of the £65,000, and by the need for Mrs Bs representative to re-submit a partial
transfer request after it became aware that the full transfer request it had previously
submitted couldnt be processed by James Hay  directly due to the missing £65,000.
But for the period between 11 May 2021 and the actual date of transfer and reinvestment, I
think the responsibility for any loss lies with James Hay. If it hadnt caused delays in notifying
Mrs Bs representative of the need for a new transfer application form, and had actioned that
request promptly, and the disinvestment of the £65,000 had also taken place earlier, a full
transfer could have proceeded on 11 May 2021, with no need for the partial transfer.
As such, the same redress principle as that set out above should be applied to the amount
which was held in cash from 26 March 2021 onwards, but with Aegon being responsible for
the first delay period from 28 March 2021 to 11 May 2021 and then James Hay being
responsible for the period from 11 May 2021 to the date of reinvestment in the new SIPP.
If there is a loss attributable to Aegon from either part of the redress calculation as set out
above, Aegon should in the first instance pay into Mrs Bs SIPP to increase its value by the
total amount of the loss and any interest (as set out below). The amount paid should allow
for the effect of charges and any available tax relief. Compensation should not be paid into
the pension plan if it would conflict with any existing protection or allowance.
If Aegon is unable to pay the total amount into Mrs B's pension plan, it should pay that
amount direct to her. But had it been possible to pay into the plan, it would have provided a
taxable income. Therefore the total amount should be reduced to notionally allow for any
income tax that would otherwise have been paid. This is an adjustment to ensure the
compensation is a fair amount  it isnt a payment of tax to HMRC, so Mrs B wont be able to
reclaim any of the reduction after compensation is paid.
The notional allowance should be calculated using Mrs B's actual or expected marginal rate
of tax at her selected retirement age. I assume this to be basic rate. And so, assuming that
tax free cash would be taken, the reduction should be applied to 75% of the compensation,
resulting in an overall notional deduction of 15%.
Additional interest at the rate of 8% simple per year should be added to any loss from the
date of any final decision along these lines to settlement if the complaint isnt settled within
60 days of Aegon receiving notification of Mrs Bs acceptance.
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If Aegon deducts income tax from the
interest it should tell Mrs B how much has been taken off. Aegon should give Mrs B a tax
deduction certificate in respect of interest if Mrs B asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax
on interest from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
Mrs B has also unquestionably been significantly inconvenienced and distressed by thismatter. And whilst I appreciate that Aegon isnt responsible for some of the delays, the loss
of the £65,000 has been a significant contributory and complicating factor in the problems
Mrs B has faced here.
I think she will also be extremely frustrated to now learn that, despite Aegon previously
having maintained its position that it returned the £65,000 to James Hay in December 2020,
with the implications that this had for Mrs Bs complaint against that business, it has now
conceded that it didnt so after all  and that this has only come to light since the involvement
and further questions from this service.
As such, my current view is that Aegon should pay to Mrs B a further £300 in recognition of
this.
Mrs Bs representative accepted the proposed outcome. James Hay broadly did too, but 
wished to amend an aspect of my proposed timeline, saying that, once it had received the 
documentation to send to Aegon on 27 April 2021, it would have taken four working days to 
do so, and given the bank holiday, this would have been on 4 May 2021. And so, according 
to the remainder of the proposed timeline, this would mean that the transfer would have 
occurred on 17 May 2021 rather than 11 May 2021.
Mrs Bs representative has accepted that revised timeline.
Aegon also broadly accepted my findings, but pointed out that the instruction which 
accompanied the transfer of the £65,000 was to invest it in cash within the GIA, and so, it 
said, there would have been no loss for the time during which it had been lost.
I therefore asked the investigator to enquire further as to Mrs Bs understanding of what 
would happen with the £65,000 once it was invested in the GIA. Mrs Bs representative has 
said that the money would have been invested in the same way as her existing funds in the 
GIA  and that there would clearly have been no point in adding further money just for it to 
sit in cash.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My views on the matter remain broadly the same as those set out in the provisional decision, 
and for the same reasons. Ive noted Aegons point about the cash investment instruction, 
but I agree with Mrs Bs representative. There clearly would have been no point in adding 
funds to the account unless Mrs B intended to invest them. And in the absence of any 
evidence to persuade me otherwise, it seems more likely than not that the £65,000 would 
have been invested in the same way as Mrs Bs existing GIA funds. 
I think it was the fact that James Hay firstly issued the wrong forms, and then the 
subsequent loss of the £65,000 by Aegon, which prevented the funds from being invested 
as intended. And so I dont think the proposed redress methodology needs to be changed, 
other than as set out below. 
Putting things right
As with the provisional decision, my aim is to put Mrs B as closely as possible into the 
position she would have been, but for the mistakes made by both businesses. 
This hasnt been straightforward, and Im grateful to all parties for their swift communication on the amendments and outstanding issues which have needed to be addressed.
On the basis of the responses received, my view on the appropriate manner of putting things 
right remains as outlined in the provisional decision, but with an amended date of 17 May 
2021 for the soonest date that all the funds could have been transferred to the new 
provider. Further, the notional investment return on the £65,000 should be calculated on the 
assumption that Mrs B would have invested in the same funds, and proportions, as already 
existed within the GIA.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint and direct Cofunds Limited, trading as Aegon, 
to undertake the above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2023.
