The complaint
Mr S complains about being unable to use Barclays Bank UK PLCs branch service to pay a 
cheque in because it was too busy. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Barclays says that the days Mr S visited werent unusually busy. Barclays has also
said that the branch Mr S visited isn't big enough to hold a queue of around 24
customers.
I accept that as Mr S visited during the Black Friday sales it's likely there was a wait
to pay his cheque in. But I haven't been persuaded that Mr S was unreasonably
inconvenienced.
Mr S chose not to wait to deposit his cheque so had to make other arrangements.
Im satisfied Barclays has dealt with Mr S complaint fairly and I havent found
grounds to tell it to pay compensation or take any further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2020.
