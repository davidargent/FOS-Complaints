DRN-1861821
The complaint
Mr T complains that AWP Assistance UK Limited (trading as Allianz Assistance) is 
responsible for poor administration of a home emergency insurance policy.
What happened
Mr T had a policy that was due for renewal. He complained that Allianz told him his renewal 
premium would be £39.60 but it was actually £43.68. He also complained that Allianz agreed 
to send the renewal documents to his home address, but it didnt.
Allianz took the premium of £43.68 premium twice by mistake. Mr T made a further 
complaint about that.
Allianz wrote a final response letter dated 31 October 2019 but in November 2019 Mr T 
complained he hadnt received it and Allianz hadnt responded to his complaint as it 
shouldve.
In December 2019 Allianz offered Mr T £45.00. In January 2020 it sent him a cheque for that 
amount. It sent a second final response letter dated 29 January 2020.  Mr T brought his 
complaint to us in February 2020.
Our investigator said that Mr Ts complaint about the handling of his complaint falls outside 
our compulsory jurisdiction. He didnt think that it'd be reasonable to recommend an increase 
to the £45.00 compensation already paid to Mr T. 
Mr T disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. He says, in summary, that his complaint warrants further compensation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I accept that on 16 August 2019 Allianz told Mr T his premium would be £39.60, and he 
asked for documents to be sent to his home address rather than the insured address.
Allianz didnt send the renewal documents to his home address. So Mr T was put to the 
trouble of making a phone call on 11 September 2019 to chase up the documents. I can 
understand that he felt aggrieved when he found out the premium was actually £43.68, and 
Allianz hadnt noted his home address.
But Allianz said it would post the documents to his home address and Im satisfied that it did 
so.
Mr T had made a complaint on 11 September 2019. Allianz acknowledged that complaint. 
On 23 September 2019 it duplicated a payment of the £43.68 premium. So again I can 
understand that Mr T was aggrieved. And again Mr T was put to the trouble of making a 
phone call.  
But I dont think it was ever in doubt that Allianz would have to return the duplicated payment 
 which it did on 3 October 2019. So Mr T wasnt out of pocket for long. 
Whilst the shortcomings Ive identified caused Mr T some distress and inconvenience, Im 
satisfied that Allianzs payment of £45.00 was fair and reasonable compensation for this. 
So I agree with the investigator that we dont have power to consider Mr Ts further 
complaints about the way Allianz handled his complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont direct AWP Assistance UK 
Limited (trading as Allianz Assistance) to do any more in response to this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 October 2020.
