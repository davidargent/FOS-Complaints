An adjudicator considered  Mr Fs complaint  and recommended it be upheld  in respect of 
loans 3-5. QuickQuid  didnt agree  with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to 
decide. As theres been no further  dispute about loans 1-2, Ill only be considering  loans 3-5 
in my decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
In its initial  submissions to this Service, QuickQuid said:
We started implementing changes to affordability assessment in June 2014  and all the 
changes were completed by Feb 28th 2015. Starting [1st March  2015] before Mr [F] 
borrowed his first loan, QuickQuid had implemented an affordability review that is consistent 
with the [Financial Conduct Authority] FCA Handbook and that was in place at the time we 
received authorisation by the FCA. We confirm that this assessment was conducted properly 
and individually  for each of these  loans.
QuickQuid later responded to the adjudicators recommendations, saying:
In response  to [the Financial Ombudsman  Service] FOS assessment which recommends 
CashEuroNet UK [puts right] loans which were  funded after March 2015, we regret  to inform 
you that we cannot agree  to FOS recommendations.  Please note that in CashEuroNet UKs 
Ref: DRN19790412initial response to FOS we provided  detailed information indicating  why the loan(s) were  
responsibly lent to Mr [F]. Therefore we kindly ask that you move  this case  for ombudsman 
queue for a final decision.
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic  argument  directly and through 
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to address this point here,  though I have considered 
it alongside everything else in making  my decision.  
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  in 
how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Fs complaint and what  both parties have said 
about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr F borrowed  the loans in question.  Bearing  in mind 
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect  a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect QuickQuid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks:
the higher  the loan amount,
the lower the consumers income;  or
the longer  the lending relationship.
Ive considered the information QuickQuid provided about the checks it carried  out before 
lending to Mr F. For each of loans 3-5 it recorded his net monthly income  as £2,000.  It also 
recorded information about his total monthly  expenditure,  which  varied with each loan. 
Mr Fs total monthly expenditure was recorded  as follows:  £1,152 for loan 3, £1,350 for loan 
4 and £1,225 for loan 5. Included within  the total figures were  individual  figures for costs 
such as monthly credit  commitments and housing costs. QuickQuid also carried out credit 
checks but hasnt  shown us the full results of these.
Ref: DRN19790413A simple deduction of Mr Fs declared  expenditure from his declared income would leave  
him with monthly  disposable income of: £848  for loan 3, £650 for loan 4 and £775  for loan 5.
QuickQuid however made further  adjustments beyond this simple deduction for two of the 
loans. It says it estimated  Mr Fs monthly  disposable income was lower  than he declared for 
loans 3 and 5: £578 for loan 3 and £439  for loan 5.
QuickQuid hasnt explained or otherwise provided information about  how it calculated  its 
estimate of Mr Fs disposable  income, or why it made adjustments  in addition to what Mr F 
declared for loans 3 and 5 but not for loan 4. Without further  information,  Im unable  to say 
that QuickQuids  estimate of Mr Fs disposable income reflects  a proportionate check for 
loans 3-5.
In any event, I think QuickQuids checks needed  to go further than they did  for the 
following reasons.  Loans 3-5 were all taken out in relatively quick succession  and the 
amounts Mr F was borrowing were all significantly larger than his earlier loans. Ive noted the 
two month  gap between  loans  3 and 4 but I think this isnt particularly significant, especially 
as Mr F increased the amount he borrowed for loan 4 by almost  60%.  The largest  repayment  
on each of his loans was between approximately  43% and 69% of his net monthly income   
and each of these largest repayments exceeded Mr Fs monthly declared disposable income 
(which as Ive explained  above, was usually a larger amount than QuickQuid estimated). The 
increasing size of the loans and the nature  of the repeated borrowing suggest Mr F was 
struggling to settle  his loans in a way which  was sustainable. And taking into account the 
way the loans were  originally scheduled to be repaid  the total period of Mr Fs borrowing 
extends to about a year, so his need for credit doesnt seem to have been short-term.
Given the above, I think QuickQuid ought to have not only asked Mr F questions about  his 
income and expenditure but also required him to provide some form of proof of these things 
 such as payslips  and/or bank statements.
But even on the basis of the information  QuickQuid had, I think it ought to have realised 
loans 3-5 were not likely to be sustainably affordable  to Mr F. Based on Mr Fs own monthly  
disposable income declarations (which QuickQuid revised down for loans 3 and 5) he had 
disposable income of only £848  for loan 3  revised down to £578  by QuickQuid. Mr Fs 
highest repayment for loan 3 was £857,  which exceeds both Mr Fs declaration  and 
QuickQuids estimate for his monthly disposable  income. This means  the highest repayment  
was only affordable if Mr F could save income or otherwise have a surplus  to make the 
August 2017 payment. 
I dont think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid to lend on the basis  that Mr F was likely  to be 
able to do this. Ive noted that he repaid loans 1 and 2 early. But loan 3 commenced just 
three days after loan 2 was repaid  and was for more than double the amount of loan 2. 
Mr F repaid £784 to close loan 2 early  then immediately borrowed a similar amount. That 
Mr F borrowed an amount so similar  to what he repaid, immediately after paying it, doesnt  
suggest he was in a position to save income from month-to-month.
And having considered Mr Fs bank statements, I can see he repaid  two short-term loans in 
August 2017,  which totalled more than £1,000. So had QuickQuid carried out proportionate 
checks for loan 3, it wouldve likely confirmed that Mr F was borrowing from a number of 
other short-term lenders,  repaying them large  amounts and so was not likely to be in a 
position to save  to make payments in excess of its estimate of his monthly  disposable 
income. This would  mean Mr F wouldnt have been able to make  the largest payment when 
Ref: DRN19790414it fell due  something  QuickQuid was required to assess (as per CONC 5.2.1R  (2) which 
was in place at the time).
The situation  is the same, if not worse  given the size of the largest payments, for loan 4 and 
loan 5. Even when  using  the figures Mr F declared for monthly disposable income   £650 for 
loan 4 and £775 for loan 5  the highest repayments  of about £1,400 and £1,100  are 
significantly in excess of Mr Fs disposable  monthly income. Given  Mr Fs apparent  need  to 
access high-cost credit  so frequently,  I dont think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to think  
he would  be able to save money.
And had QuickQuid gone further and carried out proportionate checks, it wouldve likely 
confirmed the above. Mr Fs bank  statements  show he was borrowing from other  high-cost  
creditors to meet his repayments and/or other  living costs. At the time of loan 4 he was 
repaying other regular  creditors  over £1,000  a month and paying  short-term creditors almost  
as much.  Mr Fs credit  commitments were also very similar at the time of loan 5.
It doesnt make a difference to my findings, but its worth noting proportionate checks would 
also have likely revealed Mr F was spending  relatively large sums of money on gambling. 
Had QuickQuid seen  that Mr F was regularly  accessing high-cost credit because  gambling 
was contributing to him being unable  to settle  his debts  sustainably, I dont think it would (or 
should) have lent to him. 
In summary,  I think, based on the information QuickQuid had, it wasnt right for it to approve 
loans 3-5. And had it carried out proportionate  checks, this would  only likely have confirmed 
that Mr F wasnt  in a position  to be able to repay loans 3-5 in a way which  was sustainable 
for him.
putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr F paid on loans 3-4
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year from when the interest and charges 
were paid until the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  it recorded  about loans 3-5 from Mr Fs credit history 
HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Mr F a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
QuickQuid has said there  is still an outstanding  balance on loan 5. So QuickQuid must 
remove any interest and charges from loan 5 and treat any payments made as if they were 
payments towards  the principal. If this leaves a balance for Mr F to pay, QuickQuid may 
offset what it owes Mr F for loans  3 and 4 against this balance.  QuickQuid can only offset 
what it owes Mr F against the balance of loan 5 if it still owns  the debt. If Mr F has already 
paid more than the principal amount, QuickQuid  should refund any amount Mr F paid above 
£900, adding 8% simple  interest as described  above.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Fs complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC must put things right by taking  the steps set 
out above.
Ref: DRN19790415Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 April 2019.
