The complaint
Miss H has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed her account 
unfairly. She feels she was treated in a discriminatory way due to her race.
What happened
Miss H has said she visited NatWest branch and when she approached the counter she 
realised the member of staff serving her was someone she had complained about several 
times before, as she found the member of staff to be rude. Miss H says as she was being 
served the staff member told her to get off her phone. Miss H says she decided to ask the 
member of staff why she was being rude and explained she was on a phone call. And off the 
back of that the member of staff said Miss H had been abusive, and that she had threatened 
to come back and get her. As such NatWest took the decision to close her account.
NatWest have said it didnt refuse to serve Miss H in the first instance. It said it was happy to 
assist her, but Miss Hs demeanour was abusive and threatening to the extent that it decided 
to close the account in line with the terms and conditions. NatWest have said that Miss H 
had been abusive and threatening on a number of occasions and that she had made 
comments such as watch your back and you will regret it. Therefore, her account was 
closed in line with its terms and conditions under section 12.2 which states:
We can close your account immediately if you behave in a threatening or violent manner 
towards our staff.
Miss H didnt agree with NatWests version of events and has said the branch have lied 
about what happened. So, she brought the complaint to our service. Our investigator looked 
into the complaint, but she didnt recommend it be upheld. To summarise, she said that there 
is always two sides to every story, but on balance she thought it was more likely some form 
of altercation took place to make the branch feel strongly enough to request Miss Hs 
account be closed immediately. As such the account was closed in line with NatWests terms 
and conditions.
Miss H didnt agree. She felt the investigator had not taken her testimony into account and 
so she asked for the case to be passed to me to consider.
On 22 February 2022 I issued my provisional findings. I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss H thinks NatWest have discriminated and breached the Equality Act 2010 (EqA) 
because it closed her account and she was treated in a discriminatory way due to her race. I 
would like to highlight that it is not my role to decide if the EqA has been breached as thats 
for a court to decide. However, Ive looked at whether Miss H was treated fairly when
NatWest closed her account.
previous complaints about NatWests service
Miss H says that the member of staff she dealt with at NatWest lied and said she had 
behaved in a threatening manner when she hadnt. She believes this happened as she has 
raised complaints about this member of staff and the level of service provided previously and 
these complaints have been upheld and compensation has been paid. I asked Miss H to 
provide further information about the previous complaints and NatWests responses, but due 
to the passage of time she no longer has them.
When I asked NatWest for its comments in relation to Miss H raising previous complaints 
about the service it provided in branch, it agreed that Miss H had raised previous disputes. 
And in one of its staff members testimony it said:
each time Miss H would be compensated for the complaints that she would raise. There 
were at least twenty compensation payments to Miss H.
However, I asked NatWest to provide further information about this, including the responses 
and why the complaints were raised, in order for me to understand the experience Miss H 
had received and if her behaviour had been addressed in any complaint response. But 
NatWest have failed to provide that information and so I have been unable to do that.
However, both parties agree that previous complaints have been raised by Miss H and by 
NatWests own admission compensation has been paid, indicating these complaints have 
been upheld and the service Miss H received wasnt of a satisfactory standard.
Miss Hs previous visits to branch
NatWests version of events (including the staff members testimony) contradicts Miss Hs 
and there has been no CCTV footage provided. When this happens, I have to make a finding 
based on what I think is most likely to have happened. In order to do this, I asked NatWest to 
provide further information, but I havent received it.
NatWest says Miss H had behaved poorly in branch on several occasions, it said:
She would call in most weeks and was always very rude mainly in the way she spoke she 
was very abrupt
It went on to say:
she was very very rude /aggressive in her manner and I advised her that if she continued 
she may be put on notice to close her account and a note was added to reflect this.
I asked NatWest to provide further information in relation to this, such as the system note it 
referred to, or correspondence addressed to Miss H regarding her behaviour in branch. 
Again, this information wasnt provided.
The day in question
On the day the decision was taken to close Miss Hs account, NatWest says Miss H was 
aggressive abrupt and rude and used threatening language such as watch your back and 
you will regret it. NatWest has also provided a testimony which states one staff member
was physically shaking due to how Miss H behaved. Miss H says this is not the case.
I would firstly like to say that this service does not condone any customer acting in an 
aggressive or abusive manner. And if a consumer does act in this way, I think it is 
reasonable for a business, in this case NatWest, to act in accordance with its terms and conditions and close an account with immediate effect and follow any security processes it 
has in place.
However, closing an account immediately, can cause a degree of distress and 
inconvenience, as such, I think its only fair to expect a business to be able to evidence the 
reasons why it felt it was necessary to take that course of action.
In this case I am not satisfied NatWest has been able to evidence that. I dont dispute its 
recollection of events (or Miss Hs). But given the allegations that have been made against 
Miss H and the threats she apparently made; I think its reasonable to conclude some formal 
record would have been kept. Most organisations have a security process in place for these 
situations in order to protect their staff members. And I am not suggesting NatWest doesnt 
have one in place. But when enquiring if this was followed and requesting evidence of such 
process, it failed to provide it. It did however confirm that the police were not called to 
branch.
With this in mind, and the lack of evidence provided about Miss Hs previous visits to branch 
(where she has apparently been warned about her behaviour) I dont think there is enough 
evidence to conclude Miss Hs was threatening and abusive. As such, I dont think NatWest 
acted fairly in closing the account immediately.
That said, it is clear from both partys version of events that Miss H and NatWests 
relationship had broken down. Miss H was clearly unhappy with the level of service she was 
receiving. Therefore, I think it is likely that NatWest would have made a commercial decision 
to end its banking relationship with Miss H. And in accordance with its terms and conditions, 
NatWest is entitled to do this. However, this wouldnt be with immediate effect, NatWest 
would need to give Miss H notice, which is usually 60 days (I am happy for NatWest to 
correct me if this is not the case). However, as Miss H wasnt given notice (and Im not 
persuaded her behaviour was threatening or abusive) I think she should be compensated for 
not having the 60 days to handle her financial affairs.
Therefore, my provisional decision is that NatWest didnt treat Miss H fairly in deciding to 
close her account immediately. Miss H should have had the time outlined in NatWests terms 
and conditions. Because of this she experienced a level of inconvenience and upset which 
was unnecessary. Therefore, NatWest should pay Miss H £150 in recognition of this.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss H accepted by provisional findings. 
NatWest didnt say if it accepted my provisional findings, but it did provide further 
commentary. It said it couldnt provide system notes to show any entries had been made 
regarding Miss Hs behaviour, this was due to the passage of time. However, it could see 
notes from the last 12 months and confirmed there was nothing noted on the system.
NatWest also confirmed that as there wasnt any physical abuse towards staff members the 
police were not called. However, it wasnt able to confirm if its own internal security process 
was followed due to the passage of time. NatWest also referred back to its terms and 
conditions and highlighted that it can close an account if a customer behaves in a 
threatening or violent manner towards staff. 
I have taken NatWests further comments into consideration. However, I am not satisfied that Miss Hs behaviour outlined by NatWest amounts to violent and threatening behaviour and 
as such, I dont believe it was fair and reasonable to close her account immediately. But I 
agree that Miss Hs and NatWests relationship had broken down and as such, it was likely 
NatWest would have taken the steps to close her account, but with notice. Therefore, my 
decision remains the same as I highlighted in my provisional findings.
Putting right
I require National Westminster Bank Plc to pay Miss H £150 for the distress and 
inconvenience it has caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc  should pay Miss H  £150 for the 
distress and inconvenience it has caused
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 April 2022.
