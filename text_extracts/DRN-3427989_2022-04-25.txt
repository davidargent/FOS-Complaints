The complaint
Mr O complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money irresponsibly lent 
him a loan in December 2020. He says 118 118 Money should never have lent to him.
What happened
Mr O took out a loan for £2,000 with 118 118 Money in December 2020. The loan was for a 
term of 24 months with monthly repayments of £130.25, as I understand it theres still a 
balance outstanding on the loan. When Mr O complained to 118 118 Money, it didnt uphold 
his complaint, Mr O then referred his complaint to this service where it was looked at by one 
of our adjudicators. Our adjudicator thought that 118 118 Money shouldnt have lent to Mr O
118 118 Money disagreed and so the complaint was referred to an ombudsman for a 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before lending money to a consumer, a lender should take proportionate steps to 
understand whether the consumer could repay without borrowing further or suffering 
significant adverse consequences.
A lender should gather enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance and rules themselves didnt set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account before agreeing to lend. The 
key thing was that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to take into account 
things such as how much was being lent and when what was being borrowed was due to be 
repaid. A business should also take into account and react appropriately to what it knew 
about the consumer at the time it made its lending decision.
118 118 Money has provided evidence to show that before agreeing to lend Mr O this loan, it 
asked for his monthly income, monthly living costs and credit commitments. 118 118 Money 
also searched Mr Os credit file and has provided a copy of the results of it search from the 
time.
From what I can see, Mr O declared his income as £1,690 and £361.61 for his housing 
costs. I cant see that Mr O declared any other expenses apart from this. 118 118 Money 
says it used average living costs to work out Mr Os expenses, but it hasnt said what figure it 
used.
The results of 118 118 Moneys credit search showed concerning information. Mr O had a 
recent default within the last 12 months, he also had another default from 2018, both 
defaulted accounts still had outstanding balances on them which Mr O was liable to repay.
The credit file also shows that Mr O was close to the limit on three of his credit cards and 
over the limit on the credit card he held with 118 118 Money. The overall picture suggests 
that Mr O was struggling to manage his credit and 118 118 Money shouldnt have been 
lending to him in the circumstances.
I know the adjudicator also gave details of Mr Os circumstances using his bank statements 
at the time and 118 118 Money has suggested that Mr O was saving and so he may have 
had funds to repay the loan. I have looked at the information and from what I can see the 
balance in Mr Os saving pot in the month before the loan was about £3. The flow of the 
cash suggests that he was regularly transferring between his accounts, but I cant see that 
he had savings. 
118 118 Money will also know that its duty is beyond the pounds and pence calculation and 
its lending shouldnt have put Mr O in adverse financial circumstances. Overall, 118 118 
Money shouldnt have lent to Mr O and it needs to put things right.
Putting things right
To put things right 118 118 Money should:
remove all interest, fees and charges applied to the loan and treat all payments Mr O 
made towards the loan as payments towards the capital amount of £2,000.
If reworking the account results in Mr O paying more than the capital, then 118 118 
money should add interest of 8% simple a year on the overpayments from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement.
If reworking the account results in an outstanding balance, 118 118 Money should 
agree a suitable repayment plan with Mr O.
remove any negative information about the loan from Mr Os credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 Money 
must give Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct Madison CF UK Limited to 
put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 May 2022.
