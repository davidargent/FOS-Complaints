Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ks complaint and thought the loans from loan three onwards 
shouldnt have been given. QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr K 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN32187162But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr K could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr K, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
I think it was unlikely that loan 3 was going  to be affordable in a sustainable  way for Mr K, 
and QuickQuid should have realised this when he applied. Loan 3 was going to require Mr K 
to repay  approximately 30% of his declared disposable income in the final month of the 
instalments. Given the difficulties he appears to have had with loan 2, I think it unlikely hed 
have been in a position to build up reserves to cover  that. And QuickQuid  will have known 
that this was likely to cause Mr K difficulties, and that is was unlikely  hed be able to manage 
his finances to pay for the final large  payment. I say this because, although there had been  a 
gap of about 4 months after the end of loan 2a, Mr K had already  shown  signs  of difficulty  
earlier on in his borrowing  history. Loan  2a was a refinancing of loan 2. So this means hed 
borrowed more money even before hed repaid his outstanding loan,  with higher costs and 
over a longer  period.  And during that time hed incurred a late payment fee too. And, when 
he came  to ask for loan 3 it was for a significantly higher amount. 
Ref: DRN32187163I think QuickQuid should have realised that further borrowing was unlikely to have  been  
sustainable, and it shouldnt have agreed to loan 3. Following loan 3, Mr K came back for a 
further advance  on this only a few weeks later, and that made it so that his payment in his 
final month would be around 40% of his available  income that month. So that would have 
been even more unlikely to be repayable in a sustainable way. 
So I dont  think it was responsible for QuickQuid to agree  to the third loan. 
Mr K asked for a fourth loan in March 2017. This was for £250. At this point hed been 
borrowing from Quick Quid for over a year  he first asked for a loan of £300  in February 
2016. At this point  Quick Quid should have  realised that Mr K wasnt  borrowing to cover a 
short term gap in his finances but to meet an ongoing need.  And so he wasnt likely to be 
able to repay this loan in a sustainable way. So I think Quick  Quid was irresponsible  to have 
agreed to this loan and to further credit  for him.
 
I think that Mr K lost out when QuickQuid continued  to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards. This is because  these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ks 
indebtedness over an extended period, by allowing him to take expensive credit intended for 
short-term use. Altogether, Mr K borrowed from Quick Quid  for over four years.  Taking out 
short term credit  for this length  of time was likely  to be seen negatively by other lenders and 
potentially restricted his access to credit elsewhere.  
In summary  - Im upholding the complaint about loans three to six, and QuickQuid should put 
things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans three to six (loans taken from 29 
December 2016 onwards)
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information  recorded  about loan three;
the number  of loans taken from loan four onwards means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans four to six should  be removed from 
Mr Ks credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr K a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN32187164my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ks complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
should pay Mr K compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 August 2019.
