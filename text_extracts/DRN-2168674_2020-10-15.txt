In the most recent assessment, our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Hs complaint and 
thought the loans from loan 7 onwards shouldnt have been given because it looked like he 
wasnt managing his money and was becoming reliant on this type of lending. 
Quid Market disagreed. It said Mr H repaid all the loans and that it based its lending on 
information provided by Mr H and credit reports it had access to. 
As Quid Market asked for an ombudsmans decision, the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Quid Market needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Quid Market should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Quid Market was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint. 
There was a significant break in Mr Hs borrowing from Quid Market. There was a gap of 
around a year between loans 13 and 14. I think it would be reasonable for Quid Market to 
view this gap as an indication that Mr Hs finances had stabilised after whatever the 
circumstances were that had caused him to take out his previous loans. So, I will look at    
Mr Hs borrowing in two separate lending chains. Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mr Hs complaint about loans 1 to 6. Mr H didnt respond to the 
adjudicators opinion. As there appears to no longer be a dispute about these loans, I wont 
be making any further findings on them. This leaves loan 7 onwards for me to consider.
Chain one  loans 7 to 13
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Quid Markets lending history with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Quid Market should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Quid Market should have realised 
that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7. I say 
this because: 
At this point Quid Market ought to have realised Mr H was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr H had taken out seven loans within seven months. So, Quid 
Market ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr H was having to borrow 
further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Hs first loan was for £225 and loan 7 was for £550.  At this point Quid Market 
ought to have known that it was unlikely Mr H was borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Quid Market. Loan 13 
was taken out over two years after Mr Hs first. And it was for a much larger amount. 
Mr H had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Quid Market 
over an extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out because Quid Market continued to provide borrowing at loan 7 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans. 
Chain two  loans 14 to 19
Quid Market says it carried out checks before it lent loan 14 to Mr H and the results of these 
checks didnt raise any concerns. But this was Mr Hs 14th loan with Quid Market so I think it 
should have been looking to build a clearer picture than it did about Mr Hs finances before 
lending to him again. 
Had Quid Market carried out proportionate checks, its likely to have found Mr H had 
outstanding loans with other short-term lenders. This - added to his other significant credit 
commitments which was visible on the credit report Quid Market has provided to us - would 
have shown that Mr H was in a debt-cycle and was likely borrowing further to repay other 
borrowing.  
Again, Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Quid Markets lending history with Mr H, with 
a view to seeing if there was a point at which Quid Market should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Quid Market should have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 19. I say 
this because: 
At this point Quid Market ought to have realised Mr H was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. In this chain Mr H had taken out six loans within 20 months. So, 
Quid Market ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr H was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
The first loan in chain two was for £600 and loan 19 was for £1,000.  At this point 
Quid Market ought to have known that it was unlikely Mr H was borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Quid Market. Loan 19 
was taken out nearly four years after Mr Hs first. And it was for a much larger 
amount. Mr H had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Quid 
Market over an extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out because Quid Market continued to provide borrowing at loan 19 
because:
again, this loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the number of loans plus the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans. 
So, Im upholding Mr Hs complaint about loans 7 to 19 and Quid Market should put things 
right.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 7 to 19;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 14 to 18 from Mr Hs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 to 13 and loan 19 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 7 to 13 and 19 should be 
removed from Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Quid Market to take off tax from this interest. Quid Market must 
give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decisionFor the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Hs complaint. Stagemount Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 November 2020.
