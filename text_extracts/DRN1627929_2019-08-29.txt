K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that MYJAR  Limited  was irresponsible when it lent to him. He asks for an 
apology and a refund of interest.
background
Mr S took out 10 loans  with MYJAR between April 2015 and July 2017.  He says MYJAR  
should have realised there was a problem when he repeatedly  took out loans in increasing 
amounts. Mr S says he had to borrow to meet repayments and entered  a debt management 
plan in 2017.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld. She said it wasnt wrong 
for MYJAR  to offer loans  1 to 5 to Mr S. But it shouldnt have given him loans 6 to 10. She 
said by this point  Mr Ss pattern of borrowing suggested he was reliant on short term loans. 
Mr S had taken out five loans in eight months  and the amounts were  increasing. This 
suggested the borrowing wasnt sustainable.
Our adjudicator said MYJAR should refund interest  and charges  on loans 6 to 10, with 8% 
interest, and remove any information about them from Mr Ss credit  file.
MYJAR didnt agree.  It said the adjudicator hadnt  explained how she reached her decision 
or what evidence shed based  it on. It asked that an ombudsman  writes a decision which 
refers to its checks and applicable regulations. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice, this means that it should have  carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mr S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
Mr Ss income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending  
relationship, less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Some of the loans given to Mr S needed  to be repaid in monthly  instalments over three  to six 
months. So the amounts that Mr S needed  to repay  each month were smaller  than if hed 
taken a normal payday loan. But of course  he was committing to making those repayments 
over a longer  period.  
Mr S took out the following loans with MYJAR:

4 25.08.2015 £200 £246 23.09.2015

7 24.06.2016 £500 6 instalments, £148 23.11.2016
8 23.11.2016 £600 6 instalments, £179 18.05.2017
9 13.06.2017 £150 3 instalments, £79 21.07.2017
10 24.07.2017 £700 6 instalments, £208 unpaid balance 
When Mr S applied  for loan 1 he told MYJAR  his monthly  income was £1,400.  When he 
applied for loans 2 to 5 he said his monthly  income  was £1,300.  MYJAR  says Mr S told it his 
monthly outgoings were  between £450  and £880.  MYJAR says it did credit checks and the 
results didnt alert it to any problems. 
I think MYJAR might have done more thorough checks before agreeing  loans 4 and 5. But I 
dont think, given the amount of the loan repayments  and Mr Ss stated income, 
proportionate checks would have given it any reason to think loans 1 to 5 werent affordable  
or that further  checks were needed.  
I think that its important to note that MYJAR  needed to establish  that Mr S could sustainably  
repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were  affordable  on a strict pounds and 
pence calculation.  This means that Mr S should  be able to meet loan repayments without 
undue difficulties, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without having to 
borrow further.
Certain factors might suggest that MYJAR should fairly and reasonably have done more to 
establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr S. These factors include the amount of the 
loans and the repayments, Mr Ss income  and the number and frequency of loans.  Repeat  
borrowing could suggest that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable.  
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. I think  that this point was reached when 
Mr S asked for loan 6. Ive explained  why below.
When Mr S took out loan 6 hed been borrowing  from MYJAR for nine months  without a 
break. The amounts  of the loans increased.  Mr S consistently took out a new loan 
immediately or within  a few days of repaying  the previous loan. I think this borrowing pattern 
could suggest  a problem  such as reliance on short term loans  or problems with managing 
his money. Its likely Mr S was having  to take out a new loan to fill the gap in his finances left 
by repaying the previous loan.
Mr S continued to borrow from MYJAR. By the time he took out loan 10 hed been borrowing 
from MYJAR  for more  than two years. The longest  break between his loans was less than a 
month.
The amounts of the loans varied,  but there  wasnt a consistent reduction in the amount Mr S 
owed. Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed  MYJAR.  In effect, Mr S 
paid large amounts of interest  to service a debt to MYJAR over an extended period.
I think MYJAR should have known  this lending wasnt sustainable.
Ref: DRN16279293I dont think MYJAR should have  given loans 6 to 10 to Mr S. So it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 6 to 10;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  applied to loans  6 to 10, apply the refund to 
reduce any capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr S; and
remove all entries about  loans 6 to 10 from Mr Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If MYJAR intends  to 
apply the refund to reduce  any outstanding  capital  balance, it must do so after deducting  the 
tax.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order MYJAR Limited to amend Mr Ss credit file 
and pay the compensation as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 September  2019.
