K821x#15complaint
Mr N complains about fees incurred on his mortgage  account thats administered by 
Pepper (UK) Limited (trading as Engage Credit). From here, Ill refer to the business as 
Engage.
background
The mortgage has been in arrears for many years  and fees and charges were applied to the 
account. 
In response to the initial complaint, Engage offered to refund four arrears administration  fees 
totalling £160. These were fees that had been charged in months  where Mr N had made  the 
full monthly payment due.
An adjudicator looked at the complaint. She explained that Engage  didnt consent  to us 
considering fees and charges applied more than six years before it received the complaint 
on 5 April 2018. The claims management  company thats representing Mr N accepted  this.
The adjudicator looked at fees and charges applied since 5 April 2012. She noted that there 
were arrears  administration fees applied in months  where legal costs had also been applied. 
She asked  Engage to refund fees as follows:
15 October 2013 £40
15 November 2013 £40
15 January 2014 £40
15 November 2014 £40
15 December 2014 £40
30 September 2016 £23.50
Engage didnt agree it should have  to refund these fees. It didnt accept there  was any 
duplication of work  where legal fees had been applied. As the parties couldnt agree its been  
passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
overall conclusions  as the adjudicator,  and for the same reasons.
Im satisfied its fair to apply charges to cover the specific cost of specific  legal work  done  
over and above the normal routine  management  of the mortgage account. But I dont think  
its then necessary or fair still to charge  an arrears  administration fee for routine 
management in the same month. That being  so, Ive decided  Engage  should  rework the 
mortgage account to remove, backdated for interest purposes, the monthly arrears 
administration fees identified by our adjudicator. To be clear these are:
15 October 2013 £40
15 November 2013 £40
15 January 2014 £40
15 November 2014 £40
15 December 2014 £40

my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement, I direct 
Pepper (UK) Limited (trading as Engage Credit)  to rework the mortgage account  as detailed 
above. I make no other order  or award.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 May 2019.
