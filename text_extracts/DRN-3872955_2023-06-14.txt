The complaint
Mr C complains that Vacation Finance Limited wont refund to him the money that he paid for 
a holiday club membership. Hes being represented in his complaint by a claims 
management company.
What happened
Mr C says that hed bought holiday products including two floating weeks in February 2014 
for £21,000 and an additional week in May 2016 for £18,231. He says that he used loans 
from other finance providers to pay for those purchases so they arent included in this 
complaint.
He says that he upgraded to a nicer apartment for a total cost of £18,200 in June 2017 which 
was financed through a consolidated loan with a lender that he named (but not as Vacation 
Finance). He entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Vacation Finance in June 2017 
to buy a holiday club membership which had a cash price of £26,000. The loan agreement 
shows that he made an advance payment of £7,800 so the loan amount was £18,200 and he 
agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £236.50 to Vacation Finance. 
Mr Cs representative made claims to some of those finance providers (but not Vacation 
Finance) in January 2019 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and 
Mr C provided a statement in support of those claims. It then made the same claims to 
Vacation Finance in March 2022. It said that the membership was miss-sold to Mr C and, but 
for the misrepresentations made to him, he wouldnt have purchased it nor entered into the 
loan agreement. It said that the holiday company was now in liquidation so cant provide the 
service sold and is in breach of contract. It also said that the terms of the agreement are so 
egregious as to be unfair and the payment of commission was hidden from view.
A complaint had been made to this service and the complaint form said that: Vacation 
Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mr C; the 
holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of his ability to afford the loan, 
unduly pressured him into entering into the agreements and used aggressive commercial 
practices to pressure him; and the product was misrepresented to him; all rendering the 
agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A and it said that the claim should also be 
considered under section 75. Vacation Finance hasnt responded to those claims.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Cs complaint should be upheld. He said that 
Mr C hadnt described the conversation and circumstances surrounding the alleged 
representations in detail and that the allegations arent supported by any other evidence so 
he wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale. He thought that 
Mr C would still have been able to use his membership to book holidays and experiences 
despite the holiday company going into liquidation in May 2020 so he didnt think that the 
holiday company had breached the contract. He said that he hadnt seen enough to suggest 
that the relationship between Mr C and Vacation Finance was unfair and he wasnt 
persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He said 
that Mr C had reasonable disposable income left each month to sustainably afford the 
repayments of the loan and that he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the 
lending was unaffordable for him.
Mr Cs representative says that Mr C doesnt accept our investigators recommendation so 
would like the matter referred to an ombudsman for a decision. It said that it would be 
lodging detailed submissions in support of Mr Cs complaint but no further submission has 
been received.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Cs complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Cs claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Vacation 
Finances response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Vacation Finance hasnt responded to Mr Cs claims - so I cant say that its response 
has been fair or reasonable - but Ive been provided with a copy of the loan 
agreement that Mr C signed in June 2017, his representatives March 2022 letter to 
Vacation Finance and his statement;
Ive not been provided with a copy of the agreement that Mr C entered into with the 
holiday company in June 2017 or the other documents that its likely that he would 
have also signed at that time;
Mr C says that he was told that hed get better availability by upgrading and his 
representative says that it was represented to Mr C that the product would be easier 
to sell as part of the holiday companys re-sale scheme, would make a higher profit 
for him and that the product was available at a special price but only if purchased on 
that day;
Mr C says hes not seen an increase in availability and has had to compromise on 
some aspect of the holiday whenever he wanted to book but hes provided no 
documentary or other evidence in support of his claim that he was told that he would 
get better availability by upgrading, that he hasnt received better availability than he 
would have received if he hadnt upgraded or that the availability was misrepresented 
to him;
Mr Cs statement doesnt make reference to him being told that the product would be 
easier to sell as part of the holiday companys re-sale scheme, would make a higher 
profit for him or that the product was available at a special price but only if purchased 
on that day and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that those 
representations were made to Mr C or that the membership was sold to him as an 
investment;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership was 
misrepresented or mis-sold to Mr C by the holiday company or that he was induced into entering into the agreement for the purchase of the membership by any such 
misrepresentations;
I understand that the holiday company went into liquidation in May 2020 and I 
consider that the liquidation of the holiday company would be a breach of contract for 
which Vacation Finance would be liable under section 75;
but I also understand that a new management company has been appointed to 
provide the services in connection with the membership that Mr C had bought from 
the holiday company in June 2017 and that the membership is available for him to 
use;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr Cs use of the membership has been 
adversely impacted by the liquidation of the holiday company and I consider the 
appointment of the new management company to have been a suitable remedy for 
any breach of contract and Im not persuaded that Mr C would be entitled to 
terminate his membership in these circumstances;
Mr Cs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr C and 
Vacation Finance because it paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt 
declared to Mr C; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of his 
ability to afford the loan; unduly pressured him into entering into the agreements and 
used aggressive commercial practices to pressure him; and the product was 
misrepresented to him; 
Ive already explained why Im not persuaded that that the membership was 
misrepresented to Mr C and Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what 
commission, if any, was paid by Vacation Finance to the holiday company - but, from 
what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended 
to be low and of less than 15% and Im satisfied that Vacation Finance wouldnt have 
breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any regulatory 
duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these circumstances - and I 
dont consider that the level of any commission that was normally paid in this type of 
situation was sufficiently high to mean that Vacation Finance should have 
appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr C risked the relationship being 
unfair under section 140A;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr C was unduly 
pressured into buying the membership in June 2017 or entering into the loan 
agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptably aggressive sales 
practices against him;
Mr C says that he was subject to very high pressured sales tactics when he bought 
the holiday products in February 2014 and May 2016 so I would expect him to have 
been prepared for the sales tactics that might be used by the holiday company before 
he went into the sales presentation in June 2017 and that, if he didnt want to buy the 
membership, he would have made that clear to the holiday company at that time;
Mr Cs representative says that the holiday company failed to conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr Cs ability to afford the loan and, as Vacation Finance hasnt 
responded to his claims, it hasnt provided any evidence about its assessment of the 
affordability of the loan for Mr C;
Mr C provided an income and expenditure statement in September 2022 which 
shows that he had a monthly income of more than £2,900 and monthly expenditure 
of less than £2,000 so I consider that he would have had enough disposable income 
to have been able to sustainably afford a loan with monthly payments of £236.50;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for him in June 2017 when it was made to him or that Vacation Finance 
shouldnt have made the loan to him;
Mr Cs representative says that the terms of the agreement are so egregious as to be 
unfair - but (other than the loan agreement) Ive not been provided with copies of the 
documents that Mr C would have signed in June 2017 and it would be for a court to 
determine whether or not any of the terms in those documents were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr C and I consider it to 
be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the terms of the 
documents created an unfair relationship between Mr C and Vacation Finance;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Cs relationship with 
Vacation Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr C and Vacation Finance in 
these circumstances;
although Vacation Finance didnt respond to Mr Cs claims, I consider that it would 
have been fair and reasonable for it not to have upheld his claims if it had properly 
considered them; and
I sympathise with Mr C for the issues that hes had with his membership, but I find 
that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Vacation Finance to refund to Mr C any of the money that hes paid under the loan 
agreement, to cancel the loan, to pay him any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 July 2023.
