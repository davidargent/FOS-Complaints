The complaint
Mr D complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Marbles lent to him irresponsibly by increasing 
his credit limit.
What happened
In April 2016 Mr D opened a credit card account with NewDay with an initial credit limit of 
£250. In November 2016 NewDay increased the credit limit to £400. In February 2017 it was 
increased to £1000. In July 2017 it was increased to £1600 and in September 2017 it was 
increased to £2350.
Mr D complained that NewDay had lent irresponsibly. NewDay didnt agree, so Mr D brought 
his complaint to this service.
Our investigator reviewed everything. He said the first credit limit increase was fair but 
thought that NewDay hadnt carried out reasonable and proportionate checks before 
approving the second credit limit increase.
NewDay didnt agree. It said the second credit limit increase wasnt disproportionate to Mr 
Ds income. It said the highest contractual payment requested on a fully utilised credit limit of 
£1000 was £40.84. It said that Mr D had sufficient disposable income to make an increase of 
£20 in his monthly repayments affordable.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible and unaffordable 
lending, including the key relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice, on our 
website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering Mr Ds complaint.
NewDay needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, 
this means it shouldve carried out reasonable and proportionate checks to make sure Mr D 
could afford to repay what he was being lent in a sustainable manner. These checks could 
take into account a number of things, such as how much was being lent, the repayments 
amount, Mr Ds borrowing history and his income and expenditure.
NewDay has provided details of the checks it carried out each time a credit limit increase 
was provided. It says that these checks show that it was reasonable to lend to Mr D.
Credit limit increase 1 - £250 to £400 November 2016
I can see from the checks that Mr Ds income was £17,000 per year (gross). This equates to 
around £1227 per month (net). NewDay has provided copies of Mr Ds account statements 
which it used to check whether Mr D had exceeded the previous credit limit or missed any 
payments. NewDay also looked at what proportion of the credit limit Mr D had utilised and 
what payments he had made.
NewDay also took into account Mr Ds credit search results to check things such as 
repayment plans, payday loan history, arrears and total external credit commitments.
At the time of the first credit limit increase, the credit search results show that Mr D had 
existing credit commitments of £1775 (excluding secured debt). There was no adverse 
information on his credit file in relation to the four credit accounts.
Since opening the NewDay credit card account in April 2016, Mr D had used the card 
regularly. He hadnt exceeded the credit limit and there were no missed payments. The 
payments Mr D had made were more than the monthly minimum payment.
Based on what Ive seen, I think the checks carried out by NewDay before the first credit limit 
increase were reasonable and proportionate. Im satisfied that the information gathered by 
NewDay showed that the credit was likely to be affordable for Mr D. Therefore, I dont think 
NewDay acted irresponsibly when it increased the credit limit from £250 to £400.
Credit limit increase 2 - £400 to £1000 February 2017
I can see that Mr Ds income was still £1227 (net) per month. The credit search results 
showed that Mr D had existing credit commitments of around £1295 (excluding secured 
debt).
Looking at the NewDay credit card statements, Mr D had used the card regularly. He hadnt 
exceeded the credit limit or missed any payments. The payments made by Mr D on the 
account were more than the minimum payment.
Ive thought about the credit limit increase in relation to Mr Ds income. As Ive said, Mr Ds 
monthly income was around £1227. The credit limit was increased to £1000. Given that the 
level of credit was high in proportion to Mr Ds income, I think NewDay shouldve carried out 
further checks to obtain information about Mr Ds monthly expenditure, in order to make sure 
that the credit limit increase was affordable.
Because I dont think NewDay carried out reasonable and proportionate checks before 
approving the second credit limit increase, Ive gone on to consider what reasonable and 
proportionate checks wouldve shown. To do this, Ive looked at Mr Ds bank statements for 
the three months preceding the second credit limit increase. These show that Mr D had 
average net monthly income of £1266 and average monthly outgoings of £1119. This left Mr 
D with monthly disposable income of around £147.
Taking into account the monthly minimum payment after the second credit limit increase, I 
dont think the second credit limit increase was affordable for Mr D, because it left him with 
insufficient monthly disposable income to meet any unplanned expenditure.
Ive taken into account the points made by NewDay. The fact that a consumer may have 
more money coming in than going out isnt how we assess affordability. I need to be satisfied 
that Mr D could repay the additional credit sustainably. Based on what Ive seen, Im not 
satisfied that the credit was affordable.
Therefore, I dont think NewDay shouldve increased the credit limit from £400 to £1000.
Putting things right
Because I dont think NewDay shouldve increased the credit limit from £400 to £1000, I 
dont think its fair for it to charge and interest or charges on balances which exceeded that 
limit. Mr D has, however, had the benefit of the money spent on the account, so I think he should pay this back.
To put things right NewDay Ltd must:
Rework the account removing all interest and charges that have been applied to balances 
above £400
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Mr D along with 8% 
simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the date of 
settlement, NewDay should also remove all adverse information recorded after 20 February 
2017 in relation to the account from Mr Ds credit file.
If, after the rework, the outstanding balance exceeds £400, NewDay should arrange an 
affordable repayment plan with Mr D for the remaining amount. Once Mr D has cleared the 
outstanding balance, any adverse information recorded after 20 February 2017 in relation to 
the account should be removed from Mr Ds credit file.
*HMRC require NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. NewDay must give Mr D a 
certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if he asks for this.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. NewDay Ltd must take the steps Ive set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 February 2023.
