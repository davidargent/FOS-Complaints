K821x#15complaint
Ms K complains  that Instant Cash Loans Limited, trading as The Money Shop, (ICL)  was 
irresponsible to give her the loans she applied  for. 
background
Ms K took ten payday loans and one instalment loan between  May 2012 and August 2014. 
Our adjudicator considered the complaint and thought that ICL should put things right for 
Ms K in relation to Loans 6 to 8. ICL accepted this opinion and offered to do as our 
adjudicator recommended. Ms K was not content.  
Ms K sent in some additional information   bank statements - which  covered the later period 
of lending and so our adjudicator could review  those other loans as well. In his second letter 
of opinion he recommended that ICL put things right for Loans 6 to 10. Our adjudicators 
view was that Loan 11 was affordable as it was an instalment loan. 
Ms K was happy  with that second set of recommendations  for her complaint. And from this 
I understand that Ms K takes no issue with the other aspects of our adjudicators  view.  
After receiving that second opinion, ICL clarified  one point  but did not respond  in relation to 
the merits. After that it sent some additional  background information. And the complaint has 
been passed to me for a decision.
From the background then the unresolved  loans seem to be just Loans 9 and 10. So I have 
reviewed these only but within the context  of the lending  overall.  
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner 
without it adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. 
The key element was that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to take into 
account a number of different things, including how much was being  lent and when the sum 
being borrowed was due to be repaid. 
ICL has said that it made various checks but it told Ms K in its final response letter that 
sometimes it asks the credit bureau agencies for information. Its files to us do not include 
any credit  bureau information.  So the credit check information ICL may have obtained is not 
evidenced.  
Ref: DRN72147312It explained to Ms K that The loan repayments  were low value and appeared to be 
affordable based  on the information  you declared. There didnt appear to be any particular 
issues with other lenders  that concern me and I dont think you were  reliant on borrowing 
from us at these times.
From this is seems that ICL did do some checks.  Ive not seen the results.
 
Loan 9 was approved in December 2013 and the first after a significant  gap and so 
I consider that ICL was able to approach her application  as if she was a new customer.  This 
leads me to think that the proportionate  checks were likely  to have been to know Ms Ks 
income and her expenditure because the repayments were  relatively  high compared  with her 
salary. 
As Ive outlined above I dont think ICL made these checks. So Ive looked at the information 
Ive been provide to see what ICL wouldve fund out if it had made proportionate checks. 
The information I have  received in relation  to Ms Ks financial situation at the time does lead 
me to conclude that Ms K was not able to afford Loans 9 and 10. So I uphold her complaint 
in relation to Loans 9 and 10. For completeness, I mention here all of the loans including the 
ones ICL has already  agreed to put right. 
putting things right
ICL needs to:
refund  all interest and charges that Ms K paid on loans 6 to 10 including both loan 8 
rollovers;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date
of settlement*;
remove any negative payment information about these loans from Ms Ks credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires ICL to take off tax from this interest. It must give Ms K a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Ks complaint in part and direct  that Instant Cash  Loans 
Limited trading  as ICL put things  right for Ms K by doing as I have said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 June  2019.
