K821x#15complaint
Mr E says Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny)  shouldve  have lent to him 
because it didnt carry out sufficient affordability checks. Had it carried out better  checks it 
wouldve seen that he was stuck in a cycle of borrowing.  
background
Mr E took 10 instalment  loans from Sunny between February 2018 and April 2018. And a 
summary of Mr Es borrowing,  based  on the information provided to us from Sunny, can be 
found in the table below:

In our adjudicators most recent findings  she thought Sunny had treated Mr E fairly  when it 
gave him loans 1  3. However, she didnt  think that any of the remaining loans shouldve 
been provided.  
By loan 4 the adjudicator  thought that Sunny needed to have carried out more detailed 
checks, which wouldve  involved  verifying the information Mr E had provided. And the 
adjudicator thought that had further  checks been  carried out Sunny wouldve been aware of 
another payday loan, with a different company, and that Mr Es actual income was around 
half of what he declared to Sunny. The adjudicator thought, that as a result of this, Sunny 
shouldnt have provided any of the remaining loans.   
Mr E appears to have  accepted the adjudicators  findings.  
However, Sunny didnt  accept the adjudicators findings. It made a number of points 
including: 
although Mr E had four loans running at one time, Sunny didnt lend to him more than 
the credit  limit it had set;
the total amount Mr E needed to pay was relatively small compared to his income;
Mr E had no problems repaying  his loans, indeed he repaid them  early  and 
the amounts  he borrowed  fluctuated.  
As no agreement could be reached, the case has been passed to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
Ref: DRN25561612complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
There doesnt appear to be an outstanding dispute about loans 1  3, so I wont  be making a 
finding on these  loans in this decision.  
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to figure out whether 
Mr E could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So Sunny was required to establish  whether  Mr E could sustainably  repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  Mr E could 
sustainably make his repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Es complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, proportionate checks from loan 4 ought to have included  
verifying the information Mr E was providing. And I agree with the adjudicator that at this 
point in the lending relationship Sunny needed to do more than just rely on what it was being 
told by Mr E. 
I say this because  this was now Mr Es fourth  loan in quick  succession and the amount he 
was expecting to repay  was a significant amount compared to his declared income. So I 
think Sunny  needed to be alert to the idea that Mr E may have been having  some wider 
financial problems and to reassure itself I think it wouldve been reasonable to have started  
to verify the information it was being provided.   So had Sunny carried  out a proportionate 
check; its likely it wouldve seen that:
Ref: DRN25561613Mr Es actual  income was significantly less than what  Sunny believed it to be. I 
appreciate Sunny  have concerns about why Mr E may not have provided an accurate 
picture of his income. But ultimately,  what Mr Es motivation was makes  no difference 
to my findings. Had Sunny carried out what Id consider to be proportionate checks it 
wouldve most likely seen  that Mr Es income  was around half of what he declared.  
Mr E also had another short  term loan with another providing, meaning at the point 
loan 4 was approved Mr E needed to service five separate  payday  loans  which  
took up a significant portion of Mr Es actual monthly  income.
So, in these circumstances,  there  was a significant  risk that Mr E wouldnt have been 
able to repay this loan or any further  loan without undue difficulty or without  the need 
to borrow again.  
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 - 7 and Sunny should put things right as 
detailed below.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr E paid on loans 4 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 - 7 from Mr Es credit  file
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr E a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Es complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr E as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 December  2019.
