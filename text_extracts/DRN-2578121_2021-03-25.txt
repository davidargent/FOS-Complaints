Complaint
Mr M is unhappy with the interest that Hitachi Capital (UK) Plc (Hitachi) charged him on his 
point of sale loan. 
Background
In October 2018, Mr M paid for a bathroom with a loan from Hitachi. The loan was for 
£2,646.00 and had a 60-month term. No payments were due in the first 12 months. And if  
Mr M paid the total loan amount plus a £29.00 administration fee, before his first scheduled 
instalment of £92.27 on 27 October 2019, the accrued would be waived. However, if Mr M 
didnt clear the balance by then he was scheduled to make 48 monthly payments of £92.27 
meaning the total amount to be repaid (including interest of £1,782.96) would be £4,722.96.
Mr M wanted to make 12 equal payments of around £222 to clear the balance and set up a 
standing order to make these payments. However, the standing order wasnt set up until 
December 2018. This meant that the twelfth payment wouldnt be made until November 
2019  after the date that the balance was due to be cleared. And as the balance wasnt 
cleared by the date of Mr Ms October 2019 payment interest of £335.53 was added to his 
account. Mr M was unhappy with this and complained.
 
Hitachi didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint. It said Mr M was told he needed to have cleared the 
amount advanced plus the administration fee in full, by 27 October 2019, in order to benefit 
from the interest waiver. The required amount wasnt paid in full by this date and so it added 
interest as it was entitled to. Mr Ms complaint was then considered by one of our 
adjudicators. He didnt think Hitachi had treated Mr M unfairly and so didnt recommend the 
complaint be upheld. Mr M disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans review. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered everything, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ms complaint. Ill 
explain why in a little more detail.
Mr M initially said that he didnt know he had to pay the total amount advanced plus the 
administration by 27 October 2019 in order to benefit from the interest waiver. But the 
section of Mr Ms signed agreement entitled Repayments says:
Duration of the agreement 60 months. Under this agreement you will pay 48 
consecutive monthly payments of £ 92.27 commencing on 27/10/2019 (Deferred First 
Payment Date). Subsequent payments will be due on the same date in each month. If by 
the Deferred First Payment Date you have paid to us the Amount of Credit in full, you 
will not have to pay any interest, but you will have to pay an administration fee of 
£29.00 We will send you a reminder before the Deferred First Payment Date.
Hitachi sent the above-mentioned reminder letter to Mr M on 15 September 2019. It said:
I write to remind you that your Deferral Period ends on 27 October 2019. Should you wish to 
settle your agreement interest free, you will be required to pay £470.00. This includes the 
early settlement administration fee of £29.
The full payment must be received by us before 27 October 2019.
The simplest way to pay your agreement in full is to login to my.hpf.co.uk where you have 
easy access to your agreement details.
Should you prefer to spread the cost of your loan please ensure you have an active Direct 
Debit to allow the successful collection of your monthly payments.
Your Direct Debit will automatically claim your first payment of £92.27 on 27 October 2019.
Subsequent payments are due on the same date of each month.
I appreciate Mr M may have, albeit mistakenly, believed the standing order he set up would 
ensure the amount he needed to repay would be repaid on time. And I do sympathise with 
hes had to pay interest he wasnt expecting to pay. 
But it might help for me to explain that its only fair and reasonable for me to uphold a 
complaint in circumstances where a lender did something wrong. And I dont think Hitachi 
did anything wrong here. As Ive set out above, Mr Ms loan agreement clearly set out he 
had to pay £2,675.00 by 27 October 2019 in order to benefit from the interest waiver. And in 
September 2019, Hitachi also reminded Mr M he still had a further £470 to pay by               
27 October 2019 if he wanted to settle the agreement before interest was charged.  
So Im satisfied Hitachi clearly set out of the terms of the interest waiver and also reminded 
Mr M how much he still left had to pay and when this needed to be paid by a month before 
the due date. As this is the case, Im not upholding Mr Ms complaint. I appreciate this will be 
disappointing for Mr M  especially as he believes Hitachi should waive the interest because 
it was a miscalculation which led to his failure to pay the full amount required in time. But I 
hope hell understand the reasons for my decision and hell at least feel his concerns have 
been listened to.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 April 2021.
