The complaint
Ms B says S.D. Taylor Limited trading as Loans at Home (LaH) lent to her irresponsibly. She 
says that she was in a debt spiral when she borrowed the loans and she couldnt afford the 
repayments. She thinks that LaH shouldve seen this and not lent to her. 
  
What happened
This complaint is about 84 home collected loans LaH provided to Ms B between April 2009 
and January 2018. Some of the information I have been provided, about some of the 
lending, is in the table below (Ive not included some loans to save space).

LaH has said that this Service shouldnt consider loans 1 to 55 as Ms B complained more 
than six years after they were lent. So, it doesnt think they are within the jurisdiction of the 
Financial Ombudsman Service. 
LaH didnt think it had lent irresponsibly for loans 56 to 82. But it said that it shouldnt have 
approved loans 83 and 84. It offered compensation on the same basis that I would award if I 
were to uphold the complaint about this lending. Ms B hasnt agreed to this compensation. 
Our adjudicator firstly said she thought Ms B had complained in time about loans 1 to 55 
This is because whilst she made her complaint more than six years from when she started 
taking the loans there was no evidence to suggest she complained later than three years 
before she was aware or ought to have been aware she could complain.  
Our adjudicator then looked at the merits of the complaint and went on to partially uphold it. 
She said that by loan 7 the lending pattern itself looked to have become harmful, and so LaH 
shouldve stopped lending at this point. 
LaH disagreed with the adjudicators opinion about the jurisdiction of the complaint. It said 
that, essentially, Ms B had some repayment difficulties in 2017. So, she would have been 
aware that the loans were causing her problems more than three years before she made her 
complaint. And she should have been aware that she could complain about them earlier than 
she did. It says this this approach would be consistent with other answers that LaH, and its 
parent company, have received from the Financial Ombudsman Service recently. 
Ms B didnt disagree with what the adjudicator said. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me to make a 
decision. 
Why I can look into this complaint
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments provided by Ms B and LaH to 
decide whether we are able to look at all loans being complained about. Having done so, I 
have reached the same conclusion as the adjudicator  that I have the power to consider all 
the loans being complained about. Ill explain why. 
The rules I must apply say that, where a business doesnt agree, I cant look at a complaint 
made more than six years after whats been complained about, or if later, more than three 
years after the complainant (in this case, Ms B) knew, or should really have known she had 
reason to complain. This is set out in Dispute Resolution rule 2.8.2R and can be found online 
in the FCAs Handbook. 
Its clear loans 1 to 55 were complained about more than six years after they were taken. 
However, Ive not seen anything to persuade me Ms B was aware or ought to have been 
aware more than three years before she raised this complaint, that she had reason to 
complain. LaH has said that when Ms B experienced repayment problems this shouldve 
caused her to realise she had reason to complain. But I dont think this is enough in this 
particular case to demonstrate that. 
I say this because whilst experiencing repayment problems would no doubt have led Ms B to 
realise there was a problem (in terms of the financial difficulty), Im not persuaded this would 
have (or ought to have), in itself, made her aware that these problems were caused by LaH 
doing something wrong when it agreed the loans. And in any event LaH hasnt provided any 
detail about what it said to Ms B about this. 
And I havent seen anything else to persuade me that Ms B was or should have been aware 
earlier of cause to complain more than three years before she complained. 
So, like our adjudicator, I think loans 1 to 55 were raised within the time limits I need to apply 
and that I do have the power to consider them. Ill now go on and consider whether or not I 
think all the loans complained about were lent responsibly. 
  
What Ive decided  and whyIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
LaH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms B could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that LaH should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Ms Bs complaint in part and Ive have explained why below.
Ms B didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 6. And LaH agrees loans 
83 and 84 should be upheld. Because of this I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement 
about these loans. And, for the avoidance of doubt, given the evidence I have, I dont 
disagree with what the adjudicator said about loans 1 to 6 and LaHs offer about loans 83 
and 84. 
So, I wont comment in depth about this lending. I have included the offer LaH made in my 
putting things right section below. And loans 1 to 6 were part of the borrowing relationship 
Ms B had with LaH. So, they are something I will take into account when considering the 
other loans she took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 7 to 82 because I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of LaHs lending 
history with Ms B, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which LaH should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so LaH should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Ms Bs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
At this point LaH ought to have realised Ms B was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. Ms B had taken out 7 loans within 15 months. These loans were 
intended to be longer term arrangements, so this was a significant number. And 
whilst the loan amounts werent always high this points to a continuing, and frequent, 
need for money.  
So LaH ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms Bs indebtedness was 
unsustainable. And that she was likely using these loans to make ends meet. 
Ms Bs first loan was for £200 and loan 7 was for £250. But as I said earlier, Ms B 
was taking a significant number of loans over shorter timeframes. So, her 
indebtedness at times was high. At loan 7 she still hadnt repaid loans 4, 5 and 6. At 
this point LaH ought to have known that Ms B was not likely borrowing to meet 
shorter term problems with her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Right from the start Ms B was provided with a new loan within a short time of settling 
a previous one. And she often had more than one loan running at the same time. 
Ms B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed LaH. Loan 84 was 
taken out around 9 years after Ms Bs first. And it was for a larger amount. This is a 
very long time to be using this type of credit. Ms B had paid large amounts of interest 
to, in effect, service a debt to LaH over an extended period.
I think that Ms B lost out because LaH continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Bs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the number of loans, and the length of time over which Ms B borrowed, was likely to 
have had negative implications on Ms Bs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 7 to 84 and LaH should put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress LaH should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms B from loan 7, as Im satisfied it ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Ms B may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between her and this particular lender which she may not have had with others. If this wasnt 
a viable option, she may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that, 
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how she would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Ms B in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Ms B would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce LaHs liability in this case for what Im satisfied it 
has done wrong and should put right.
LaH shouldnt have given Ms B loans 7 to 84.
If LaH has sold the outstanding debts LaH should buy these back if it is able to do so and 
then take the following steps. If LaH is not able to buy the debts back then LaH should liaise 
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A) LaH should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms B towards interest, fees 
and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything it 
has already refunded.
B) LaH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms B which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms B originally made the payments, 
to the date the complaint is settled.
C) LaH should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Ms B as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Ms B having made 
overpayments then LaH should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. LaH should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B 
and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus 
then the surplus should be paid to Ms B. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then LaH should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Ms B. LaH shouldnt pursue 
outstanding balances made up of principal LaH has already written-off.
E) The overall pattern of Ms Bs borrowing for loans 7 to 84 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Ms Bs credit file. LaH 
does not have to remove loans 83 and 84 from Ms Bs credit file until these have been 
repaid, but LaH should still remove any adverse information recorded about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LaH to deduct tax from this interest. LaH should give Ms 
B a certificate showing how much tax LaH has deducted if she asks for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Ms Bs complaint.
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 February 2022.
