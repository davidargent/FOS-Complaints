The complaint
Ms W is complaining that AvantCredit of UK, LLC irresponsibly lent to her.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision. 
Avantcredit hasnt responded to the adjudicators view and so I dont know what its 
disagreement with the adjudicators assessment may be.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the adjudicator for these reasons:
AvantCredits checks didnt go far enough and it should have taken its checks further. 
I say this because based on what AvantCredit saw from its credit checks, it should 
have been concerned that Ms W was likely reliant on credit and this should have 
prompted it to verify some of the information.
Had AvantCredit carried out what I consider to be sufficient checks, it would have 
found that Ms W was borrowing from several other lenders and was gambling 
significantly when she borrowed from it. This wasnt a sustainable position.
On this basis, I have concluded that AvantCredit shouldnt have lent the loan to Ms W 
and it needs to put things right.
Putting things right
Remove all interest, fees and charges applied to the loan.
Treat any payments made by Ms W as payments towards the capital amount of 
Â£3,700,
If Ms W has paid more than the capital then any overpayments should be refunded to 
with 8%* simple interest from the date they were paid to the date of settlement,
But if theres still an outstanding balance, AvantCredit should come to a reasonable 
repayment plan with Ms W.
Remove any adverse information about the loan from Ms Ws credit file.
If AvantCredit has sold the debt, it needs to ensure that Ms W is redressed in line 
with the above recommendations.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to take off tax from this interest. AvantCredit must 
give Ms W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold Ms Ws complaint and direct AvantCredit of UK, LLC to put things right as set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 April 2022.
