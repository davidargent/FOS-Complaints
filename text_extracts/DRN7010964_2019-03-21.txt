K821x#15complaint
Mr W says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent QuickQuid and Mr W my provisional decision on this complaint on 7 March 2019. A 
copy of it is attached and it forms part of this final decision. The full background to the 
complaint is set out in it, so I wont reiterate that here.
I asked both parties to let me know if they had anything to add. Mr W said he didnt have 
anything to add. QuickQuid provided some  further points for me to consider.  So Ive 
considered those  and everything else already provided  below.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have also taken into account the law, 
any relevant regulatory  rules and good  industry practice at the time.
Im afraid I dont think the points QuickQuid have raised in response  to my provisional 
decision are new  the information  is already something Ive seen and considered.  
QuickQuid has again essentially  said it considers  the affordability checks  it carried out for 
loans 7 and 8 were  proportionate. I explained why I didnt think they were  in my provisional 
decision:
By the time of loans  7 and 8, Mr W had been borrowing from QuickQuid, without significant 
breaks, for around ten months. The amounts he was borrowing did fluctuate, but I think  the 
pattern of repeat lending alone ought  to have  been enough to cause QuickQuid concern. 
The way in which Mr W was borrowing was indicative of financial difficulty and so I think  it 
wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid to carry out a full review  of his income and 
outgoings before deciding  whether to lend further.
QuickQuid hasnt addressed this point directly, or provided new information. So my finding 
doesnt change.
QuickQuid didnt address  the points Id made about what proportionate checks  wouldve 
shown at all. So again, Ive nothing  different  to say on this subject.
Having been given no new information  to consider,  my final decision is the same as my 
provisional decision, for the same reasons.
Ref: DRN70109642putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 7 and 8
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when they were  paid until the 
date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  loans 7 and 8 from Mr Ws credit  history
HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 April 2019.

Mr W says CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr W had eight loans with QuickQuid  Ive set out some of the information QuickQuid provided  about 
the loans in the table  below. Loan 3 was topped up twice (3a and 3b); this means  further funds were  
approved for Mr W during the course of the loan agreement.

An adjudicator considered this complaint and recommended it be upheld in respect of loans 3a-4 as 
well as 7 and 8. QuickQuid  didnt agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed  to me to 
decide. As theres been no further dispute about loans  1-3, 5 or 6, my decision will only be about 
loans 3a, 3b, 4, 7 and 8  unless Mr W has further comments  to make.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. I have also taken into account the law, any relevant  regulatory  rules 
and good industry practice at the time.
In response to the adjudicators view, QuickQuid said:
Thank you for providing your assessment of Mr [Ws] complaint. I have attached the entire lending  
process including all the checks that we perform prior to lending, the screenshots  of customer 
applications, as well as the sample acknowledgement  from the contract  that customers  have to check 
when their repayment  amount is greater than their estimated disposable income.  Therefore, we do not 
agree that Mr [W] should  not have been provided with the top ups on loan 3 and loans 4, 7, and 8. 
Please review the additional information attached and provide  us with your thoughts, we look forward 
to your response.
QuickQuid didnt comment  on our adjudicators case-specific findings about the proportionality of its 
checks or the affordability of the loan, nor did it provide any new information  for me to consider. This 
Service has responded to QuickQuid on the above generic argument directly  and through earlier final 
decisions. So I am not going  to address this point here, though I have considered it alongside 
everything else in making my decision. 
Ref: DRN70109644I would remind QuickQuid at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance in how 
complaints are to be dealt  with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In particular  DISP 
1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result  of determinations  by the Ombudsman are effectively  applied 
in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination  by the Ombudsman to the individuals  in the respondent who handled 
the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman  concerning complaints received 
by the respondent and using this in training and development  of the individuals dealing with 
complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance  produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals  dealing with complaints in the 
respondent.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Ws complaint and what  both parties have said about  
this.
The FCA was the regulator  at the time Mr W borrowed the loans in question. Bearing  in mind  the rules 
and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit Sourcebook 
(CONC), I would expect a lenders affordability assessment to vary with circumstance. (I am not 
quoting the specific regulations here because, as before, I would expect QuickQuid to be conversant 
with these  through previous  ombudsman decisions, particularly recent decisions, which  set these  out 
in detail.) 
In general, Id expect a lender to require  more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id expect  a 
lender to seek more  assurance by carrying out more detailed checks:
the higher the loan amount,
the lower the consumers income; or
the longer the lending relationship.
I understand that for all of the loans,  except loan 8, Mr Ws declared income  was recorded as £1,808 
net a month.  This increased to £1,917 for loan 8. QuickQuid also recorded information about  Mr Ws 
monthly expenditure; the total recorded was £625 for loans  3a and 3b, £727 for loan 4 and £775  for 
loans 7 and 8. The expenditure total included  figures  for credit commitments of £50-£150. Based on 
what Mr W declared, hed have disposable income in the region of £1,100 a month.
However, QuickQuid  used  an estimate for Mr Ws monthly  disposable income  (EDI), which  was 
influenced by other factors including credit reference agency data. It hasnt shared any credit  
reference agency data with us but has provided the EDI figures for each loan:
3a/3b   £695
4  £483
7  £324.50
8  £448.25
So the loans Im looking  at have been subject to significant  further adjustments beyond a simple 
deduction. But without  seeing the details of what caused QuickQuid to revise  Mr Ws disposable  
income downwards, its not possible for me to say whether QuickQuid carried out proportionate 
checks when arriving at the EDI figures above.
Ref: DRN70109645As I dont know how QuickQuid arrived  at the EDI figures, Ive considered what I think a proportionate 
checks wouldve shown,  taking into account  information about  Mr Ws income and regular expenditure 
(as declared to QuickQuid), as well as the evidence Ive seen  of his short-term debt and other 
financial circumstances at the time.
loans 3a, 3b and 4
Loans 3a and 3b were  the fourth and fifth advances approved for Mr W in the space of about  three 
months. Together, they increased the size of the largest payment on loan 3 to about £500. Loan 4 
had a lower  largest  repayment  of £444.80, but it was approved in the same  month loan 3 ended.
This pattern of relatively frequent borrowing can often  arise when a borrower  isnt able to settle their 
debts sustainably.  Given  that Mr W had so many  advances in a relatively short  space of time,  I think 
QuickQuid ought to have had some  concerns about this and made  sure it had enough information to 
understand all of his outgoings, including making  sure it understood what he owed other short-term 
lenders (if anything). While  I appreciate QuickQuid provided the above EDI figures, these dont, on 
their own, show me if or how it made adjustments for any short-term credit commitments it found out 
about from its credit  checks.
So Ive looked at all the evidence  I have  to see if proportionate checks  wouldve suggested the loans 
were unaffordable. Mr Ws bank statements for January 2017 dont show that he received loans from 
any other short-term lenders in the period  before loans 3a and 3b were approved. 
I think  this means its likely  proportionate checks wouldnt have shown  anything substantially different 
from what QuickQuid actually found out.
I therefore  dont think proportionate checks wouldve suggested loans  3a/3b were unaffordable  for
Mr W and dont intend  to uphold the complaint about these loans.
In respect of loan 4, Ive seen that Mr W took out four other  short-term  loans (from  other lenders) 
between 10 March  and 22 March 2017.  Loan 4 commenced on 31 March 2017.  Given  the very close 
proximity of these other loans to the fourth QuickQuid loan, I dont think I can say, on balance,  that 
QuickQuid would have been aware  of them, had it carried out proportionate checks. This means  Im 
not persuaded  that proportionate checks wouldve  shown  anything  very different to what QuickQuid 
actually found out before approving loan 4. So I dont think QuickQuid wouldve seen information to 
suggest that this loan was unaffordable. Im therefore not planning to uphold the complaint about  loan 
4.
loans 7 and 8
By the time of loans 7 and 8, Mr W had been borrowing  from QuickQuid, without significant breaks, 
for around ten months. The amounts he was borrowing  did fluctuate, but I think the pattern  of repeat 
lending alone ought to have been  enough  to cause QuickQuid concern. The way in which Mr W was 
borrowing was indicative  of financial difficulty and so I think it wouldve been proportionate for 
QuickQuid to carry out a full review of his income and outgoings before deciding whether to lend 
further. QuickQuid  didnt  do this, so in the absence of any other information, Ive taken into account  
information from Mr Ws bank statements.
In the period shortly  before  loans 7 and 8, Ive seen that Mr W was spending relatively large 
(compared to his income) amounts on gambling   around £800 in July 2017 and significantly more  in 
August. I have noted one large win in August 2017 but Ive also seen that this money was largely, if 
not entirely, spent again in the same  month.
Ive also looked at Mr Ws other short-term commitments and have seen that in the month before 
loans 7 and 8, hed taken out around £2,500 of loans from other short-term  lenders. I cant be sure 
QuickQuid wouldve seen information about all of this other  debt  but I think  proportionate checks 
wouldve revealed  most  of it.
Ref: DRN70109646Given the overall level of Mr Ws monthly expenditure  and his broader financial circumstances at the 
time, I think proportionate checks wouldve shown QuickQuid that loans 7 and 8 were  not sustainably 
affordable for him. Im therefore planning to uphold his complaint about them.
putting things  right
I currently think QuickQuid should:
refund the interest and charges Mr W paid on loans  7 and 8
add to the above  interest at 8% simple  per year, from when they were paid until the date of 
settlement
remove any adverse  information about loans 7 and 8 from Mr Ws credit  history
HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
