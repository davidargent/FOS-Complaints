The complaint
Miss G has complained that NewDay Ltd hasnt treated her fairly as a vulnerable consumer, 
and as a result she accrued more debt on her credit card account.
What happened
Miss G opened her account in March 2017, and between April and October 2019 Miss G 
says it was apparent she had a gambling problem. She feels NewDay let her down during 
this period of time by failing to identify that she was a vulnerable consumer or offer the 
support she required. Miss G feels once she had complained to NewDay and made them 
aware of how vulnerable she was, the service they provided was unsatisfactory and it didnt 
do what it said it would do. As a result, she would like NewDay to write off the outstanding 
balance on her credit card and close the account. She would also like all interest and 
charges that were applied between April 2019 to October 2019 to be refunded.
NewDay has said that between March 2017 and April 2019 Miss G was using her card for 
retail purchases. However, after April 2019, the account was being used for cash advances 
and gambling transactions. But NewDay says it wasnt made aware of Miss Gs gambling 
problem until November 2019.
NewDay says that once it was made aware of Miss Gs gambling problem on 
8 November 2019, it agreed to look into her complaint. It also referred her complaint to the 
customer care team, who tried to contact Miss G on 12 November 2019. As it was unable to 
get hold of Miss G, it sent a contact us letter. However, NewDay has said, given the nature 
of Miss Gs call on 8 November, where she explained how vulnerable she felt, it should have 
done more to contact her. 
Miss G spoke to NewDay on 3 December 2019. NewDay offered details for step change and 
gamble aware, but Miss G advised she was already receiving support. New Day also offered 
repayment options, but Miss G didnt want to commit to a payment plan until she had 
received a response to her complaint.
Originally NewDay issued a final response on 9 December 2019, not upholding Miss Gs 
complaint. Miss G contacted NewDay again on 17 December 2019 and it agreed to a 
vulnerable block being put on her account and a partial refund.
Unfortunately, the partial refund was not actioned, so Miss G had to contact NewDay on 
several occasions by telephone and email. NewDay accepted this was not adequate service 
and offered Miss G £25 for the trouble and upset it caused.
Miss G remained unhappy with NewDays response, so she brought her complaint to our 
service.
Since then NewDay has also refunded 50% of the interest charged between April to October 
2019 and refunded a £12 fee.
Our investigator looked into Miss Gs complaint and while he did feel NewDay hadnt 
provided a satisfactory level of service, he felt that NewDay had done enough to put things 
right. Miss G didnt agree.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the investigators findings for broadly the same reasons. I will 
explain why.
Miss G opened her account in March 2017. Between March 2017 and March 2019, I am 
satisfied that Miss G largely operated the credit card in line with the terms and conditions of 
the account. Therefore, I will focus my decision on the events that occurred after 
March 2019.
Miss G is unhappy with the charges and interest applied to her account in respect of the 
gambling transactions; and the lack of support NewDay provided in relation to her gambling 
problem. However, the charges appear to have been applied in line with the terms and 
conditions of her account. So, I dont think NewDay has made an error, procedurally, by 
applying these. What is left for me to decide is whether I think NewDay has acted positively 
and sympathetically once it became aware of Miss Gs financial hardship caused by her 
gambling problem.
NewDay does have a responsibility to ensure it treats a consumer positively and 
sympathetically if they become aware the consumer is experiencing financial difficulties. 
However, it is the account holders responsibility to inform the lender if they are experiencing 
financial difficulties. Miss G says she contacted NewDay early on when her problem began. 
NewDay says it doesnt have any call records to show this. I have reviewed the evidence 
Miss G has provided, and it is clear that she did make contact with NewDay on 18 April 2019 
(12 minute call), 27 May 2019 (2 minute call), 15 July 2019 (6 minute call) and 
October 2019. So, it is disappointing that NewDay couldnt provide more information 
regarding the contact that was made on these occasions. Never the less, I can see Miss G 
did make contact with NewDay during this period of time.
However, I have also considered what Miss G has said in her complaint to our service. She 
states that while she did contact NewDay early on, it was to notify them that she didnt 
recognise numerous transactions on her statement to a gambling company. As such, I cant 
see any evidence to suggest that Miss G told NewDay prior to 8 November 2019 that she 
had a gambling problem. Therefore, on balance, I am not satisfied that NewDay was aware 
Miss G had a gambling problem. 
It isnt NewDays responsibility to tell an account holder what they can and cant spend 
money on, or to monitor transactions and make unsolicited recommendations about how 
money is being spent. So, although Miss Gs statements show that between April 2019 and 
December 2019 her spending shifted to cash advances and gambling transactions, I dont 
think that alone is enough to say that NewDay needed to do more or shouldve limited 
Miss Gs spending. 
Having reviewed the statements, I can see during this period of time Miss Gs credit limit was 
£6,000. She exceeded the agreed limit in July 2019 by £68 and brought the account back 
within the limit the following month. In October 2019 Miss G exceeded the agreed limit again 
and it wasnt bought back within the limit before December 2019 when the account was 
suspended. Therefore, Miss G largely operated her account within the terms and conditions of the 
account until October 2019. And so, I dont think there was anything to suggest, Miss G was 
experiencing financial hardship prior to this point. On the occasions when Miss G did exceed 
her limit, NewDay has shown that it wrote to Miss G about this. The letters gave contact 
details for Miss G to get in touch if she was having difficulty making payments. Ive 
considered whether NewDay shouldve done more than this at that point. But from the 
statements Ive seen, each time the account exceeded its limit, payments were made to 
bring it back within its limit. I cant say this was enough to warrant NewDay investigating 
Miss Gs spending pattern on her account without Miss G advising NewDay she was 
experiencing financial hardship. 
I am satisfied that Miss G did make NewDay aware of her challenges in November 2019. At 
this point I can see that Miss Gs complaint was referred to the customer care team, which is 
what I would have expected given the nature of Miss Gs call. I appreciate the customer care 
team tried to contact Miss G, but I agree that at this stage, NewDay should have done more 
to reach out to Miss G and to promptly act in a positive and sympathetic manner. It wasnt 
until roughly a month later that Miss G was offered a payment plan and provided with contact 
details of step change and gamble aware. 
I feel NewDay could have been more proactive with offering support to Miss G and ensuring 
she was treated in line with its vulnerable customer policy. However, I accept that New day 
did acknowledge this and took steps to rectify the issue. Miss G had a vulnerable block put 
on her account, and a block put on to stop further fees accruing. NewDay also refunded 
interest and charges from when it was made aware of the difficulties Miss G was 
experiencing, to December 2019. It also offered Miss G £25 as a gesture of goodwill. 
Therefore, while I accept NewDay didnt act as promptly as it should have, I am satisfied that 
it has now acted positively and sympathetically to Miss Gs circumstances as it should have 
done when it was made aware in November 2019. 
The service Miss G has received has been unsatisfactory. NewDay delayed making the 
adjustments it promised, didnt proactively contact Miss G once her complaint had been 
passed to the customer care team and didnt respond to Miss Gs emails when she was 
chasing why the adjustments hadnt been made and raising further points for it to consider. 
In recognition of this, NewDay also refunded 50% of interest charged between April to 
October 2019, which I think is fair given the fact NewDay was unaware of Miss Gs 
circumstances at that point. 
In summary, I accept this was a very difficult time for Miss G and I am empathetic to her 
circumstances. But taking everything into account, I cant reasonably say NewDay acted 
unreasonably prior to November 2019. The charges and interest were applied to her account 
correctly. And I dont think the operation of the account meant that NewDay should have 
intervened before Miss G made it aware of her gambling problem. However, I do accept 
more could have been done by NewDay once it was made aware, but I feel NewDay has 
done enough to put things right and has acted positively and sympathetically to Miss Gs 
complaint. So, I wont be asking NewDay to do anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 September 2021.
