These loans were set up to be repaid on a weekly basis. 
Mrs F and her representative have said that STF failed to carry out reasonable and 
proportionate checks. They argue that had STF done so it wouldve seen that Mrs F was 
already experiencing financial difficulties and that it wasnt responsible to lend to her. 
STF addressed the 29 most recent loans (loans 7-36). It argued that it completed 
proportionate checks before agreeing 27 of these loans, including asking Mrs F for her 
income and expenditure declarations and completing a credit search. STF upheld Mrs Fs 
complaint in relation to loans 35 and 36. 
Unhappy with STFs response, Mrs F referred her complaint to our service. An adjudicator 
initially considered some of the loans and during this investigation established that STF had 
lent Mrs F 36 loans. STF didnt consent to us considering loans 1-7 as it felt Mrs F 
complained outside the time limits needed to raise a complaint. This was considered by the 
adjudicator and then subsequently an ombudsman (when STF didnt agree with adjudicators 
findings.) Both the adjudicator and ombudsman agreed that Mrs F did raise her complaint 
about these loans in time. 
The merits of Mrs Fs complaint was then re-considered by the adjudicator. The adjudicator 
upheld Mrs Fs complaint from loan 6 onwards. She felt that given the frequency of the 
loans, by loan 6, Mrs F had established a pattern of lending with STF and STF shouldve 
realised the lending was unsustainable for her. 
Mrs F agreed with the adjudicators assessment.
STF disagreed with the adjudicators assessment arguing it adhered to relevant guidelines 
and regulations, together with good industry practice that was applicable at the time. As an 
agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to consider. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs F could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and Mrs Fs 
income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I 
think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that STF should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that STF was required to establish 
whether Mrs F could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Fs complaint. As Mrs F has accepted the 
adjudicators assessment, this decision will consider loans 6 to 34 (loans 35 and 36 have 
already been upheld by STF). 
STF has said it completed a number of checks before agreeing to lend to Mrs F. From 2014 
onwards it has it took information about Mrs Fs circumstances such as her marital status 
and employment status. It also asked her to self-declare her income and expenditure, 
completed a credit search and said it verified her income. In addition, its said it reviewed her 
previous repayment history with it before agreeing a subsequent loan. 
From August 2018 onwards, STF has said it also completed further checks by comparing the 
declarations made to ONS data and increasing the declarations accordingly if ONS averages 
were higher. It has also said it verified income and expenditure using bank statements and 
any other relevant proofs required. STF has provided copies of application forms from loan 
8 onwards. In the more recent loans STF has said it switched to online applications and so 
has provided a copy of the income and expenditure information Mrs F provided, together 
with its calculations of her disposable income. It has also provided some limited information 
for a small number of the credit searches it completed. 
Ive thought carefully about the checks STF completed. Firstly, its not provided anything to 
evidence the checks its said it carried out for loans 6 and 7. However, this isnt entirely 
unreasonable given how long ago the loans were agreed. 
For loan 8 onwards, whilst its provided application forms or summaries of the information 
declared during the application process, it hasnt evidenced that it verified the information 
Mrs F had declared. Given STF had been lending to Mrs F consistently for a year by the time 
of loan 6, there were only days between applications and the amounts were steadily 
increasing, I think STF needed to take additional steps to verify the information being 
provided. And as Ive explained I cant see it did this, so I dont think STF did complete 
proportionate checks before agreeing to lend. 
However, given the circumstances of this complaint, I dont think I need to go on to consider 
what proportionate checks wouldve most likely shown. This is because I think STF 
shouldve realised that the overall pattern of lending was harmful and it shouldnt have 
continued to lend from loan 6 onwards. 
By the time of loan 6 STF had been lending to Mrs F consistently for around a year. In 
addition, she had very limited gaps in lending with a few days being the longest gap. As Mrs F regularly came back to STF very quickly for additional borrowing, this shows a level of 
dependency. 
The amounts being lent had also steadily increased from £100 (plus interest) for loan 1 to 
four times as much (plus interest) by the time of loan 4 and 5. So during this period from May 
2013 to May 2014, her indebtedness with STF had increased significantly and at no point did 
her circumstances stabilise to the point where she didnt need to continue to borrow from 
STF. I think this shouldve indicated to STF that Mrs F was becoming reliant on this type of 
credit and it shouldnt have continued to lend to her.
STF did continue to lend to Mrs F and including loan 6 it lent a further 31 loans (excluding 
loans 35 and 36.) These loans were lent over a period of five and a half years and during 
this time the longest gap in lending was around a week. In the majority of examples, a new 
loan was agreed on the same day a previous loan was repaid (suggesting Mrs F was 
consolidating one loan into a new one) and some loans overlapped with an existing loan. In 
addition, I can also see examples where Mrs F was able to apply for an additional loan on 
the same day that shed taken a previous one. 
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Fs indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive credit, intended for short-term use, over an extended period of time. The 
number of loans and the length of time over which Mrs F borrowed was likely to have had 
negative implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans
Taking everything into consideration, I think these loans increased Mrs Fs indebtedness in a 
way which was unsustainable and harmful and as such I dont think STF shouldnt have 
given Mrs F any of loans 6 to 34. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Mrs F from loan 6, as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs F may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that, 
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Mrs F in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mrs F would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right. Taking all this into consideration, I think the 
following is fair compensation. 
For loans which have been upheld (loans 6 to 34) and the two loans STF previously upheld 
(loans 35 and 36), STF should:  
refund all interest and charges Mrs F paid on these loans;pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
Remove all entries from Mrs Fs credit file. Ive upheld this complaint because I think 
the volume and frequency of these loans was harmful to Mrs F. Therefore, any 
information about these loans recorded on her credit file about them is harmful.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to take off tax from this interest. STF must give 
Mrs F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mrs Fs complaint and direct Short Term Finance 
Limited to put things right in the way Ive detailed above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2021.
