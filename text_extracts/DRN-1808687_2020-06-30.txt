The complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt raise a chargeback 
claim in relation to payments he made for trading purposes. 
What happened
Between 9 May 2019 and August 2019 Mr P made payments totalling Â£9,250 to two different 
businesses that offered trading services. Mr P has explained that the merchants should have 
put his money into a segregated trading account but didnt. Mr P asked NatWest to raise a 
chargeback claim to help get his money back. Mr P also explained that neither of the 
businesses hed made debit card payments to was regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority. 
NatWest asked Mr P to send it evidence to show his funds hadnt been placed in a 
segregated trading account. NatWest wanted to obtain evidence that the service hadnt been 
provided as Mr P claimed. NatWest requested evidence from Mr P on 27 November 2019 
and again on 27 December 2019. 
NatWest says Mr P didnt send it the evidence it asked for so it didnt raise a claim as there 
was little prospect it would be successful. 
Mr P complained and NatWest responded on 15 January 2020. NatWest said that as Mr P 
didnt provide the evidence it asked for it wasnt able to raise a chargeback. Mr P referred his 
complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. They thought NatWest had 
dealt with Mr Ps complaint fairly and didnt ask it to do anything else. Mr P asked to appeal 
so his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reviewed the Visa chargeback scheme rules as quoted by Mr P and NatWest. Mr P says 
the chargeback rules dont required NatWest to request evidence that the merchant didnt 
provide the agreed service. But the chargeback scheme rules do say that the business 
raising the dispute should provide supporting documentation to show the services were not 
rendered. Im satisfied NatWests request for further information to support Mr Ps 
chargeback was reasonable. 
During a call with NatWest, Mr Ps representative said the account was showing a negative 
balance. So it does appear Mr P was able to view some information in relation to his trading 
account with one of the businesses he tried to raise a claim against.
DRN-1808687As both NatWest and the investigator have said, Visa sets the chargeback rules. I wouldnt 
expect NatWest to raise a chargeback dispute that it didnt think had any prospect of 
success. And without the information it requested I think NatWests decision not to take Mr 
Ps chargeback dispute further was reasonable. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr P but I havent been persuaded that NatWest made a mistake 
when it declined to dispute the payments he made. 
As I'm satisfied NatWest's decision to decline Mr P's chargeback claim was reasonable and 
that it has dealt with this complaint fairly, I'm not telling it to take any further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 July 2020.
