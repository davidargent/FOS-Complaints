Miss W complains Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) made mistakes after she deposited 
£300 cash into her account on 17 January 2018.
background
On 17 January 2018 Miss W deposited  £300  into her account with Barclays.  It was later 
(mistakenly) thought by Barclays that shed withdrawn rather  than deposited the money on 
that day. Miss W complained to Barclays but was unhappy with their response so she 
brought her concerns  to us.
In their Final  Response Letter (FRL) of 6 February 2019 Barclays  told Miss W when she 
went to withdraw £300.00  from her account on 17 January 2019 it was credited with £300.00 
rather than debited for the withdrawal. Barclays said when this was raised they applied 
safeguards  namely a Branch Transaction Log marker (BTL) to her account in order for 
this to be rectified. And they said this left Miss Ws account with an overdrawn available  
balance. But - as theyd told Miss W in the telephone conversation on the day before - the 
marker on her account should be corrected by 11 February 2019 and her available account  
balance should  also be corrected. They also told her that in respect  of the payment of 
£14.99 to a third party - which shed previously asked them to stop but had debited  her 
account on 19 December  2018 - theyd  put a stop to any future payments to this merchant.
Barclays apologised to Miss W that shed had cause  to complain and said, as agreed during 
the telephone conversation on 5 February 2019,  they would credit her account with £300.00 
for the distress and inconvenience caused  and also to cover  the amount her account been 
left in debit after the transaction on 17 January 2019  and £14.99  to cover the transaction  
which debited her account but shouldve  been cancelled. 
Our investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. She found Barclays  had now acknowledged  
they were incorrect when stating Miss W made a withdrawal instead of a deposit on 17 
January 2018  and repeating this in the FRL. But she thought,  in light of everything, Barclays  
payment of £300  as a gesture of goodwill was fair and reasonable. And the investigator 
thought that when the BTL marker  was removed, Miss Ws account  was put back into the 
position it would've been in if it hadn't been applied in the first place.
Miss W didnt agree  with the outcome and asked to take the case  further.  She was 
concerned that no one understood  shed lost money  as a result  of Barclays mistake.  And 
that remained the case after the investigator  had sent a further  letter with annotated copies 
of her statements explaining the movements  on the account.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the view this 
is a complaint which I cannot uphold. Ill explain why.
The investigator has given a full summary of the background to this complaint in her letter  
giving her opinion  and the further view with details about the movements on the account. I 
agree with the investigators overall analysis and the conclusions shes reached. And, 
although I think the investigator covered  most points quite clearly,  I think it would be helpful if 
I expanded on some of the points shes made.
Ref: DRN40386302Im not surprised Miss W brought her complaint  to us. Ive found the correspondence and 
some of the records from Barclays contradictory  and confusing.  In particular the FRL which -
despite assuring  Miss W that the marker  applied to her account will be removed and the 
account balance  corrected - repeats the mistake that Miss W withdrew  money rather  than 
depositing it. The FRL is also unclear when explaining the payment of £300 which is referred  
to as being both for the distress and inconvenience caused and also to cover the amount 
this has left you in debit after the  transaction.  I appreciate all of this will have been 
confusing, frustrating and a concern for Miss W. And Ive taken  into account that it wasnt  
until some  way into our investigation - on 27 February 2019  - that Barclays  accepted  Miss W 
deposited the £300 rather than withdrawing  it. 
Although the initial letter  Barclays sent to Miss W on 28 January  2019 was mistaken about 
the transactions on the account,  I do think it contains a clearer  explanation of their proposed  
action on the account. It said on 17/01/2019 when you made your cash  withdrawalwe 
paid £300.00 into your account instead of removing £300.00at  the moment there  is an 
outstanding amount of £600.00Based  on the above, weve  put a hold on £600.00 in your 
account which will be unavailable to spend.  In 14 calendar days  we will remove the £600.00  
which means that your account will be back as it should be. If you feel this is a mistake  and 
the amount paid in was correct, please contact us within the 14 days. Miss W complained 
the same  day and spoke  to the bank on 5 February 2019 which resulted in the FRL. Despite 
the confused content of the FRL,  it seems  to me, from all the evidence, that Barclays 
accepted Miss Ws explanation and removed the BTL marker so the available balance was 
restored. The £600 was never  debited  from her account.
Im satisfied the account statements -  most particularly  that dated  5 February 2019 covering 
the period from 5 January  to 5 February  2019 - show  the true and correct  position on the 
account. The statements  show  the £600  Barclays proposed to remove - the subject of the 
temporary BTL marker - was never taken. They also show the original £300 deposit  crediting 
the day it was paid in by Miss W on 17 January  2019 and a credit  showing the £314.99 
compensation was paid in on 5 February 2019.
Miss W has referred to other payments  coming  into the account - she told us shed received 
money from the government and also paid £300  in and her balance was over £200. She also 
said the recall of £600 left her overdrawn and Barclays refund of £314 brought  her back into 
the black. But she queried where  the £219   which she said was her original balance in the 
first place - had gone. I can see there  have  been  a number of credits to the account. But 
theres also been expenditure by Miss W after the deposit on 17 January 2019 up and until 
the 28 January  2019 when the available balance was temporarily reduced by £600 in the 
BTL marker.  But this marker  was removed and theres no evidence of any money being 
removed from her account by Barclays. In fact the overall account balance has increased by
the amount of £314.99 which Barclays have now clarified a represents  £300 for the distress 
and inconvenience  caused by both the application  of the BTL marker and because Miss W 
was without a card whilst  abroad. And £14.99 refund for a transaction  which  should  have 
been cancelled.  I can see Barclays also later refunded an unpaid  item fee of £8 in respect  of 
a direct debit which was returned unpaid  when Miss Ws account was impacted by the 
temporary BTL marker and the available balance  was overdrawn.
By reversing  the £600 BTL marker  and refunding the unpaid item fee the account is back  in 
the position it was before the mistake was made. So I cant  agree that Miss W has suffered 
any loss. But theres no doubt shes been  inconvenienced by this mistake and I can 
understand its caused her some concern. But in respect of this I think the compensation 
offered of £300  is a reasonable response. So I dont require Barclays  to do anything  further.
Ref: DRN40386303my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 14 March 2020.
