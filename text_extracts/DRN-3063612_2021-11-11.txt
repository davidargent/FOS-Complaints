The complaint
Mrs M complains that a car that was supplied to her under a conditional sale agreement with 
Moneybarn No. 1 Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mrs M under a conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn that 
she signed in October 2019. She contacted Moneybarn about an issue with the wheel 
bearings in November 2019 and said that the car hadnt been properly inspected before it 
was supplied to her. The issue with the wheel bearings was repaired by the dealer. 
Moneybarn agreed a payment holiday with Mrs M in April 2020 and when that ended she 
complained to it about issues with the boot locking mechanism and the handbrake. 
It said that there was no evidence to show that there was an inherent or developing issue 
with the cars boot locking mechanism or handbrake at the point of sale and that Mrs M was 
unable to substantiate those claims so it was unable to uphold her complaint. Mrs M wasnt 
satisfied with its response so complained to this service and stopped making payments to 
Moneybarn. She says that she can no longer use the car because of her disabilities and 
wants to reject it.
Moneybarn then said that it would pay for the cost of investigating and, if appropriate, 
repairing the fault with the boot locking mechanism if Mrs M provided it with a diagnostic 
report and a quote for the work from a VAT registered garage. It said that it would credit her 
account with £99 as a goodwill gesture to recognise the potential lack of a 99 point check at 
the point of sale and £243.58 as a reimbursement of one monthly payment for her lack of 
use of the car when the car was repaired in November 2019. It also said that it would pay 
her £150 to recognise the distress and inconvenience caused as a result of these matters.
Our investigator didnt feel that the car was of unsatisfactory quality so he couldnt ask 
Moneybarn to end the agreement and collect the car. He felt that the settlement to repair the 
car and the offer made by Moneybarn was fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint. He said that Moneybarn has a responsibility to record a true and accurate 
reflection of a customers repayment history but he would ask if Moneybarn would be 
prepared to remove the negative information should Mrs M accept the settlement, but it 
hasnt responded to that request.
Mrs M didnt accept that offer and has asked for her complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. She says, in summary, that Moneybarn has admitted that the 99 point check 
wasnt completed and she complained about that in November 2019 so the car was mis-sold 
to her and she should be able to reject it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
Moneybarn, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mrs M - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mrs M was about four years old, had been driven for 
71,878 miles and had a price of £7,860;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car was supplied to Mrs M in October 2019 and she complained to Moneybarn in 
November 2019 about an issue with a wheel bearing and that the car hadnt been 
properly inspected before it was supplied to her  the issue with the wheel bearing 
was repaired by the dealer later that month; 
Moneybarns contact notes show that it discussed the payments on her account with 
her between November 2019 and July 2020 (and a payment holiday was agreed in 
April 2020) but Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs M complained to Moneybarn 
about an issue with the cars boot locking mechanism or its handbrake until July 2020 
(about nine months after the car was supplied to her);
if there had been issues with the cars boot locking mechanism or handbrake when 
the car was supplied to Mrs M, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to 
have complained to Moneybarn about those issues sooner than she did;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that there was an issue with 
the cars boot locking mechanism or handbrake that was present or developing when 
the car was supplied to Mrs M  but Moneybarn has said that it would pay for the 
cost of investigating and, if appropriate, repairing the fault with the boot locking 
mechanism if Mrs M provided it with a diagnostic report and a quote for the work from 
a VAT registered garage; 
Mrs M says that she was told that the car had had a 99 point check before it was 
supplied to her but that didnt happen so the car was mis-sold to her and that she 
should be able to reject the car;
Ive not seen any evidence to show that the car did have a 99 point check but it 
passed an MOT test in September 2019 and Im not persuaded that its likely that the 
issues with the car that shes complained about would have been identified if such 
checks had been completed - and the dealer has repaired the issue with the wheel 
bearing;
Mrs Ms says that her disabilities are worsening and that shes unable to use the car - 
I understand that she hasnt been able to drive the car for some time due to her 
disabilities, that she now qualifies for a mobility allowance and thinks that having an 
automatic car would be easier for her and I appreciate how upsetting and frustrating 
having a car that shes unable to drive must be for her - but she entered into a 
conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn in October 2019 and agreed to the car 
being supplied to her on the terms set out in the agreement and her disabilities 
worsening doesnt mean that shes able to end the agreement or reject the car;as well as its offer to investigate and repair the fault with the boot locking mechanism, 
Moneybarn said that it would credit Mrs Ms account with £99 as a goodwill gesture 
to recognise the potential lack of a 99 point check at the point of sale and £243.58 as 
a reimbursement of one monthly payment for her lack of use of the car when the car 
was repaired in November 2019, and that it would pay her £150 to recognise the 
distress and inconvenience caused as a result of these matters - it also agreed a 
payment holiday with Mrs M in April 2020;
I sympathise with Mrs M for the issues that shes had with the car, the other issues 
that shes described including her worsening disabilities and the financial difficulties 
that shes experienced, but Im not persuaded that the car was mis-sold to her or that 
it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Moneybarn to allow her to reject the 
car;
I consider that the offer that Moneybarn has made to Mrs M is fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of her complaint and I dont consider that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require it to take any other action in response to her complaint - 
but I suggest that Mrs M contacts Moneybarn to ask about her options for returning 
the car and ending the agreement; 
Mrs M stopped making payments to Moneybarn in April 2020 and it has recorded 
missed payments on her credit file  Mrs M had complained to this service but that 
didnt mean that she didnt have to continue make the payments to Moneybarn;
I consider that the adverse information that Moneybarn has recorded on her credit file 
is a true and accurate record of her payment history and Im not persuaded that it 
would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Moneybarn to 
remove that information; and
Moneybarn is required to respond to any financial difficulties that Mrs M is 
experiencing positively and sympathetically  it agreed to a payment holiday with her 
in April 2020  but I suggest that she also contacts Moneybarn about the arrears on 
her account and the monthly payments under the agreement and tries to agree an 
affordable repayment arrangement with it that take account of her financial 
difficulties.
Putting things right
Moneybarn has said that it will pay for the cost of investigating and, if appropriate, repairing 
the fault with the boot locking mechanism if Mrs M provides it with a diagnostic report and a 
quote for the work from a VAT registered garage. It has also said that it will credit her 
account with £99 as a goodwill gesture to recognise the potential lack of a 99 point check at 
the point of sale and £243.58 as a reimbursement of one monthly payment for her lack of 
use of the car when the car was repaired in November 2019. It has also said that it will pay 
her £150 to recognise the distress and inconvenience caused as a result of these matters. I 
consider that to be a fair and reasonable response to Mrs Ms complaint.
 
My final decision
My decision is that Moneybarn No. 1 Limited should: 
1. Pay for the cost of investigating and, if appropriate, repairing the fault with the boot 
locking mechanism if Mrs M provides it with a diagnostic report and a quote for the 
work from a VAT registered garage.
2. Credit a total of £342.58 to Mrs Ms account.3. Pay (not credit) £150 to Mrs M to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience 
that shes been caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2021.
