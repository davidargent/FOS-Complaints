K821x#15complaint
Ms B has complained about  a number of loans she took out through  a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Ms B says she was lent 
to irresponsibly and the loans caused her financial problems.
To keep  things simple,  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout  this decision.
background
We now know that Ms B took out some 47 instalment loans from Sunny between  June  2015  
and September  2018. Ive enclosed a summary of Ms Bs first 10 loans with Sunny, based 
on the information it provided to us. This can be found in the appendix at the end of this 
decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan number  6 onwards. Sunny  initially said it didnt agree with this and that 
it hadnt done anything wrong,  but it later made  an offer to settle the complaint. Ms B didnt 
agree to that, so the complaint has come  to me for an ombudsmans final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Ms Bs 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Ms B could repay all the loans she was given  in a sustainable manner. These  checks ought 
to have taken  into account a range of different  factors,  such as the amounts being lent, the 
total repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN82805752There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms B could sustainably repay the loans;  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Ms B could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Ms B. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern  of lending history  with 
a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loans 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ought not to 
be upheld. There doesnt appear to be any dispute  about that and Im not therefore going  to 
go into any detail about these loans. In my view, the major issue is what  happened at the 
point of loan 6 onwards. I think the emerging pattern of repeated lending from then would 
have looked different and therefore  required a more  thorough and responsible  approach. 
The overall pattern  of Sunnys lending  to Miss R, for example, should have caused it to see 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans from this point. 
Loan 6 was Ms Bs sixth short-term loan application  with Sunny in just over 9 months or so 
and was taken  out whilst  some other loans were still outstanding. So Sunny ought to have 
realised that Ms B wasnt merely  borrowing  to deal with short-term cash-flow problems; she 
was borrowing regularly,  to address  shortfalls  in her income and to meet an ongoing need. 
Ms B was having  to consistently  take out high interest, short-term  lending over a sustained 
period and the indebtedness caused  by this type of borrowing was harmful, in my view.  
Sunny should  have  seen  this and ought  to have realised Ms B was at risk of not managing to 
repay the loans  sustainably  or getting into financial  difficulties. 
So Im upholding  this complaint in respect of loans 6 - 47. Sunny repeatedly lent to Ms B in 
an unsustainable manner  because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Ms B borrowed was likely to have had negative  
implications on her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms B paid on loans 6 - 47;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
Ref: DRN82805753the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 - 47 should be completely 
removed from Ms Bs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Ms B a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Ms Bs complaint. Elevate  Credit International Limited 
should put things right for Ms B as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2020.
