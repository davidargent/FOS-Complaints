K821x#15complaint
Ms B complains  that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid, lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner.  
background
Ms B took out 43 loans  with QuickQuid between June 2013  and September 2018. All but 
one of the loans were  payday loans. Loan  11 was a FlexCredit  loan that provided Ms B with 
a revolving credit facility. Ms B repaid all her loans with QuickQuid. A summary of Ms Bs 
borrowing from QuickQuid is attached at an appendix to this decision. 
Ms B says she took out monthly loans and was reliant on them, which made her financial 
position worse. 
In response to Ms Bs complaint, QuickQuid offered to refund interest and fees, plus interest,    
in relation to loans five, six, nine and ten. It said that the repayment of those loans accounted 
for too much of Ms Bs monthly  disposable income and that it should  have carried out 
additional checks before  those loans.  Ms B didnt accept that offer.  
One of our adjudicators assessed  Ms Bs complaint. He said that QuickQuid should not  
have given Ms B loans  four to 43. The adjudicator set out what  QuickQuid should do to put 
things right. 
QuickQuid didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment. It said that as it had already made 
an offer in relation to loans five, six, nine and ten, its response was in relation to loans four, 
seven, eight and 11-43. QuickQuid said, in summary:
It wasnt  possible  to determine sustainability  without analysing  whether the 
repayments for each  loan were made  without  undue  difficulty.  
Its checks  didnt reveal that there was any reason to suggest  Ms B couldnt afford the 
repayments. 
Ms B had an exemplary repayment history.
It carried  out appropriate checks and wasnt required  to carry out additional checks.  
Ms Bs remaining disposable income was sufficient to repay  the loans.
There were gaps  in borrowing which doesnt  demonstrate dependency. 
As the complaint hasnt been resolved informally,  its been passed to me, an ombudsman,  to 
decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN64030002QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice, this means that it should have  carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Ms B 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Ms B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading Irresponsible Lending guidance  and later 
the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Bs complaint.
Ive noted what  QuickQuid has said about  the gaps in Ms Bs lending.  Ive given this careful 
thought. The largest gap QuickQuid has referred to is 54 days between  repaying loan 24 in 
late September 2016 and taking out loan 25 in late November 2016. By then, Ms B had been 
borrowing from QuickQuid with very little break for over three years.  I dont think  that the 
gaps QuickQuid has mentioned or any of the gaps in Ms Bs lending are such that 
QuickQuid was entitled to treat her as a new customer. So, Im dealing  with one period of 
lending here from mid 2013 to late 2018.
QuickQuid has made  an offer in relation to loans five, six, nine and ten. I dont think  that its 
offer goes far enough  and Ill explain why. 
Ref: DRN64030003I dont think that QuickQuid was wrong to give Ms B loans one, two or the initial amount of 
loan three.  Given the loan amounts,  what was apparent about  Ms Bs circumstances  at the 
time and her history  with QuickQuid at that point, I dont think it wouldve been  proportionate 
for QuickQuid to ask Ms B for the amount  of information needed to show the lending was 
unsustainable. There wasnt  anything in the information Ms B provided or the information  
QuickQuid should  have been  aware of, which meant it would have been  proportionate for 
QuickQuid to start verifying what Ms B said about  her finances.  
I think that the position changed from the top-up  of loan three taken on 15 August 2013. 
After that top-up, Ms Bs repayment was £940. And this was the fourth advance Ms B had 
taken from QuickQuid in around two months.  I think that at this point, proportionate checks  
are likely to have established a much  fuller picture  of Ms Bs financial position. I think 
proportionate checks here would have  meant  that QuickQuid took steps to look closely into 
Ms Bs financial position and verify  what she said about it by, for example, asking to see her 
bank statements. 
Ms B has provided some bank statements but not those that would show  me what 
QuickQuid would likely have seen  if it had carried out proportionate steps before the top-up 
of loan three. So, based on what Ive seen, I cant say that QuickQuid shouldnt have given 
Ms B the top-up of loan three. 
I dont think that QuickQuid should  have  given Ms B loan four. Thats because the 
repayment of loan four represented a significant  proportion of Ms Bs income. Loan four was 
repayable in two instalments of £187.50  and £1,187.50. Ms Bs stated  income at that point 
was £2,895. In these  circumstances, there  was a significant risk that Ms B wouldnt be able 
to meet  her existing  commitments without having  to borrow again. And I dont think  its 
appropriate to say that Ms B should  have put money aside after the first instalment in order 
to pay the second instalment. I think its unlikely that Ms B would have been able to repay 
loan four sustainably   and any subsequent  loans.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Ms Bs lending history with QuickQuid  with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Bs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
six. I say this because  by then, Ms Bs overall pattern of borrowing  suggested  that she had 
become persistently reliant on short-term loans.  Ms B had taken  six loans and one top-up 
from QuickQuid over a period of almost six months. Whilst the amounts Ms B borrowed 
fluctuated, they didnt  decrease significantly over this period and for the rest of the borrowing 
relationship with QuickQuid. 
Ms B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed QuickQuid. Loan 43 was 
taken out over four years after Ms Bs first loan with QuickQuid and it was for a substantially  
larger amount. Ms B had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service an intermittent 
debt to QuickQuid  over an extended period.  In my view, the pattern of lending, in itself,  
shows that the loans from loan six were  unsustainable. I dont think  that QuickQuid  should  
have given Ms B loans  six to 43. 
Ref: DRN64030004I think that Ms B lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan six  
onwards because these loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Ms Bs indebtedness by 
allowing her to take expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time. And the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative  implications  on Ms Bs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, in addition to loan four and the offer QuickQuid  has already made in relation to loan five, 
Im also upholding  the complaint about  loans six to 43. QuickQuid should  put things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms B paid on loans four to 43;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans four and five from Ms Bs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans six to 43 should  be removed from 
Ms Bs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Ms B a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off, if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I largely uphold  Ms Bs complaint and I direct  CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
to put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Scheme, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 September 2019.
