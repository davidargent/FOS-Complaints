Break  in lending  start  of new chain of lending
5 21/09/2017 outstanding 6 £600.00 £200.00
Mr H has said Sunny did not lend to him responsibly. Sunny has said it completed eligibility, 
creditworthiness and affordability checks for each loan application. 
Loan 5 was the start of a new chain of lending and our adjudicator found nothing wrong with 
this loan being given to Mr H. But our adjudicator upheld Mr Hs complaint in part and 
thought loans 1 to 4 should not have been given.  Sunny disagreed  so the complaint  has now 
been passed to me to decide.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN47115392the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Mr H hasnt disagreed  with our adjudicators opinion on loan 5 so I wont be looking at this
loan any further  as there is no ongoing  disagreement about  it. But I will bear it in mind when
Im looking  at Mr Hs other lending.
When Mr H asked to borrow loan 1, I can see the monthly repayment that Sunny
required took up a significant proportion (over  25%)  of Mr Hs declared monthly income over 
an extended period of time. In the circumstances and despite the checks  that Sunny carried  
out, there  was a significant risk that Mr H wouldnt have  been able to repay the loan without 
undue difficulty or borrowing further. I dont consider it was reasonable for Sunny to agree to 
lend based on what it knew  about Mr H.
It follows that I uphold  Mr Hs complaint about  loan 1, and as a result  I also uphold  Mr Hs
complaint about  loans  2 to 4 - so Sunny should put things right. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 1 to 4;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 1 to 4 from Mr Hs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN47115393my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 April 2020.
