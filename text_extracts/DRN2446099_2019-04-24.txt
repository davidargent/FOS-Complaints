K821x#15complaint
Mrs F complains about issues shes experienced with a car supplied  with finance  from 
Close Brothers Limited.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy  of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I proposed to uphold the complaint and to require 
Close Brothers to cancel the agreement.  I invited  Mrs F and Close Brothers  to let me have 
any further evidence  or arguments they wanted to make before I finally  determined  the 
matter. Both Mrs F and Close Brothers  said they accepted  my provisional  decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Because both Mrs F and Close  Brothers have accepted  my provisional decision I see no 
reasons to reach different  conclusions to the ones I set out in my provisional decision.
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is to uphold  this complaint.  Close Brothers Limited must:
Cancel Mrs Fs conditional sale agreement with nothing further to pay
Arrange for the car to be collected  at no cost to Mrs F.
Refund 50% of the payments Mrs F has made  under the agreement
Refund any deposit paid by Mrs F together with 8% simple interest per annum from 
the date of payment to the date of settlement 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 May 2019.
