The complaint
Mr O has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-sold him two 
packaged bank accounts, the first called an Advantage Gold account and the second called 
a Select Platinum account. 
NatWest charged Mr O monthly fees for both accounts and provided several potential 
benefits in return. Mr O thinks that NatWest should refund him all the fees he paid, plus 
interest. 
What happened
Mr O has banked with NatWest for a long time. NatWest has sent us information about his 
account history, which shows that:
in 1993, Mr O opened a fee-free account, 
in May 2002, NatWest sold Mr O the Advantage Gold account, which replaced his 
fee-free account and for which it charged a monthly fee, 
in July 2015, NatWest switched Mr O to the Select Platinum Account and continued 
to charge a monthly fee,
in April 2019, Mr O switched back to a fee-free account.
This account history is not in dispute and I have taken it to be accurate. 
One of our adjudicators has already looked into Mr Os complaint. The adjudicator didnt 
think that we could consider the part of Mr Os complaint about the Advantage Gold account 
because he had brought it to us too late; and thought that NatWest had treated Mr O fairly 
when it switched him to the Select Platinum account. 
Mr O didnt agree with the adjudicators findings and asked for an ombudsman to review his 
case. So, it has come to me to make a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about packaged bank accounts on our website, 
and Ive used this approach to help me to decide what to do about this case. Ive looked into 
everything that Mr O and NatWest have told us or sent us about the complaint. I have 
decided that I do not have the authority to consider the way NatWest sold the Advantage 
Gold to Mr O as he brought it to us too late; and that NatWest treated him fairly when it 
switched him to the Select Platinum account. Ive explained why I reached my decision 
below, but as my findings for the two parts of Mr Os complaint are very different, I have 
described them separately.
The Advantage Gold account (2002)
The Financial Conduct Authority has set time limits for the complaints we can consider. 
Amongst other things, these limits say that we can only consider complaints which 
customers bring to us:
within six years of the event they are complaining about (the six-year rule);
 or (if longer), 
upto three years after they knew, or reasonably ought to have known, that they had a 
reason to complain (the three-year rule).
NatWest sold the Advantage Gold account to Mr O in 2002, but he didnt complain to us 
until 2019, which clearly falls outside the six-year rule. 
Mr O has raised quite few points of complaint, including saying that he didnt want or 
need the benefits of the Advantage Gold account. NatWest has shown that it sent Mr O 
information about these benefits in March 2009 and March 2010. So, it seems reasonable 
that Mr O should have known that he had reason to complain about the Advantage Gold 
account as early as 2009. This part of Mr Os complaint therefore also falls outside the 
three-year rule.
I have not seen any exceptional circumstance which may have allowed me to consider 
this part of Mr Os complaint, despite the time limits. And NatWest has not agreed to 
waive the rules for Mr O. So, I havent considered the way NatWest sold the Advantage 
Gold account to Mr O as I dont have authority to do so.
The Select Platinum account (2015) 
During 2015, NatWest decided to withdraw Advantage Gold accounts from its customers. 
It did this for commercial reasons and along with other banks it is allowed to make 
changes like this. However, to treat Mr O fairly, I would have expected it to tell him what 
was happening, give him fair notice and allow him reasonable choices if he wasnt happy 
with NatWests intentions.
NatWest has told us that in 2015 it wrote to all customers about the changes it was 
making and has sent us an example letter from the time. Im satisfied that NatWest sent 
such a letter to Mr O. 
The letter: 
explained that it was moving Mr O to the Select Platinum account because it was similar 
to the Advantage Gold account,
described the main differences in the benefits the two accounts could provide,
told Mr O about the monthly fee for the Select Platinum account.
The letter also explained to Mr O that if he didnt think the Select Platinum account was 
right for him, he could visit one of NatWests branches or ring NatWest to discuss other 
accounts, including some without a monthly fee.
It seems to me that NatWest met its obligation to Mr O when it sent hm this letter and 
treated him fairly in switching him to the Select Platinum account.So, in summary, I havent considered the way NatWest sold the Advantage Gold account to 
Mr O as I dont have authority to do so. And I dont think that NatWest mis-sold the Select 
Platinum account to Mr O.
My final decision
For the reasons I have set out above, I am not upholding any part of Mr Os complaint about 
that National Westminster Bank Plc. I am not going to tell it to give him any money back. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 March 2021.
