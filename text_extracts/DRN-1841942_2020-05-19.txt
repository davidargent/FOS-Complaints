The complaint
Miss W complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as MoneyBoat) didnt do 
enough checks before lending to her. 
What happened
Miss W had two loans from MoneyBoat between June 2016 and August 2016 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly 
RepaymentDue Repaid
1 16 Jun 2016 £300 70d £209.64 25 Aug 2016 On time
2 31 Aug 2016 £550 147d £182.21 25 Jan 2017 10 May 2018
Repayment Plan
 
Miss W says MoneyBoat should not have lent to her as she already had short-term loans 
with multiple companies and was trying to keep afloat with further borrowing. She says if 
proper checks had been carried out MoneyBoat would have found the loans were 
unaffordable. Miss W says she had mounting debts from other unsecured loans as well as 
defaults and County Court Judgments (CCJs) that would have shown on her credit file. She 
adds that she could not make the repayments which resulted in a further CCJ and a 
detrimental effect on her mental health.
MoneyBoat says it checked Miss Ws credit file, and a bank statement, prior to her first loan 
and found no other lending in the previous 12 months. It says it also asked Miss W about her 
income, expenditure and living arrangements and verified this information using external 
sources. Although it increased Miss Ws declared expenditure figure, MoneyBoat says it 
found the loans to be affordable. MoneyBoat adds that it also declined other applications 
from Miss W as they did not meet its criteria.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He said that he was 
satisfied MoneyBoat had carried out proportionate checks and there was nothing in the 
available information that would have indicated the lending was unsustainable.
Miss W responded to say, in summary, that she contacted MoneyBoat on various occasions 
to explain she was in financial hardship and was on a payment plan for a year. She says it 
was unfair that she had to pay an extra £700, in addition to the repayment plan instalments, 
as a result of the CCJ.
My provisional findingsI issued a provisional decision to Miss W and to MoneyBoat on 11 May 2020. I summarise 
my findings here:
I was satisfied MoneyBoat did enough checks before it approved loan 1 and that 
there was nothing in the available information that should have led MoneyBoat to 
decline this application;
I considered that, in all the circumstances of Miss Ws second loan application, 
MoneyBoat should have carried out additional checks. I said that because: 
oMiss W applied for loan 2 a few days after repaying loan 1;
oIt was for almost twice the amount of the previous loan and was to be repaid 
over a longer period;
oMiss Ws credit file was now showing an additional default from June 2016.
I considered proportionate checks should have included asking Miss W specific 
questions about other short-term loans;
I found that if MoneyBoat had carried out such checks, it was likely to have found 
Miss W had taken out a large short-term loan just days earlier with scheduled 
monthly repayments of over £250;
Given MoneyBoat had calculated Miss Ws disposable income to be £464, I didnt 
consider this was sufficient disposable income for her to sustainably make the loan 
repayments over the five-month term.
 
So my provisional decision was that MoneyBoat was irresponsible to have approved 
Miss Ws second loan and that it should refund interest and charges (plus 8% statutory 
interest). I also said MoneyBoat should take steps to ensure the associated CCJ is set aside 
at no cost to Miss W if possible and also ensure that it is not reported on her credit file.
Miss W accepted my provisional decision.
MoneyBoat responded to say, in summary, that it considered its checks were proportionate 
given the infancy of the lending decision. It says there was insufficient evidence that further 
checks should have been undertaken as Miss W had already been asked about her income 
and expenditure (including loan payments).
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
I accept what MoneyBoat says about proportionate checks at the beginning of a lending 
relationship, but given the particular circumstances of this case, I still dont find its checks for 
loan 2 went far enough. MoneyBoats own credit check showed the number of defaults in the 
last three years had increased from eight (including one in the last 12 months) to 
nine (including two in the last 12 months) between the two loan applications.
At the time of loan 1, the latest default showing was in October 2015, so I considered it was 
reasonable for MoneyBoat to have approved loan 1 almost 8 months later. However, when a 
further default appeared between loan 1 and loan 2, I think MoneyBoat should have realised 
Miss Ws financial problems may not have resolved and it should have carried out further 
checks.
Proportionate checks would have shown:The additional default was on 2 June 2016;
Miss W had taken an additional short-term loan on 25 August 2016 with another 
provider.
 
I acknowledge MoneyBoat says Miss Ws expenditure should also have included loan 
repayments, but shed only declared £60 for expenditure other than rent, food and travel. 
Indeed, MoneyBoat increased her expenditure figure by £280 based upon what it saw in her 
credit file. But Miss Ws credit file did not show her most recent short-term loan and I 
consider a proportionate check should have included specific questions about these. This 
was likely to have shown a further under-reporting of Miss Ws expenditure meaning she 
was unlikely to be able to sustainably repay loan 2.
Based on the above explanation, I see no reason to depart from my provisional decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss Ws complaint. Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading 
as MoneyBoat) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Miss W paid on loan 2;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative information about loan 2 from Miss Ws credit file and in 
particular ensure that the CCJ is not reported;
Take steps to set aside the CCJ if possible at no cost to Miss W.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Miss W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 June 2020.
