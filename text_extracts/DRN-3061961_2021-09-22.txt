The complaint
Mr L complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua lent irresponsibly by approving two credit
cards in his name and increasing the credit limits.  
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. In my provisional decision I said: 
In February 2016 Mr L applied for an Aqua credit card with NewDay. Mr L said he was 
employed earning around £45,000 and had £200 of unsecured credit. NewDay found Mr 
L had £1,400 of defaults across four accounts, the most recent of which was around 13 
months old. NewDay approved a credit limit of £250.
In August 2016 NewDay increased the credit limit to £800. In March 2017 NewDay 
increased the Aqua credit limit to £1,300. In the same month, Mr L applied for a Marbles 
credit card with NewDay.
In the Marbles application, Mr L said his income was £50,000 and NewDay found he 
had unsecured credit totalling around £44,000. Mr Ls most recent default at this point 
was 26 months old. NewDay approved the Marbles credit card with a credit limit of 
£600.
In October 2017 Mr L made his last payment to the Aqua credit card and in November 
2017 he made the last payment to the Marbles credit card. Mr L has explained he was 
trapped in a cycle of debt and that he was unable to sustainably maintain repayments. 
The accounts were terminated and defaulted.
Mr L complained that NewDay had lent irresponsibly but it didnt agree and said the credit 
cards had been approved in line with its lending criteria. Mr L referred his complaint to this 
service and it was passed to an investigator. They thought NewDay had lent irresponsibly 
when it increased Mr Ls Aqua credit card limit to £1,300 and when it approved the 
Marbles credit card. The investigator said NewDay should:
-Refund interest and charges to the Aqua credit card in relation to balances over 
£800
-Refund all interest and charges to the Marbles credit card from inception
-Remove adverse credit reported in relation to the Marbles credit card
-Pay Mr L a total of £150 for the trouble and upset cause. 
NewDay didnt accept the investigators view and said the decision to approve Mr Ls 
credit cards and credit limit increases was in line with its lending criteria. As NewDay 
didnt accept, Mr Ls complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive taken the step of issuing a provisional decision as whilst I agree with the 
investigators view that Mr Ls complaint should be upheld, Ive reached a different 
decision concerning how to resolve matters. Ive also reached a different view to the 
investigator concerning the point at which I think NewDay shouldve completed additional 
checks.
Before a business agrees to lend, it should take reasonable steps to ensure it does so in a 
responsible way. Theres no set list of checks a lender has to complete. In practice, this 
means businesses should ensure proportionate checks are carried out to make sure the 
customer can afford to repay the borrowing in a sustainable way. These checks should 
take into account various factors, like the amount being lent, the costs to the borrower 
each month, credit history and the consumers income and outgoings. As the relationship 
between lender and borrower progresses, the business may need to consider carrying out 
more comprehensive checks to ensure the borrower can afford repayments in a 
sustainable way.
I agree with the investigator that NewDay failed to carry out proportionate checks and 
that, as a result, it lent irresponsibly. I think there were signs in the information available 
to NewDay that Mr L was increasingly reliant on credit and unable to sustainably 
manage his repayments.
Ive looked at the initial decision to approve Mr Ls Aqua credit card. At this stage, Mr L 
appeared to have around £200 of unsecured credit and his income was given as £45,000. 
NewDay says the defaults it found were in line with its lending criteria. The initial credit 
limit was modest at £250 and I agree NewDay carried out proportionate checks before 
approving Mr Ls Aqua credit card.
NewDay increased the Aqua credit limit to £800 in August 2016. I think there were already 
signs Mr L was struggling that shouldve caused Aqua to consider completing further 
checks before offering more credit. I can see Mr L exceeded his credit limit and was 
charged two fees as a result in May 2016. Mr L also incurred late fees in the months 
immediately before the credit limit increase. I also note that Mr L said he had £200 of 
unsecured credit when he applied, but in July 2017, the month before the increase, his 
outstanding balance had increased to £768. When taken together with the money Mr L 
now owed NewDay, there was a substantial increase in his unsecured borrowing. The 
new credit limit was over three times the original. In my view, NewDay shouldve carried 
out more proportionate checks before deciding to offer Mr L a credit limit increase.
Mr L has told us he was borrowing from payday lenders and taking high interest loans 
around this time. Mr L has explained his debt levels were increasing and that he was 
experiencing financial difficulties. Had NewDay carried our proportionate checks and 
looked at Mr Ls circumstances in greater detail I think it wouldve found Mr L wasnt able 
to support increased borrowing and declined to proceed.
It follows that if I think the first credit limit increase was unaffordable, subsequent 
increases were the same. Ive looked at whether there was anything else that shouldve 
caused NewDay to carry out more comprehensive checks before it increased the credit 
limit to £1,300 in March 2017. Whilst Mr L didnt exceed his credit limit or pay late, the 
level of unsecured credit NewDay found increased by over £40,000. Given Mr L now 
owed a figure that was broadly in line with his income, I think NewDay shouldve 
considered carrying out better checks before it increased the credit limit to £1,300. Had it done so, I think it wouldve seen Mr Ls use of credit was increasing and that he would 
be unlikely to be in a position to affordably repay his Aqua credit card balance.
In the same month NewDay increased Mr Ls credit limit on his Aqua credit card by £500 it 
approved a Marbles account with e £600 credit limit. I can see Mr L gave an increased 
income figure in his application, but given the history of his existing relationship with 
NewDay I think it should have looked into his circumstances in greater detail before 
deciding to proceed. For the same reasons Ive give above, had it done so, I think NewDay 
wouldve declined Mr Ls Marbles application.
Based on the information Ive seen so far, I intend to uphold Mr Ls complaint. In my view, 
NewDay lent irresponsibly when it increased the Aqua credit limit to £800 in August 2016 
and £1,300 in March 2017. I also think NewDay lent irresponsibly when it approved Mr Ls 
Marbles credit card. As I think NewDay lent irresponsibly, I dont think its fair for it to 
report adverse information about Mr L to the credit reference agencies. Unlike the 
investigator, in my view this approach should reflect both the Aqua and Marbles credit 
card. I intend to tell NewDay to settle as follows:
-Refund all interest and charges applied to balances over £250 on the Aqua 
credit card from August 2016 onwards
-Refund all interest and charges applied to the Marbles credit card since inception
-If at any period the interest refunds result in Mr Ls closed accounts being in 
credit, pay 8% simple annual interest on the date that credit balance arose to 
the date of settlement
-Remove all adverse information reported to the credit reference agencies 
concerning Mr Ls Aqua credit card from August 2016 onwards
-Remove all information reported to the credit reference agencies concerning Mr 
Ls Marbles credit card from inception
-If NewDay has sold either of the accounts it will need to liaise with the new debt 
owner to put the settlement in place. NewDay may need to consider buying back the 
accounts
I asked both parties to respond with any additional comments or information they wanted me 
to consider before I made my final decision. NewDay didnt have anything further to add and 
Mr L responded to say he would accept. But Mr L advised NewDay sold his Marbles debt to 
a third party which has subsequently obtained a County Court Judgement (CCJ). 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As NewDay hasnt responded with new information for me to consider and Mr L says he 
accepts, Im going to proceed in line with the conclusions I reached in my provisional 
decision. I still think Mr Ls complaint should be upheld, for the same reasons. 
Mr L has told us the new owner of the Marbles credit card debt has obtained a CCJ and 
asked how this settlement will impact that. This complaint, and the settlement Ive set out, 
only relates to NewDay. I understand things have changed and Mr L has found a CCJ in 
relation to the Marbles debt. But in this decision I can only talk about NewDays actions and 
make directions concerning how it should settle. 
If Mr L remains unhappy with the CCJ, in light of this decision, he has the option of following 
the matter directly with the current Marbles debt owner.  Putting things right
I still think Mr Ls complaint should be upheld, for the same reasons. NewDay should settle 
as follows: 
- Refund all interest and charges applied to balances over £250 on the Aqua 
credit card from August 2016 onwards
- Refund all interest and charges applied to the Marbles credit card since inception
- If at any period the interest refunds result in Mr Ls closed accounts being in 
credit, pay 8% simple annual interest on the date that credit balance arose to 
the date of settlement
- Remove all adverse information NewDay has reported to the credit reference 
agencies concerning Mr Ls Aqua credit card from August 2016 onwards
- Remove all information NewDay has reported to the credit reference agencies 
concerning Mr Ls Marbles credit card from inception
- If NewDay has sold either of the accounts it will need to liaise with the new debt 
owner to put the settlement in place. NewDay may need to consider buying back the 
accounts
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to settle in line with the 
above guidance.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 October 2021.
