Our adjudicator partly upheld Mr Rs complaint  and thought loans 3 to 6 shouldnt have been 
given the amount Mr R had to repay  and the pattern of his borrowing. Mr Lender  disagreed  
and the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN80752272the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint. Having done  this, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
There was a significant break in Mr Rs borrowing  from Mr Lender. There  was a gap of 
nearly two years between  loans 6 and 7. I think it would be reasonable for Mr Lender to view 
this gap as an indication that Mr Rs finances had stabilised from whatever had caused him 
to take out the previous  loans. So, I will look at Mr Rs borrowing in two separate lending 
chains. 
Chain one was made up of loans 1 to 6, and chain two was made up of loans 7 to 10. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Mr Lender needed to do more when it approved loans  1 and 2 in 
chain one. And all the loans  in chain two. Mr R hasnt provided  any further evidence or 
arguments for me to consider. As such, I wont be making any further findings on these loans 
as they no longer appear to be in dispute.  So, that just leaves loans 3 to 6 to consider. 
Mr Lender says it carried out robust checks on Mr R when he applied  for loan 3. This 
included asking him about his income and outgoings.  It also says it carried  out credit checks  
which didnt reveal  anything of concern. But I think if Mr Lender had properly considered     
Mr Rs financial  situation and the lending, I think it would have seen that Mr R wasnt able to 
take on this borrowing.  
I say this because  Mr R was borrowing £750,  which was due to be repaid in one payment  
plus interest. This meant  that Mr R would be repaying around £975  from his monthly 
income of £2,400. In my view, this repayment represented a significant proportion  of Mr Rs 
income and I think Mr Lender ought to have realised this and the potential  for Mr R to 
struggle to make the repayment. Given Mr Rs income and borrowing, it seems there was a 
Ref: DRN80752273significant chance of Mr R having to borrow again to meet his commitment  under this loan. 
This was shown to be true when Mr R took out further borrowing two days after repaying 
loan 3 and for a larger amount. 
Mr Lender was under a duty to ensure the lending could be sustainably  repaid and in       
Mr Rs cases I dont think it was. And I think this would have been  clear to Mr Lender at the 
outset when it gathered  the information  from Mr R. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders  lending history with Mr R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Mr Lender  should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Mr Lender should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 4. I say 
this because:
At this point Mr Lender  ought  to have realised  Mr R was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr R had been indebted to Mr Lender for 11 months.  So,            
Mr Lender ought  to have  realised it was more likely than not Mr R was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Rs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Rs first loan was for £450 and loan 4 was for £850.  At this point Mr Lender ought  
to have known  that Mr R was not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From  loan 4 onwards  Mr R was provided  with a new loan quickly  of settling the 
previous one. 
Mr R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Mr Lender. Loan  6 was 
taken out 13 months after Mr Rs first. And it was for a much  larger  amount. Mr R had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Mr Lender over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr R lost out because Mr Lender continued to provide borrowing  from loan 4 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period.
the length of time over which Mr R borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mr Rs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Mr Lender  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on 3 to 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 3 from Mr Rs credit file;
Ref: DRN80752274the information recorded  about  loans 4, 5 and 6 is adverse. So, all entries about 
these loans should be removed from Mr Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest.  Mr Lender must  give 
Mr R a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. PDL Finance  Limited  
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 March  2020.
