The complaint
Mrs M complains as executor of her late husband, Mr Ms, estate that he should have been 
advised by his then financial advisers, Medical & Executive Financial Services (MEFS) to 
apply for Fixed Protection 2012 (FP2012). Mrs M says her husband lost out financially as a 
result.
What happened
The late Mr M had been a client of MEFS since the 1980s. Mr M consulted his advisers in 
October 2011. MEFS calculated the value of his pensions at that time. It was noted that Mr 
Ms final salary pension in payment represented 53.42% of a £1.5 million LTA. The notes 
said that left 46.58% (£698,700) of the Lifetime Allowance (LTA) outstanding. The notes 
further recorded that Mr M had two other uncrystallised pensions totaling £580,228. 
According to a portfolio report, Mr M also had another pension (not mentioned in the 
handwritten notes) of £51,836.58. So, together his other pensions totaled £632,064.58.
In February 2014, MEFS emailed Mr M, the email said in part Prior to the changes to 
pension rules in April 2006 your combined funds amounted to £502,105 and to calculate 
your total fund value including your  funds you then add a multiple of 25 times your then 
gross annual  income which was confirmed at £29,236 i e £730,900 + £502,105 brings 
your total Fund value at that time to £1,233,005 well within the lifetime limit of £1.5m.
As you know the overall limit then gradually increased each year from April 2007 to the 
end of April 2012 to £1 8m and then for the 2012/13 tax year it reduced to £1 5m
I have a file note which confirms your  gross annual pension to be £33,933 in the 
2011/12 tax year increasing the  fund value to £848,325. At that time your combined 
Aegon and Phoenix funds amounted to £596,277 up £94,173 from the 2006 value which 
then brought your total fund value to £1,444,303, again within the £1.5m limit.
From April this year the limit is reducing to £1.25 million and it is therefore important that 
you apply for the 2014 Fixed Protection especially with your combined Aegon and Phoenix 
plans currently valued at £727,386.67 up some £225,281 since A day 2006 and will no 
doubt [although there is no guarantee] continue to increase in value if you apply for 
protection you will only be able to cap at £1.5m and unfortunately any continued growth on 
the funds over and above will be subject to tax on crystallisation. In addition as your  
pension increases so does its value. If you take no action then the £1.25m would then 
apply
Mr M changed advisers in April 2014. In an email to MEFS he wrote Thank you for your 
email. You are quite right, I have decided to change financial advisors to a more advisory 
and active one. I was disappointed to have to find out for myself about the LTA rules and 
limit. It is debatable how much I have lost by not applying for the £1.8M limit, but it would 
certainly be tens of thousands of pounds in tax with the £1.5m one if I had not been advised 
to apply in time. It has been mentioned that there may be, arguably, a case to answer. The 
Sterling ISAs have performed badly and have high charges. I was also not Informed that I 
would no longer be able to have a draw-down capability with my Phoenix pension because 
they no longer offer this.
Mr M applied for FP 2014 with the advice of his new financial advisers, fixing his LTA at £1.5 
million.
Mr M turned age 75 in 2019 and his pensions were subject to a final benefit crystallisation 
calculation against his LTA of £1.5 million This resulted in a tax charge of 25% (£58,709). 
Mr M wrote to MEFS on 3 July 2019 complaining that he should have been advised to 
apply for FP2012 and that his tax charge would have been significantly lower.
MEFS did not uphold the complaint and said that the complaint had been brought too late.
Mr M referred his complaint to this service in November 2020. MEFS said the complaint had 
been brought out of time. One of our ombudsman decided that Mr Ms complaint could be 
considered by our service.
Mr M passed away in February 2021 and Mrs M, as executor of her late husbands 
estate, now brings this complaint on Mr Ms estates behalf.
Our investigator considered the merits of this complaint and recommended that it should 
be upheld. She found that MEFS ought to have provided advice about FP2012 and that if 
it had Mr W wouldve applied for fixed protection at £1.8 million. She therefore took the 
view that the late Mr M had lost out financially as a result.
MEFS didnt agree with our investigators view. It said, in summary:
It sent regular updates to clients, including Mr. M. He didnt raise any concerns when
he met with his adviser in October 2011.
It carried out calculations as and when required and in October 2011 as required
for FP 2012 it established that Mr M had a remaining lifetime allowance percentage 
of 53.73%. So, Mr M had more than enough LTA remaining as at April 2012, when 
calculated at October 2011, this equated to around £806,000.
Mr M was a low risk investor, so it seemed unlikely that he would have exceeded
the reducing lifetime allowance set at £1.5 million.
Mr Ms pensions were revalued in 2014 for FP2014 purposes. As the value of his
pensions were close to the £1.5 million allowance he was advised to apply for 
FP2014.He was told that any continued growth above £1.5 million would be subject 
to tax on crystallisation. This email also set out actions he should take, such as 
taking his remaining tax-free cash entitlement.
Mr M emailed in April 2014 expressing concern about the value of his pensions 
compared to the LTA. It doesnt seem that he took action at that time.
He didnt pursue a complaint against MEFS in 2014 as he had no grounds to do so,
nor had he suffered any financial loss.
Aware of the LTA, Mr M went on to increase his equity exposure during rising
markets from a low risk portfolio to a balanced investment, exacerbating the LTA 
due to the investment returns.
The LTA tax position should not have been a shock to Mr M as he was aware of the
issue from 2014.
MEFS is not responsible for Mr M or his advisers actions after 2014. The ultimate
value of his pensions at age 75 was not MEFS fault having issued warnings about 
this.Mr M ought to have received regular valuations from his new advisers and better
management after 2014 may have prevented the tax charge.
He could have taken the remaining tax-free cash prior to him reaching age 75.
The only benefit crystallisation event test that should have been applicable when he 
reached age 75 should have been the test on drawdown funds, which is the market 
value of drawdown fund(s) at 75 less the amount originally moved in to pension 
drawdown at the outset, i.e. only the growth is tested.
The test on uncrystallised money purchase funds would not have been applicable at
age 75 had he taken is tax free lump sum entitlement earlier.
As agreement hasnt been reached the late Mr Ms complaint comes to me to issue a final 
decision on.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Fixed Protection 2012
In 2006 the Government introduced the LTA. This set the maximum value of pension 
benefits someone could receive without a tax penalty. Initially it was set at £1.5million. 
This increased each year until 2010-11, when it reached £1.8 million. The Government 
announced in October 2010 the LTA was to reduce to £1.5 million from 2012-13. The 
LTA has been subject to further changes since this time, including a further reduction to 
£1.25 million in the 2014/15 tax year.
Transitional measures were introduced to ease the impact on those who had, or were 
expected to have, benefits which exceeded the new limits. 
Prior to the tax year 2012-13, FP 2012 could be applied for. Once in place, the LTA of 
£1.8million continued to apply. A condition of this protection was that no further 
contributions could to added to a pension from 5 April 2012 onwards. A persons fund didnt 
have to be of above a specific size or benefit value, to apply for FP 2012, as long as they 
didnt have enhanced protection or primary protection. It was aimed at those whose 
pension benefits would, or were likely to, exceed the LTA (£1.5million) when benefits were 
taken. It couldnt be applied for retrospectively, if FP2012 wasnt applied for by 5 April 2012, 
the £1.8million LTA was lost.
MEFS advice regarding FP2012
MEFS had been acting as Mr Ms advisers since the 1980s so, I agree with our 
investigator Mr M had a clear, established and ongoing relationship with MEFS. It seems 
he consulted with MEFS in October 2011, when it calculated the value of his pensions at 
that time. 
I note that Mr M had taken his final salary pension back in 2006 and was making no 
ongoing contributions into his other pensions at the time of his October 2011 consultation.
Given that MEFS was acting as Mr Ms adviser, I think reasonably Mr M couldve 
expected it to discuss with him the implications of any changes in pensions legislation 
that may impact on his pensions going forwards. I note that MEFS had highlighted 
changes regarding the LTA in 2005 and again in 2014. So, its not clear why it seems 
not have provided clear advice on FP2012.Ive seen the handwritten notes of the October 2011 consultation. I havent been provided 
with anything else from MEFS to show that it discussed with him the reduction of the LTA 
from £1.8 million to £1.5 million in the 2012/13 tax year or asked him whether he wanted to 
apply for FP2012.
As at 5 April 201,2 the values of Mr Ms pensions exceeded the new £1.5 million LTA, they 
were:
final salary pension in payment pre 2006, which was £34,881 per annum. This 
would have to be multiplied by 25, so the value for LTA purposes was £872,025.
 Mr Ms Aegon plans were £387,501.72 and £69,157.51. The total of both plans 
was £456,659.23.
Mr Ms Phoenix Life plan value was £256,324.67 
The total value of Mr Ms pensions as at 5 April 2012 was £1,585,008.90
Mr M said that there would have been no downside to him of applying for FP 2012. I cant 
see that there would have been, because he was not making any ongoing contributions 
into his pensions. Ive not been told that he had enhanced or primary protection either. 
Had Mr M been advised to apply for FP2012, I think he would have done so, given there 
appeared to be no apparent downside and the value of his pensions was already in 
excess of the £1.5 million LTA at the beginning of the 2012/13 tax year. Further he still had 
around eight years to go until he was 75, when the pensions would be crystallised for LTA 
purposes, if not before. 
So, I think the late Mr M lost out financially as a result of what MEFS did wrong, because if 
he had been properly advised about the LTA change prior to 6 April 2012, I think he would 
have successfully applied for FP2012 and fixed his LTA at £1.8 million.
Should Mr M have mitigated his own loss knowing he didnt have FP2012 
MEFS position is that as Mr M was aware of the LTA issue in 2014, he should have taken 
steps after that to mitigate his tax liability going forward.
Not having applied for FP2012, Mr M lost the opportunity to retain his LTA at £1.8 million  
this couldnt be put right. Mr M did, however, apply for FP2014, So, he did take steps to fix 
his protection at £1.5 million, at a time when the LTA was reducing further to £1.25 million. 
MEFS believes that as Mr M was a low risk investor when it was his adviser, it wasnt 
appropriate that he later increased his risk exposure (and therefore his potential for 
investment return). Also, that he should have taken tax free cash prior to age 75, to reduce 
his tax liability at 75.
However, where something has gone wrong, this service looks to put a consumer back in 
the same position they would have been but for the error or omission. Had MEFS provided 
Mr M with advice on FP 2012, as Ive said, I think Mr M wouldve applied for FP2012 and 
retained a LTA of £1.8 million. I cannot fairly conclude therefore, that it was reasonable to 
expect Mr M to restrict his pension decisions, in the way that MEFS suggests he should 
have, because of MEFS wrongdoing. He had around eight years or so, to go until he was 
75, and during this time he ought fairly to have been able to access higher investment 
returns and decide when he wanted to take tax free cash. Notably his pensions were already 
above the £1.5 million LTA at April 2012.Mr M ended up having to pay a LTA charge of £58,709 due to his LTA being fixed at £1.5 
million instead of £1.8 million. So, I think that Mr M has lost out financially because of what 
MEFS has done wrong and that his estate should be compensated as a result.
Putting things right
The LTA charge reduced the value of Mr Ms pension funds. As Mr M has now passed, the 
pension funds would now be paid to his beneficiaries and would be taxed at the 
beneficiaries marginal rate. So, any redress must take into account the impact of income 
tax. Mr M and his estate will have lost out on investment growth on the amounts withdrawn 
to meet the LTA charge.
To put things right, MEFS should:
1) Calculate (A) where (A) is the difference between the actual LTA charge paid, 
and the LTA charge that would have been paid if Mr M had fixed protection at £1.8 
million.
2) Calculate the lost investment growth on (A). This should be calculated by 
reference to the FTSE UK Private Investors Income Total Return Index from the 
dates the charge was paid up to the date Mr M passed away. This loss is (B).
3) (A) plus (B) is the notional gross loss to the pension.
4) Establish the net loss after tax (C), this should be calculated by deducting the 
marginal rate of tax before payment proportionate to the beneficiaries and pay 
this to Mrs M as executor of the late Mr Ms estate to pass on to the 
beneficiaries in accordance with the late Mr Ms will.
5) Pay simple interest on C from the date that Mr M passed away until the date 
of settlement. This should also be paid to Mrs M as executor of the late Mr Ms 
estate to be divided amongst the beneficiaries in accordance with the late Mr 
Ms will..
I have used the FTSE UK Private Investors Income Total Return Index as I consider this 
index will provide a fair reflection of the growth Mr M may have expected.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, I uphold this complaint against Medical & Executive 
Financial Services and order it put things right as set out above..
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Mr M 
to accept or reject my decision before 8 September 2021.
