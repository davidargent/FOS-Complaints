The complaint
Miss H complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest), despite assurances to 
the contrary, removed a dispute marker on her credit card account (credit card) without 
giving her specific and advance notice of the same.
What happened
Miss H entered into a contract with a company that I will call O for the supply of some 
double glazing.
On 4 September 2018 NatWest debited Miss Hs credit card with £4,043.19 in favour of O. 
This took Miss Hs credit card balance to £4,194.61.
On 22 September 2018 Miss H paid her credit card balance of £4,194.61.
On 2 November 2018 NatWest debited Miss Hs credit card with £4,043.20 in favour of O. 
This took Miss Hs credit card balance to £6,158.90.
On 22 November 2018 Miss H paid her credit card balance of £6,158.90.
Miss H wasnt happy with the quality of the double glazing she was supplied with by O 
(including the colour) so she made a claim against NatWest under Section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 (section 75).
On 12 April 2019 NatWest marked the sum of £8,086.39 (£4,043.19 plus £4,043.20) in 
dispute and Miss Hs credit card statement for May 2019 (at its foot) stated payment of 
amount in dispute £8,086.39 not required. This meant that although Miss Hs May statement 
for May 2019 showed an outstanding balance of £1,365.54 no payment from her was 
required.
On 2 September 2019 NatWests section 75 department sent Miss H an email in which it 
said:
I can confirm that NatWest will not suddenly take money from your account, if your 
[section 75] complaint is not upheld. 
The balance on your card is not building up, as the amount of £8,086.39 is currently being 
held in our dispute system, meaning it is not accruing any interest and is not required to be 
paid at this stage.
Miss H wasnt happy with how NatWest was handling her section 75 claim (including asking 
her for an independent report into the quality of her double glazing), so she complained to it.
On 26 February 2020 NatWest issued Miss H with a final response letter (FRL1). Under 
cover of this FRL NatWest said it didnt believe it had done anything wrong (at the time of 
writing) in not upholding her section 75 claim because to date she hadnt provided sufficient 
evidence of a breach of contract or misrepresentation by O, for example by way of an 
independent report.
In March 2020 Miss H received her March 2020 credit card statement which had an 
outstanding balance of £9,083.30 noted. This statement also said that Miss Hs nominated 
bank account would be debited with the full balance on 1 April 2020 or soon after.
On receipt of this statement Miss H queried with NatWest exactly how much would be 
collected by way of direct debit from her nominated bank account on 1 April 2020 or soon 
after. NatWest advised Miss H it would be £996.91 because the sum of £8,086.39 was still 
marked (in its records) as being in dispute. 
Miss H wasnt happy with how her query above had been handled by NatWest, so she 
complained to it.
On 12 March 2020 NatWest issued Miss H with a final response letter (FRL2). Under cover 
of this FRL NatWest said it accepted that its service had been poor and for this it was 
prepared to pay £30, which it did.
On 1 April 2020 Miss H paid her March 2020 credit card balance of £996.91 less the £30 
credited to her credit card on 12 March 2020 by NatWest - £966.91.
In April 2020 Miss H received her April 2020 credit card statement which had an outstanding 
balance of £8,449.17 noted. This statement also said that Miss Hs nominated bank account 
would be debited with the full balance on 2 May 2020 or soon after.
On 17 April 2020 Miss H telephoned NatWest to question how much would be collected by 
way of direct debit from her nominated bank account on 2 May 2020 or soon after. NatWest 
advised Miss H the direct debit wouldnt include the sum of £8,086.39 because as noted at 
the foot of the statement this sum was marked as being in dispute. NatWest also advised 
Miss H that it wouldnt close down her section 75 claim whilst the country was in lockdown.
On 21 April 2020 NatWest issued Miss H with a final response letter (FRL3). Under cover 
of this FRL NatWest said it didnt believe it had done anything wrong when advising Miss H 
how much her March 2020 credit card direct debit payment would be for. And having paid 
her £30 in compensation already for poor service, it had nothing to add to its FRL dated 
12 March 2020 (FRL2).
Between May 2020 and December 2020 Miss H continued to receive statements along 
similar lines to her March and April 2020 statements.
In January 2021 Miss H received her January 2021 credit card statement which had an 
outstanding balance of £8,477.29. This statement said that Miss Hs nominated bank 
account would be debited with the full balance on 1 February 2021 or soon after. The foot of 
this statement didnt display the message payment of amount in dispute £8,086.39 not 
required because NatWest had moved the dispute marker in respect of this sum on 
4 January 2021.
On 1 February 2021 Miss H paid her credit card balance of £8,477.29.On 18 February 2021 Miss H complained to NatWest that despite assurances to the 
contrary, it had removed the dispute marker on her credit card without giving specific and 
advance notice of the same.
On 7 April 2021 NatWest issued Miss H with a final response letter (FRL4). Under cover of 
this FRL NatWest said it didnt believe it had done anything wrong in marking the sum of 
£8,086.39 as no longer being in dispute on 4 January 2021. However, it reiterated its 
previous communications that on receipt of further information supporting a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by O  such as an independent report  it would review her 
section 75 claim again.
On 18 September 2021 Miss H complained to our service. 
Miss Hs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that it 
shouldnt be upheld. 
Miss H didnt agree with the investigators view and so her complaint has been passed to me 
for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I can confirm that Ive come to the same overall outcome as the investigator 
and for broadly the same reasons.
For the avoidance of any doubt I would like to make it clear that Im only considering in this 
decision Miss Hs complaint that NatWest removed the dispute marker (in respect of 
£8,086.39) on her credit card without giving her specific and advance notice, nothing else 
including the matters addressed by NatWest under cover of FRL1, FRL2 and FRL3.
I would also like to reiterate what NatWest has said. And that is although it has closed (at the 
present time) Miss Hs section 75 claim and it will reconsider such claim in the future on 
Miss H providing further evidence of a breach of contract or misrepresentation by O (such as 
an independent inspection report).
I note that Miss H would like us to take wider action against NatWest and the banking 
industry more generally. But I would like to make it clear that Ive no power to fine or punish 
businesses or to direct a particular business to change its processes  that is the role of the 
regulator. 
In support of her complaint Miss H is relying on, in the main, the content of NatWests email 
dated 2 September 2019, and what NatWest confirmed to her over the phone on 
17 April 2020. 
Miss Hs January 2021 statement was no longer printed with the foot note: payment of 
amount in dispute £8,086.39 not required. So, I think it could be said that Miss H was given 
advance notice of NatWests intention to collect £8,477.29, rather than £390.90 (£8,477.29 
less £8,086.39), from her current account on (or shortly after ) 1 February 2021. I also think 
its worth saying that by this point in time Miss H, given her past communications with 
NatWest, would have understood the layout of her statements and where any sums in 
dispute are marked/noted on those statements.Secondly, although the country might have been in lockdown on 17 April 2020 it wasnt for 
the entire period between 17 April 2020 and 4 January 2021. So, I think it could be said that 
NatWest didnt remove the dispute marker in respect of the sum of £8,086.39 until the 
country came out of lockdown, albeit not the last (or final) lockdown.
But even if I wasnt of the above view, I cant see that Miss H has suffered a loss or material 
distress and inconvenience by NatWest not giving her the specific and advance notice she 
believes it should have done before it decided to remove the £8,086.39 from being in 
dispute.
I say this because Miss H has confirmed to our service that she had the money to cover the 
1 February 2021 payment of £8,477.29 and she didnt trust NatWest to give her specific 
and advance notice of its intention to remove the £8,086.39 from being in dispute in any 
event. 
Secondly, in cases such as this, we have regards to what a consumer would have done 
differently had the business done what the consumer says it should have done. But in this 
particular case Miss H has said that she wouldnt have done anything differently. So, Im not 
persuaded Miss H has been prejudiced by anything NatWest did or didnt do in respect of 
the £8,477.29 being marked, and then not marked, as being in dispute.
So, in summary, I find that in the particular circumstances of this case NatWest need do 
nothing further.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 June 2022.
