The complaint
Mr E complains about how Moneybarn No. 1 Limited (Moneybarn) has managed and
administered his conditional sale agreement (agreement), both before and after it was
terminated on 18 July 2017.
To resolve his complaint Mr E wants Moneybarn to refund all payments made by him against
the agreement together with interest, an apology from it and for it to report itself to the
Information Commissioners Office (ICO) for a breach of General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR).
What happened
In April 2015 Mr E entered into a conditional sale agreement with Moneybarn for a used car
costing £8,295.99. Everything else being equal Mr E agreed to make 47 monthly payments
(by direct debit) of £298.36, with the 1st payment due on 16 May 2015 (payable on
1 June 2015) and ending with the 47th payment due on 16 March 2019 (payable on
1 April 2019)  making a total repayable of £14,022.92 (47 x £298.36).
Mr E made the payments required of him by direct debit (of £298.36) for 1 June 2015
through to 1 October 2015.
Mr Es payments by direct debit for 1 November 2015 and 1 December 2015 (of £298.36)
were returned unpaid. However, Mr E made two manual payments of £300 for these failed
payments instead. For the failed two direct debit payments Mr E was charged £36 (2 x £18).
This meant that on 7 December 2015 Mr E was in advance of £3.28 (exclusive of charges)
and £32.72 in arrears (inclusive of charges).
Mr E made the payments required of him by direct debit (of £298.36) for 1 January 2016
through to 1 March 2016.
Mr Es payments by direct debit for 1 April 2016 and 1 May 2016 (of £298.36) were returned
unpaid. For the failed two direct debit payments Mr E was charged £36 (2 x £18). This meant
that on 4 May 2016 Mr E was in arrears of £593.44 (exclusive of charges) and £665.44 in
arrears (inclusive of charges).
Mr E made the payments required of him by direct debit (of £398.36) for 1 June 2016
through to 1 November 2016. This meant that on 1 November 2016 Mr E was in advance of
£6.56 (exclusive of charges) and £65.44 in arrears (inclusive of charges).
Mr E made the payment required of him by direct debit (of £363.80) for 1 December 2016.
This meant that on 1 December 2016 Mr E was in advance of £72.00 (exclusive of charges)
and clear (inclusive of charges).
Mr Es payment by direct debit for 1 January 2017 (of £298.36) was returned unpaid. For this
failed direct debit payment Mr E was charged £18. This meant that on 12 January 2017 Mr E
was in arrears of £226.36 (exclusive of charges) and £316.36 in arrears (inclusive of
charges).
Mr E made the payment required of him by direct debit (of £298.36) for 1 February 2017.
Mr Es payment by direct debit for 1 March 2017 (of £298.36) was returned unpaid. For this
failed direct debit payment Mr E was charged £18. This meant that on 2 March 2017 Mr E
was in arrears of £524.72 (exclusive of charges) and £632.72 in arrears (inclusive of
charges).
Mr E made the payment required of him by direct debit (of £298.36) for 1 April 2017.
Mr Es payments by direct debit for 1 May 2017 and 1 June 2017 (of £298.36) were returned
unpaid. For these failed direct debit payments Mr E was charged £18. This meant that on
2 June 2017 Mr E was in arrears of £1,103.44 (exclusive of charges) and £1,229.44 in
arrears (inclusive of charges).
On 13 June 2017 Moneybarn issued Mr E with a Default Notice seeking repayment of
arrears of £1,229.44 to avoid termination of the agreement and repossession of the car.
Mr Es payment by direct debit for 1 July 2017 (of £298.36) was returned unpaid. This meant
that on 4 July 2017 Mr E was in arrears of £1,419.80 (exclusive of charges) and £1,545.80 in
arrears (inclusive of charges).
On 18 July 2017 Moneybarn terminated Mr Es agreement as it advised him it would under
cover of its 13 June 2017 Default Notice. At the time of termination, the outstanding balance
recorded in Moneybarns books was £7,811.36 with arrears noted of £1,545.80.
On 20 July 2017 Mr E complained to Moneybarn that it had been unfair and unreasonable in
terminating his agreement.
On 21 July 2017 Mr E made a manual payment of £200. This reduced the outstanding
balance recorded in Moneybarns books to £7,611.36.
On 17 August 2017 Moneybarn issued Mr E with a final response letter. Under cover of this
letter Moneybarn said it had nothing wrong in terminating Mr Es agreement and that if Mr E
wanted to retain possession of the car it might be possible for a consent order to be entered
into.
On 22 August 2017 £308.00 court costs were debited to Mr Es account.
On 29 September 2017 the car was collected from Mr E following his decision to voluntary
surrender it.
On 29 September 2017 the court decided Moneybarns money claim be adjourned with
liberty to restore and that Mr E should have to pay Moneybarns fixed costs in the sum of
£493.
On 2 October 2017 £185.00 court costs were debited to Mr Es account.On 5 October 2017 Mr E complained to Moneybarn that he had voluntary terminated his
agreement, so the balance recorded as being outstanding on his account was incorrect and
that court action wasnt necessary. He also complained that he was being sent post despite
his request not to be sent any and about how his agreement (including its termination) had
been recorded with various credit reference agencies.
On 10 October 2017 £225.00 recovery costs were debited to Mr Es account.
On 11 October 2017 £40.00 damage costs and £16.50 of auction fees were debited to
Mr Es account.
On 11 October 2017 £3,550.00 car disposal proceeds were credited to Mr Es account. This
meant that the outstanding balance recorded in Moneybarns books on 11 October 2017 was
£4,835.86.
On 15 November 2017 Moneybarn issued Mr E with a final response letter. Under cover of
this letter Moneybarn reiterated it had done nothing wrong in terminating Mr Es agreement.
It then went on to say that having been given three options, Mr E opted to voluntary
surrender the car and it was collected from him on 29 September 2017. It also said that
although Mr E would prefer to communicate by email there are occasions when
documentation would need to be sent by post and what it had recorded with credit reference
agencies in respect of the agreement was accurate and correct.
On 9 July 2019 £4,244.26 was credited to Mr Es account by Moneybarn. This meant that
the outstanding balance recorded in its books on 9 July 2019 was £591.60.
On 19 July 2019 Mr E complained to Moneybarn about the balance it was recording as still
being outstanding and due from him.
On 1 August 2019 Moneybarn amended the default balance it had recorded with one or
more credit reference agencies to £591.60.
On 10 September 2019 Moneybarn issued Mr E with a final response letter. Under cover of
this letter Moneybarn reiterated it had done nothing wrong in terminating Mr Es agreement
and that although Mr E agreed to voluntary surrender the car, a delay in Mr E actually
surrendering it meant court action went ahead as scheduled.
On 20 December 2019 a third party, that I will call A, purchased Mr Es debt from
Moneybarn. A appointed a further party, a party that I will call M, to manage the purchased
debt on its behalf.
On 6 January 2020 Mr E complained to Moneybarn again about various issues.
On 31 January 2020 Moneybarn issued Mr E with a final response letter. Under cover of this
letter Moneybarn said it had nothing further to add to what it had said under cover of its final
response letter dated 10 September 2020.
On 22 March 2020 A amended the default balance it had recorded with one or more credit
reference agencies to £591.60.In June 2020 Mr E paid M £591.60.
Mr Es complaint was considered by one of our investigators who ultimately concluded that:
Our service had already considered Mr Es complaint about Moneybarns decision to
terminate the agreement, so she wasnt looking at this again.
Our service had already considered Mr Es complaint about Moneybarns registration
of its default, so she wasnt looking at this again.
Having credited the account with £4,244.26, Moneybarn had done enough to
compensate Mr E for any shortcomings there might have been in its communication
about his agreement exit options and the financial consequences of each one.
Mr Es complaint about Moneybarn breaching GDPR needed to be taken up with the
ICO.
Mr E didnt agree. In summary he said:
He asked to voluntary terminate his agreement before it was terminated by
Moneybarn, not afterwards.
Moneybarn had no right to register his agreement as being in default with credit
reference agencies.
Its clearly wrong that both Moneybarn and A should be able to record the same debt
as being in default with credit reference agencies.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in August 2021. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Now Ive the power to dismiss a complaint, without considering the merits, in certain
circumstances  including where the subject matter of the complaint has been 
subject of court proceedings and where the subject matter of the complaint has 
previously been considered by our service.
But Im not obliged to dismiss a complaint in these circumstances. And taking 
everything into account I think its appropriate that I address everything Mr E is now 
complaining about in this one single decision.
But I would also like to make it clear that Im only considering in this decision Mr Es
complaint about Moneybarn. Im not considering any complaint Mr E might have 
about A or M.
Its clear Mr E has very strong feelings about this complaint. He has provided detailed
submissions in support of his view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in 
their entirety. However, I trust that Mr E will not take the fact that my findings focus 
on what I consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in 
considerably less detail, as a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to 
address every point raised. The purpose of my decision is to set out my conclusions 
and reasons for reaching them.I would also point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear or
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
termination of the agreement by Moneybarn on 18 July 2017
One of my fellow ombudsmen found in October 2018 that Moneybarn had done 
nothing wrong in terminating the agreement on 18 July 2017.
Now Ive looked at this aspect of Mr Es complaint again and can confirm that I dont
disagree with this finding.
Given what both parties have said and submitted Im satisfied that the reason why
Moneybarn terminated the agreement on 18 July 2017 was because following the 
issue of the Default Notice dated 13 June 2017 Mr E failed to contact and engage 
with it about the arrears position on his account. I would also add that Im satisfied 
that in terminating the agreement Moneybarn wasnt in breach of any of its 
obligations to Mr E, whether contractual, legal or regulatory.
did Mr E ask to voluntary terminate his agreement before 18 July 2017 and/or was he
deprived of this option by Moneybarn?
One of my fellow ombudsmen found in October 2018 that Moneybarn had done 
nothing wrong in terminating the agreement on 18 July 2017.
Now Ive looked at this aspect of Mr Es complaint again and can confirm that I dont
disagree with this finding.
Despite what Mr E says on this point Ive simply seen insufficient evidence to be able 
to conclude that he asked to voluntary terminate the agreement before 18 July 2017. 
Im also satisfied that once the agreement had been terminated by Moneybarn, 
Mr Es right to voluntary terminate the agreement no longer existed. I also think that 
its worth pointing out that had Mr E engaged with Moneybarn after the Default Notice 
had been issued, but prior to the agreement being terminated, the option of voluntary 
terminating the agreement may well have formed part of that engagement.
did Moneybarn act fairly and reasonably in how it dealt with Mr Es ultimate decision 
to voluntary surrender the car?
Based on what both parties have said and submitted Im satisfied that any delay in 
the car being collected from Mr E (under voluntary surrender) wasnt down to 
anything that Moneybarn did, or didnt do.
I would also point out that had Mr E agreed to the car being voluntary surrendered 
sooner than he did, he wouldnt have been put in the position of it being collected on 
the morning of 29 September 2017, the same date as a court hearing had been 
scheduled to consider one or more claims brought by Moneybarn against him.did Moneybarn act fairly and reasonably in not adjourning the court hearing set for
29 September 2017?
Given the car wasnt returned to Moneybarn until 29 September 2017, and given 
what I say above, I dont think it was unreasonable for Moneybarn to not seek an 
adjournment of the court hearing scheduled for 29 September 2017. However, I think 
its worth pointing out that Moneybarn took the decision to not seek a money order at 
this hearing (given the cars return) but simply sought a return of goods order and 
costs of £493.
are the charges debited to Mr Es account of £308, £185, £225, £40 and £16.50 fair 
and reasonable.
Ive considered the above costs and Im satisfied that they are all fair and reasonable 
in their nature and that Moneybarn was entitled to debit Mr Es account with them. I 
would also add that its my understanding that the costs of £493 (£308 plus £185) 
were costs awarded against Mr E by the court and that all the costs, in essence, 
have been refunded by virtue of the £4,244.26 credit to Mr Es account in July 2019.
action taken by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) against Moneybarn
My remit is to consider the facts of each individual complaint and reach a decision 
based on those facts. And this is what Ive done here.
I can understand why Mr E might view Moneybarns decision to credit his account 
with £4,244.26 in July 2019 as evidence that he asked to voluntary terminate his 
agreement before 18 July 2017, or that Moneybarn should have allowed him to do so 
on or before that date. But I dont agree.
Im satisfied that Mr E didnt ask to voluntary terminate his agreement before 
18 July 2017. Im also satisfied that although Moneybarn credited Mr Es account with 
£4,244.26 in July 2019, this in itself doesnt mean it should have treated the account 
on 18 July 2017 as being voluntary terminated rather than terminated by it.
Mr E was given a number of opportunities to engage with Moneybarn to come to an
arrangement to clear his arrears, or to agree an acceptable exit strategy  including
voluntary termination, but he didnt do so. And because he didnt do so, and with 
arrears approaching six monthly contractual payments, Im satisfied that Moneybarn 
acted entirely appropriately (and fairly and reasonably) in terminating the agreement.
For the sake of completeness I would also add that cant find any errors in 
Moneybarns calculation of the £4,244.26 credit to Mr Es account.
default registration by Moneybarn
One of my fellow ombudsmen found in October 2018 that Moneybarn had done 
nothing wrong in registering the default that it did against Mr E with third party credit 
reference agencies in 2017.
Now Ive looked at this aspect of Mr Es complaint again and can confirm that I dont
disagree with this finding and Ive nothing further to add in respect of it.However, I appreciate that things have moved on since 2017 with Moneybarn 
amending the default balance it initially recorded with third party credit reference 
agencies in 2017 to £591.60 on 1 August 2019 and with A amending what appears to 
be the same defaulted debt (recorded by it) to £591.60 on 22 March 2020.
Now its my understanding that Mr Es debt was purchased by A from Moneybarn on
20 December 2019. So with this in mind Im satisfied that Moneybarn acted entirely 
correctly  and not to Mr Es disadvantage  in amending its recorded default 
balance with third party credit reference agencies to £591.60 in August 2020.
Now I can understand Mr Es frustration in discovering what would appear to be his
amended default balance of £591.60 being registered by both Moneybarn and A. But 
this is, in my view, something that he needs to take up with A because I cant see 
that there has been any error on the part of Moneybarn in this respect.
correspondence sent to Mr E by Moneybarn by post rather than by email
I accept that Mr E asked for all correspondence to be sent to him by email, rather 
than by post. But as explained by Moneybarn much, if not all, of the correspondence 
it sent Mr E by post was required to be sent by post. But even if I wasnt of this view 
Im not persuaded that being sent correspondence by post, rather than email, 
warrants in itself the making of an award by me. I say this because although I accept 
this might have been frustrating for Mr E Im not persuaded it would have caused him 
material distress and inconvenience.
correspondence sent to Mr E by Moneybarn to an incorrect address
Based on what both parties have said and submitted Ive seen insufficient evidence 
to be able to conclude that Moneybarn sent any correspondence to Mr E at an 
address other than ones he asked correspondence to be sent to.
GDPR breaches by Moneybarn
As pointed out by the investigator its not the role of this service to decide whether a
business has breached GDPR. That would be for the regulator, the ICO to decide. I
therefore leave it with Mr E to bring his concerns in this respect to the attention of the 
ICO if he wishes.
Bearing in mind what I say above, Im not persuaded Moneybarn has done anything 
wrong in this case or that it needs to anything.
Moneybarn didnt respond to my provisional decision.
Mr E responded to my provisional decision to say that it was completely and utterly 
contradicting in every manner and that our service should not reply to [him] in any way 
shape or form and that [we should] not contact [him] again.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that Moneybarn didnt respond to my provisional decision and given that Mr E has 
provided nothing materially new for my consideration, I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional findings and I now confirm them as final.My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 October 2021.
