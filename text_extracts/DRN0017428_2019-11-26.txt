K820x#14Complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) made a payment to an online 
auction service without his consent. 
Background
Mr M sold an item via an online auction service  (the third party) on 28 November 2018. A 
buyer dispute was filed on 14 February  2019 and the payment  was refunded on 
25 February 2019. Mr M went on to complain  to PayPal that the third party had issued a 
refund outside  the time allowed in its disputes process. 
Mr M complained but PayPal didnt return the payment. PayPal said it had acted in line with 
the terms Mr M had accepted when he opened his account.  An adjudicator at our service  
looked at Mr Ms complaint but also felt PayPal  refunded the payment to the third party 
correctly. Mr M asked  to appeal so his complaint  has been passed to me to make  a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr M says that the third partys terms say a buyer  dispute can only be raised within  30 days 
of the purchase. But this complaint relates  to PayPal, not the third party. So Ive focused on 
Mr Ms PayPal  account and the terms that govern it to decide  whether a mistake has been 
made. 
PayPal says that on 4 May 2015  Mr M accepted  its terms agreed  that it could automatically 
debit funds from his account if instructed to do so by the third party after he provided 
advance authorisation for automatic payments. The systems evidence  Ive seen confirms 
that. PayPals terms say that by providing  automatic payment  agreement  Mr M: 
-Gives the third party the ability  to collect or reverse fixed or variable  amount 
payments from your Account on one time basis, or on a recurring  basis
-Hereby authorises and instructs PayPal to pay the third party from your PayPal 
Account amounts you owe as presented to us by the third party  
Looking at the terms, Im satisfied theres provision for PayPal to automatically take 
payments from Mr Ms account. 
The terms provide  further information about the risk of a payment being  reversed.  The terms 
say Payments received  in your PayPal Account  may be reversed  at a later time,  for 
example, if such a payment is subject to a Chargeback, Reversal, Claim or otherwise 
invalidated
I understand Mr Ms point  and that he feels that PayPal  has allowed the third party to issue  a 
refund outside  of the timescales for disputed  payments. But theres nothing in the terms that 
involves PayPal in that process.  The terms say PayPal will pay the third party  on request as 
Mr M agreed  to make automatic payments. PayPal has acted in line with the terms. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Mr M but I havent  found  anything to show  PayPal made a mistake in 
this case. So Im not telling to take any further  action. 
Ref: DRN00174282My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 December  2019.
