The complaint
Miss R complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (Aqua) didnt refund fraudulent 
payments to her account or adjust the interest.
What happened
Miss R had an Aqua credit card. In March 2018, there were suspected fraudulent 
transactions on her account. Her card was stopped on 9 March 2018. This was lifted on 22 
March 2018. The transactions remained on her account. On 16 March 2018, Miss R 
complained about the stop on her account. Miss R contacted Aqua again about the 
transactions on 12 June 2020. There were seven suspect payments totalling £1764.89. 
Aqua refunded three payments totalling £842.89  in June 2020. The balance was then 
£5806.59 debit. In June 2019 and October 2019, Aqua sent Notices of Default. In February 
2020, they sent Notice of Registration of the default. The outstanding balance is now 
£4,881.44.
Miss R complained  that if Aqua had made the refunds of the fraudulent transactions when 
they should have - in March 2018 and adjusted the interest  she would have been able to 
make the payments to the card. Therefore, the defaults on her credit file were unfair and 
should be removed. She said the adjustment of interest hadnt been made.
Aqua said they didnt have any record of contact with Miss R about the suspect transactions 
in March 2018. But theyd refunded the three payments for £842.89 as, with the elapse of 
time, they didnt have enough information to investigate them. So, they made the decision to 
refund them. But they were satisfied that the others were made by Miss R and didnt refund 
those. During our investigation, they realised they had made an error as they hadnt adjusted 
the interest for the payments made  and offered to refund £755.15 for this. They also 
admitted some service failings in not dealing with Miss Rs complaint in time and in full. And 
offered compensation of £150 for this. But they said that Miss R hadnt made the contractual 
payments to her account, or to the payment arrangements that had been agreed  and 
therefore the default on her credit file should remain.
Miss R rejected Aquas offer  and brought her complaint to us.  Her main request was that 
the default on her credit file be removed. She said she refused to make any more payments 
to Aqua until the defaults were removed. Our investigator said Aqua had acted reasonably. 
Miss R was still required to make the minimum payments to her account. There wasnt a 
sufficient link between the disputed transactions in March 2018, and the default which 
occurred two years later. In March 2018 to June 2018  Miss R was within her limits  and 
so, whether the transactions were refunded, or not - at that stage - wasnt relevant. And, 
Miss R continued to use the card  so couldve followed up with Aqua on the fraud claims. 
She had stopped making payments to the card in April 2019, and given what hed seen, 
Aqua were correct in applying the defaults when they did.
Miss R disagreed and asked that an ombudsman look at her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of Miss Rs complaint is that Aqua shouldve refunded her with the fraudulent 
transactions of £842.89 in March 2018. And  In June 2020, they should have refunded 
interest charged of £755.15 on those payments  because her debt was too high  by 
£842.89 - as a result of the delay in the refunds. So, I must decide whether  if she had had 
the benefit of the £842.89 in March 2018 and had paid £755.15 less interest between then 
and June 2020  whether things would have been different. Effectively, by June 2020, Miss 
R would argue that her debt was higher by £1598.04 than it shouldve been.
In considering Miss Rs complaint, let me say that Ive reviewed all of her and Aquas letters 
about this and her other complaints. But I am only going to refer to whats necessary to deal 
with Miss Rs specific complaint here.
Aqua took a commercial decision to refund the disputed transactions in June 2020  
because they hadnt got the information from two years before. So  that worked to Miss Rs 
benefit, and I think that Aqua acted fairly here. Aqua say they didnt have any record of 
contact with her in March 2018  other than that she had complained that her account had 
been stopped because of the suspected payments. This was then lifted. I must say that I find 
it odd that Miss R didnt raise the matter with Aqua again for over two years  when she had 
been receiving monthly statements, arrears letters and Notices of Default (all of which Ive 
seen) during that period. 
Looking ahead to what happened later  in April 2019, Miss R stopped making payments to 
the card. I can see she was then in arrears and was sent arrears letters as follows:
Letter Date Arrears Amount Balance of Credit 
CardAccount Limit
20 May 2019 £259.49 £6,580.37 £6,200
10 June 2019 £259.49 £6,592.37 £6,200
11 July 2019 £197.89 £6,194.95 £6,200
12 August 2019 £278.92 £6,200 £6,200
23 September 2019 £251.04 £6,290.32 £6,200
In July 2019, August 2019 and September 2019, she missed payments. In June 2019, Aqua 
sent a Notice of Default for £503.26. In August 2019, Aqua agreed a payment arrangement 
of £283 per month. But this wasnt kept to and they sent another Notice of Default in October 
2019 for £496.06. In February 2020  Aqua sent a notice to say the default would be 
registered within 28 days. In July 2020, Aqua agreed another payment arrangement of £170 
per month. Ive seen that one payment was made, but no more after that. I agree with our 
investigator that  no matter what happened, Miss R was obliged to make the minimum 
monthly payments to her account  but she didnt. 
In considering whether the defaults were advised correctly, we follow the guidance from the 
Information Commissioners Office (ICO) says when a consumer is at least three
months behind with their payments then a default may be registered. And it would expect a
default to be registered by the time the consumer is six months behind with their payments.
And  I can see that because Miss R was so far in arrears, they were justified in defaulting 
Miss Rs account.
Aqua say they didnt get any contact from Miss R about the disputed amounts  until June 
2020. So  I dont think its fair to expect them to have done anything differently.In matters such as this, I must make a decision based on the probabilities of what might 
have happened and in the circumstances of Miss Rs complaint. And looking at what 
happened here, Im not persuaded that Miss R wouldve acted any differently had she had 
the money (£1598.04) earlier. 
Ive considered whether Miss R couldve made the payments to the account if she had had 
the benefit of the amount in question - £1598.04  since March 2018. Ive looked at the 
minimum contractual payments needed on her account. For five months between January 
2019 and May 2019  these averaged £261 per month  so, thats over £3,100 in a year. So, 
thats obviously a lot more than the money she might have had available to her. So - I think 
its unlikely that it wouldve made a lot of difference in terms of how things played out.
And  Miss R had the chance to raise the issue of the refunds several times during the two 
years between March 2018 and June 2020  but she didnt. Aqua have confirmed that.
And so  my final decision is to not uphold this complaint. If Miss R still wishes to receive the 
interest refund of £755.15, and compensation of £150, she should get in touch with Aqua to 
arrange this to be paid to her. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 September 2021.
