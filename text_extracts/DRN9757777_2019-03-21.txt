K820x#14complaint
Ms E complains  that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA didnt do enough after she complained 
about not receiving  a purchase shed made.
background
At the end of 2017 Ms E paid for two items from the same seller. One of the items arrived 
but the one other didnt. She contacted  PayPal  but it told her the seller  had given it the 
tracking number of the missing item. So it closed  her case. She said there wasnt any 
evidence of the tracking number of the missing item and she wants  PayPal to refund her the 
cost of her purchase. 
PayPal said it had contacted the seller who had given it a tracking  number (ending in 7960). 
It used that information  to track the item and found  itd been delivered.
Our investigator could  see from the tracking information  that the item had been delivered  so 
he didnt think PayPal  had done anything wrong.
Ms E wasnt happy with this. She said the tracking number PayPal had used was for the item 
that she received  and not for the missing  item.  Our investigator went back  to PayPal who 
said the tracking number  for the item Ms E said shed received ended  in 7962.
Ms E said she checked both numbers on the couriers website and although  the status was 
showing that the items had been delivered and signed for by her she could only see one 
signature. So she didnt accept there was sufficient  evidence  to show  shed  received  the 
missing item.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  In doing so Ive come  to the same 
conclusion as our investigator  for very similar reasons. And theres very little else I can add.
I can see that the tracking information  on the purchase Ms E says she didnt receive  shows 
that the item was delivered  and signed  for on 4 January 2018. Ms E complains that the 
couriers website doesnt show her signature but that is not the responsibility of PayPal. 
PayPal was entitled to rely on the tracking information. So I dont think PayPal was at fault 
for closing  her case and not refunding her the cost of the purchase.  
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 April 2019.
