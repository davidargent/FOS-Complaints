The complaint
Mrs L complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Debenhams Mastercard unfairly filed a default 
with credit reference agencies about her account.
What happened
Mrs L had a credit card account with NewDay. She says she purchased an item in July 
2019 using her card. She wasnt satisfied with the item. She returned it and raised a 
dispute with NewDay. NewDay applied a temporary refund to her account in October 2019 
but later reversed that refund.
Mrs L complained to NewDay about what happened (the First Complaint). It upheld her 
complaint. It said it shouldve sent her documentation received from the merchant and it 
hadnt passed the case to the team which dealt with complaints raised under s.75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act. It agreed to pay her £50 by way of compensation and refunded four 
£12 charges which had been applied to her account. NewDays final response letter was 
dated 19 March 2020.
NewDay issued a default notice on 11 May 2020. It said that Mrs L had to pay the amount 
outstanding by 16 May 2020 otherwise her account would be defaulted. Mrs L complained 
to NewDay about this (the Second Complaint). It issued a final response letter dated 15 
June 2020.
The final response letter referred to the previous letter of 19 March 2020. It said it was 
still awaiting a response from the s.75 team and she would be contacted by that team. 
But, it said in the meantime shed still have to pay the monthly payments and regulatory 
letters would still be issued to her.
Mrs L was sent a further letter dated 12 August 2020. It said the default was going to be 
filed with credit reference agencies. She says she phoned NewDay about this letter and it 
told her it was a mistake. She says she heard nothing further from NewDay.
In June 2021 Mrs L says she applied for credit to purchase a car. Her application was 
refused and she was told about the default registered by NewDay. Mrs L complained again 
to NewDay (the Third Complaint).
NewDay investigated her complaint. It sent its final response letter on 22 July 2021. It said 
that in its response to the First Complaint it had agreed to refund four £12 charges to her 
account  but it hadnt told her it would remove any negative information recorded on her 
credit file. In its response to her Second Complaint it had reminded her that she still 
needed to pay the minimum monthly payments to her account. She hadnt done that. It 
said it was obliged to report factually correct information to credit reference agencies. In 
the circumstances, it said it couldnt remove the default that had been filed.
Mrs L wasnt satisfied with this response. She complained to our service in July 2021.
Our investigator looked into her complaint. He thought that our service couldnt consider 
the First Complaint or the Second Complaint because Mrs L hadnt referred either of those 
complaints to our service within six months of the date of the final response letters sent by 
NewDay. He also considered whether there were any exceptional circumstances which 
prevented Mrs L from referring her complaints within the six-month period. But, he said he 
hadnt been told about any exceptional circumstances. So, he said that all he could 
consider was whether the default had been fairly applied.
Our investigator reviewed the statements for the account. He was satisfied Mrs L had been 
behind with her payments for a considerable time. He said wed generally expect a default 
to be added where three to six months of arrears had built up. So, he didnt think NewDay 
had done anything wrong when it had filed the default. He considered what Mrs L had told 
us about NewDay informing her the default was a mistake. He thought NewDay had given 
her incorrect information when it told her this. He didnt uphold the complaint.
Mrs L didnt agree. So, the complaint was passed to me to decide.
NewDay gave this service its consent to investigate the First, Second and Third 
Complaints. 
I issued a provisional decision in which I said:
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to 
decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint.
As mentioned above, NewDay has now given our service consent to 
consider the First, Second and Third Complaints. So, I can consider all of 
those complaints in this provisional decision.
The account entries
Ive reviewed the statements of account and related correspondence sent to 
Mrs L. The statements show that the balance in the account, at December 
2019, after the temporary refund was reversed was just over £189. After her 
First Complaint was referred to NewDay it made certain adjustments to her 
account  including crediting the £50 it had given her by way of 
compensation. This left the balance at just over £137.
Along with her April 2020 statement Mrs L was sent a Notice of Sums in 
Arrears. This notice informed her that her account was in arrears and she 
needed to take action to avoid having to pay more in interest and charges. 
She was also told that missed payments could affect her credit rating.
Mrs L didnt make any payments and a further Notice of Sums in Arrears 
was issued in June. It was at this time that Mrs L raised her Second 
Complaint. She said she didnt want to be sent any further demands or 
letters in relation to payments. The final response letter made clear 
NewDay wasnt upholding the Second Complaint. It said that although the 
disputed payment was still being considered under s.75 of the Consumer 
Credit Act 
you still have to pay the contractual minimum payment to maintain 
the account, as per the terms of your credit agreement.Further statements were issued to Mrs L. And further Notices of Sums in 
Arrears were sent to her. She didnt make any further payments to the 
account.
NewDay sent her a letter in August 2020 informing her that it was going to 
register the default with credit reference agencies. Mrs L says she 
contacted NewDay at this time  Ill comment further about that below. 
She didnt make any payments to the account and the default was 
registered in September 2020.
Having looked at the statements and the correspondence sent to Mrs L, 
Im satisfied, on balance, NewDay had made it clear to her she needed 
to continue to make the monthly payments to avoid a default being 
registered.
When thinking about whether, in light of everything that happened here, 
NewDay acted fairly and reasonably when it decided to go ahead and 
register the default, my provisional finding about the information in the 
correspondence sent to Mrs L needs to be considered together with the 
comments Ive made below about the telephone contact between NewDay 
and Mrs L. A default has a significant adverse impact on a consumers credit 
file.
The telephone call Mrs L says she made to NewDay in August 2020
Ive thought about what Mrs L told us about a telephone call she says she 
made to NewDay in August 2020. NewDay hasnt been able to provide a 
copy of this call recording. It says it only retains call recordings for twelve 
months. So, Ive had to rely on the notes it made on its systems about what 
was said during this call.
Mrs L had been in touch with NewDay on several occasions in 2020. I can 
see a record of a telephone conversation in March. Mrs L told NewDay 
about certain personal matters which affected her health and wellbeing. She 
also explained that she didnt want to get any more letters because shed 
been advised by the fraud team that while the dispute was outstanding shed 
not be sent any further letters. The records state:
Advised customer that letter was dated same day as when 
customer called and got confirmation of the letters no longer being 
sent. Did not discuss any QA as customer advised of several 
occasions she cannot deal with this as it is causing her stress 
Does not want any impact on credit file..
There were further calls in April and May. There is also a note of a call in 
August 2020. The note states:
CH (customer) is very angry at the fact that she has received a 
default notice  and is disputing that balance on the account. The 
account is closed and U blocked  completed the out of hours 
complaints form.
The records dont indicate that Mrs L was told the letter dated 12 August 
had been sent in error. But, having read all of the notes here, I can 
understand why Mrs L wouldve thought that her complaint was still being investigated or would be progressed further. Theres no indication that 
after completing its out of hours complaint form, NewDay made contact 
with Mrs L again.
So, having thought about the information on NewDays records, the 
sequence of events and Mrs Ls own testimony here, I can understand why 
she wouldve thought NewDay was going to look at everything again  
including the default it had told her it intended to register with credit 
reference agencies.
The balance outstanding on the account
It is the case that the balance outstanding on Mrs Ls account was made up 
of the amount of the disputed transaction, less the compensation payment of 
£50.
In its final response letter dated March 2020, NewDay accepted it hadnt 
given Mrs L a copy of the documentation it had received from the merchant. 
Ive looked at that documentation. I can see that the merchant offered to 
settle Mrs Ls dispute by refunding £70 to her. That offer was made by the 
merchant on 21 October 2019 in its response to the chargeback request. 
NewDay has confirmed to our service it hasnt shared this piece of 
information with Mrs L. It was important information and I dont think 
NewDay acted fairly and reasonably when it didnt copy this information to 
Mrs L for her consideration.
Ive also noted that NewDay told Mrs L, in its letter dated July 2020, it was 
still considering the s.75 aspect of the disputed payment. From what Ive 
seen that information was incorrect. NewDays records show it had already 
decided in January 2020 not to progress the s.75 aspect of the complaint. 
So, it provided her with incorrect information in its letter dated June 2020.
Having considered everything, Im satisfied on balance, Mrs L may have 
acted differently here, if shed been told about the £70 offer from the 
merchant and the fact that her s.75 claim couldnt be progressed.
In these circumstances, despite the fact that NewDay sent Mrs L 
statements of account and other notices, I currently dont think it was fair 
and reasonable to record a default with credit reference agencies.
What needs to be done to put things right
In order to put things right, I think NewDay needs to remove the default and 
any adverse information its recorded with credit reference agencies. It 
should also pay Mrs L £70 and credit that amount to her account with effect 
from the date the merchant made that offer (21 October 2019). It should 
then re-work the account  including making any refunds and payments its 
already offered to make as set out in its final response dated March 2020. 
No interest or charges should be added after 21 October 2019.
The revised statement of account should be provided to Mrs L. She should 
be given a period of one month from the date of that statement to settle the 
account or to agree a repayment plan with NewDay. If the amount 
outstanding is not repaid in full or if a repayment plan is not agreed with 
NewDay then NewDay can follow its usual process to deal with accounts in 
arrears.Ive considered whether NewDay should also be required to pay 
Mrs L compensation for any distress or inconvenience shes experienced. 
Shes told us about her embarrassment when her application for credit was 
declined. And, I can also see that Mrs L had informed NewDay about her 
personal circumstances which included details about her health and 
wellbeing. In these circumstances, I think NewDays actions here have 
caused additional distress for Mrs L. Shes also been embarrassed when an 
application for credit was declined. And, shes been inconvenienced by 
having to raise these matters with NewDay over a protracted period of time.
Having considered everything here, I think NewDay should pay 
Mrs L £200 by way of compensation for the distress and inconvenience 
shes experienced as a result of whats happened.
My provisional decision
For the reasons given above my provisional decision is that I intend to 
uphold this complaint about NewDay Ltd trading as Debenhams Mastercard.
I intend to require NewDay Ltd trading as Debenhams Mastercard to take 
the following action:
Remove the default and any adverse information its recorded with 
credit reference agencies about Mrs Ls account;
Credit £70 to Mrs Ls account with effect from 21 October 2019;
Re-work the account, applying any refunds its already agreed to 
make as set out in its letter dated 19 March 2020, and provide the 
updated statement to Mrs L;
Give Mrs L a period of one month to settle the account. If the 
account is not settled within the period of one month and/or Mrs L 
has not agreed a repayment plan with NewDay Ltd by the end of 
the period of one month, NewDay Ltd can commence its usual 
arrears collection process; and
Pay Mrs L £200 by way of compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience shes been caused as a result of whats happened.
Mrs L accepted my provisional decision. She reiterated that shed experienced distress and 
inconvenience because of what happened. She said she just wanted NewDay to leave her 
alone and stop calling her or sending her debt collection letters.
NewDay disagreed with my provisional decision. It made the following comments:
Mrs L had breached the terms and conditions for the account when she 
hadnt made any payments after December 2019. In these circumstances, 
NewDay had acted fairly when it recorded the default with credit reference 
agencies
NewDay said it didnt accept that Mrs L may have acted differently if shed 
known about the merchants offer. It said the notice of default was issued in 
February which was prior to the date of its final response letter.
NewDay said the merchant had indicated Mrs L hadnt responded to its offers. 
So, there was nothing to indicate she wouldve acted differently even if 
NewDay had shared that information with her.
NewDay said its notes about the phone call in August 2020 hadnt stated it 
told Mrs L the notice of intention to file a default was a mistake. And, it said it 
was very unlikely its collections team would have told her that. NewDay accepted it hadnt raised a complaint following the call in August 
2020. It offered its apologies for that but it said that even if a complaint had 
been raised at that time the default would still have been filed.
So, I now have to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive carefully considered everything NewDay has said here. But, it doesnt change my view 
that this complaint should be upheld. Ill explain why.
In my provisional decision, I said that NewDay had sent Mrs L correspondence about the 
default. It had sent her the notice of default in February 2020 and a notice in August 2020 
telling her it intended to register the default. But, I also said that these notices needed to be 
considered together with the comments I made about the telephone contact between 
NewDay and Mrs L. 
I remain of the view that the notices need to be considered in context. 
Mrs L disputed a payment thatd been taken from her account. NewDay had raised a 
chargeback but it hadnt been successful. Mrs L complained about that and NewDay 
accepted in its letter dated March 2020 it hadnt sent her the documents it had received from 
the merchant. But, even at that stage, it still didnt send her the documents so that she could 
read them for herself. NewDays records indicate that Mrs L continued to raise complaints 
with it throughout the period after March 2020  in April, May and again in August. 
The telephone call in August was in direct response to the letter Mrs L had received notifying 
her that NewDay intended to register the default. As I said in my provisional decision 
NewDays records didnt indicate it had told Mrs L the letter it had sent her was a mistake. 
But, having read all of the notes on her file, I was persuaded, on balance that Mrs L wouldve 
thought her complaint was still being investigated and would be progressed further. I remain 
of that view.
NewDay acknowledges now that it didnt progress her complaint at that time. It says that 
wouldnt have made any difference to its decision to register the default. But, Im not 
persuaded that given the opportunity to look at everything again, the outcome wouldnt have 
been different. And in any case, NewDay wouldve been able to inform Mrs L about the 
outcome of her complaint if it had been progressed. As I said in my provisional decision, I 
can understand why Mrs L wouldve thought her complaint was still being investigated or 
would be progressed further.
Ive also thought about what NewDay says about Mrs L not having responded to offers which 
the merchant made to her. It says, because she didnt respond to those offers, theres no 
reason to believe she wouldve done anything differently if NewDay had shared the 
merchants documents with her.
But, having read the merchants comments in the chargeback response it is clear that whilst 
some previous offer(s) may have been made by the merchant, the offer of £70 hadnt been. 
The merchant stated:Now we decide to refund the buyer £70. If the buyer agree with it, please refund him 
£70 directly; if he denies it, please let the buyer keep the items in original condition 
and mail back via Royal mail only 
So, Im satisfied NewDay shouldve made Mrs L aware of this new offer. It didnt. 
NewDay also accepts it didnt make Mrs L aware it had decided not to progress her s.75 
claim. 
Having considered everything again, I havent changed my view that Mrs L may have acted 
differently had she been made aware of the merchants offer and the fact that her s.75 claim 
wasnt going to be progressed. 
NewDay couldve provided the merchants documents, which included details of the £70 
offer, in November 2019. It  provided Mrs L with incorrect information in June 2020 when it 
told her the s.75 claim was still being progressed. NewDay also had the opportunity when 
Mrs L complained in August 2020, to look at everything again, before it proceeded to register 
the default  but it accepts it didnt do that. So, I dont think, taking everything into account, 
NewDay has acted fairly and reasonably here. 
Ive noted what Mrs L told us about the distress shes experienced because of everything 
thats happened. She says she doesnt want any more debt letters from NewDay. 
In order to resolve matters, I asked both Mrs L and NewDay to comment on whether any 
amount outstanding on Mrs Ls account could be deducted from the compensation payment I 
had provisionally decided should be paid to her. Neither NewDay nor Mrs L raised any 
objection. 
In my provisional decision I said that no interest or charges should be added to the account 
after 21 October 2019. So, I asked both Mrs L and NewDay for their comments if I was to 
direct that the complaint should be resolved in the following way. This was set out in an 
email from our service dated 22 February 2022:
The complaint would be upheld and NewDay would be required to take the following 
action:
remove the default and any adverse information its recorded with credit 
reference agencies about Mrs Ls account. 
Credit £70 to Mrs Ls account with effect from 21 October 2019;
Re-work the account, applying any refunds NewDay has already agreed to 
make as set out in its letter dated 19 March 2020, and provide the 
updated statement to Mrs L; and
Pay Mrs L £200 by way of compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience shes been caused as a result of whats happened. 
NewDay may deduct the amount outstanding on Mrs Ls account, after it 
has been re-worked, from this amount of £200 before it is paid to her. If 
the amount outstanding is greater than £200, NewDay should write that 
amount off and mark the account as settled and closed. If the amount 
outstanding is less than £200, NewDay should pay the difference to Mrs L.
I said it wasnt clear what the outstanding balance would be after the account was re-
worked. But, in light of everything Mrs L had told us about her circumstances, I thought that if 
the debt was greater than £200 it should be written off and the account marked as settled 
and closed. That would mean Mrs L wouldnt receive any more debt letters from NewDay.Mrs L raised no objection to this. NewDay didnt provide any further comments. 
Putting things right
Having considered everything here, Ive decided that NewDay should be required to take the 
following actions to resolve this complaint:
remove the default and any adverse information its recorded with credit 
reference agencies about Mrs Ls account. 
Credit £70 to Mrs Ls account with effect from 21 October 2019;
Re-work the account, applying any refunds NewDay has already agreed to 
make as set out in its letter dated 19 March 2020, and provide the 
updated statement to Mrs L; and
Pay Mrs L £200 by way of compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience shes been caused as a result of whats happened. 
NewDay may deduct the amount outstanding on Mrs Ls account, after it 
has been re-worked, from this amount of £200 before it is paid to her. If 
the amount outstanding is greater than £200, NewDay should write that 
amount off and mark the account as settled and closed. If the amount 
outstanding is less than £200, NewDay should pay the difference to Mrs L.
My final decision
For the reasons given above I uphold this complaint about NewDay Ltd trading as 
Debenhams Mastercard.
I now require NewDay Ltd to take the following action:
Remove the default and any adverse information it has recorded 
with credit reference agencies about Mrs Ls account;
Credit £70 to Mrs Ls account with effect from 21 October 2019;
Re-work the account, applying any refunds NewDay Ltd has 
already agreed to make as set out in its letter dated 19 March 
2020, and provide the updated statement to Mrs L; and
Pay Mrs L £200 by way of compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience shes been caused as a result of whats happened. 
NewDay Ltd may deduct the amount outstanding on Mrs Ls 
account, after it has been re-worked, from this amount of £200 
before it is paid to her. If the amount outstanding is greater than 
£200, NewDay should write that amount off and mark the account 
as settled and closed. If the amount outstanding is less than £200, 
NewDay should pay the difference to Mrs L.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 April 2022.
