The complaint
Mr A complains about the amount of interest that hes been charged by BMW Financial 
Services (GB) Limited for a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr A under a hire purchase agreement with BMW Financial 
Services in September 2020. Mr A asked for a settlement quote in December 2021 and he 
paid £25,228.83 to settle the agreement in January 2022  but the settlement quote had 
been calculated on the basis that the December 2021 monthly instalment was paid and Mr A 
had cancelled his direct debit instruction so that payment wasnt made. BMW Financial 
Services contacted him about the missing payment of £531.38 but he then complained to it 
about the payment that he was being asked to make. 
It said that the settlement quote was generated inclusive of Mr Ks December 2021 payment 
and his agreement was showing as settled but the December 2021 payment was 
outstanding. Mr A paid the £531.38 to BMW Financial Services but wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that she 
hadnt seen any evidence to show that BMW Financial Services had calculated the 
settlement figure incorrectly and she was satisfied that the settlement figure was only valid if 
the December 2021 payment was also paid.
Mr A has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that he thinks that hes paid too much interest.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
the hire purchase agreement shows that the price of the car was £30,490, a deposit 
of £420 was paid, the amount of credit that was provided to Mr A was £30,070 and 
interest of £7,032.88 was payable  Mr A agreed to make 48 monthly payments of 
£531.38 for the car to be supplied to him and there was an optional final repayment 
of £11,596.64;
Mr A asked for a settlement quote in December 2021 and the quote that was 
provided to him said that the amount required to settle the agreement was 
£29,132.18, but there was an interest rebate of £3,903.35 so the amount that Mr A 
would have to pay was £25,228.83;
I consider that it was clear from the settlement quote that it had been calculated on 
the basis that the December 2021 monthly payment of £531.38 was also made;
Mr A paid the £25,228.83 to settle his agreement but hed cancelled his direct debit 
instruction before the December 2021 was made so his account was £531.38 in 
arrears  Mr A has paid that amount to BMW Financial Services but says that he 
thinks that hes paid too much interest;
the interest payable for the full term of the agreement was £7,032.88 but, because he 
settled the agreement early, there was an interest rebate of £3,903.35 so the amount 
of interest that Mr A paid was £3,129.53;
although Mr A says that he thinks that hes paid too much interest, he hasnt provided 
a detailed explanation as to why he thinks that or any calculations to show the 
amount of interest that he thinks that he should have paid;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that BMW Financial 
Services has calculated the settlement figure incorrectly or that Mr A has paid BMW 
Financial Services more than he should have done for the car; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
BMW Financial Services to refund to Mr A any of the money that hes paid to it, to 
pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2022.
