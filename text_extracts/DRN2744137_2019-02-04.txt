K821x#15complaint
Ms L complains that she got poor service when she sought help using a motor breakdown 
policy underwritten by U K Insurance Limited  (UKI). 
background
Ms L was driving on a motorway  in January 2018  at 8.30pm when a warning light showed  
the car was overheating. She parked on the hard shoulder and waited two hours for a 
recovery agent to arrive. He took Ms L and her car to a service station. Ms L says he told her 
he wasnt a mechanic, and that his shift had ended,  but he still checked the engine quickly. 
Before leaving,  he diagnosed a faulty water pump, which  meant the car wasnt driveable.
The recovery firm told Ms L shed have  to pay £280  for recovery  to her home,  some  70 miles 
away. Her cover under the policy was limited  to roadside help or recovery  within 10 miles.  
A second agent didnt arrive  until two hours  later, so Ms L didnt get home until 2.30am. 
Later that day, a local recovery agent checked the car. Ms L says he said it only had a faulty 
sensor and would have been  driveable the previous night.  A local garage  confirmed  the 
agents view that there  was no mechanical damage. So Ms L assumed the first recovery 
agent misled her, in order to charge for a home recovery.
The recovery service apologised to Ms L for the long waiting times for assistance. She 
accepted £200 compensation from it for the upset  and inconvenience shed faced. But it 
didnt agree that the first recovery agent had done anything  wrong.  It said he was a qualified 
mechanic and that hed looked at the engine whilst the car was on the hard shoulder. Hed 
seen steam rising  from it, plus a pool of water  underneath  the car. So in his view there were 
clear signs  of overheating apart  from the warning light.
UKI later said that despite the wrong  diagnosis, the symptoms the agent found meant a 
home recovery was needed.  It said had he diagnosed  just the faulty  sensor, it wouldnt have 
been advisable  to drive on. It said any fault that may have developed later may have been  
masked. It said agents werent paid to recommend recoveries. Ms Ls husband,  Mr S, told 
UKI that Ms L may have  driven on, given the right diagnosis. He said steam  couldnt  have 
been rising from the engine  - it had been  switched off for two hours when the agent arrived.    
Our adjudicator noted that Ms L was happy  with the compensation shed got for delay. He 
thought the first agent should  have been able to find the correct  fault quickly,  just as the 
second one did. But he wasnt certain whether Ms L would have driven home,  so he thought 
UKI should pay half the cost of the recovery. UKI said home recovery  would still have been 
the safest option, with just a faulty  sensor.  And it said the fault was easier to find when the 
car wasnt at the side of a motorway, when its engine was cold and there  was no water  loss.
As there was no agreement, the complaint was passed to me for review. 
Ref: DRN27441372my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think there was a misunderstanding  about  whether the first recovery  agent was a qualified 
mechanic. Ms Ls given  us a transcript of text messages between  her and Mr S on the night 
of the breakdown. She texted Mr S soon after she got to the service station and said the 
agent wasnt qualified.  Yet the recovery service assured  UKI he was  and it didnt doubt his 
diagnosis of the fault at the time. The second  recovery agent didnt make any checks  at all to 
confirm it. So I think its likely the first agent  was a qualified  mechanic.
The text notes say he didnt check the car whilst it was on the hard shoulder.  I think thats 
likely to be accurate. The notes say he looked  at the engine at the service  station before 
leaving. It seems thats where he diagnosed a faulty water pump  although theres nothing 
in the texts about steam or loss of water having been noted at the time.  The water pump 
proved not to be faulty  and there  was no other mechanical fault. So I dont think its clear 
how the agent was able to note those symptoms. 
I can see why Ms L thinks he should have noted the correct fault. It seems he wasnt 
constrained by working on the hard shoulder, as UKI thought. And it only took the other  
agent a few minutes to find it. That was in daylight - but I think  the service stations likely to 
have been well-lit.  UKI says the engine would  have been cold the next day and there 
wouldnt have been any water escaping. But I dont think theres persuasive evidence  that 
either of those issues would have applied  at the service station. 
I dont think Ms L has shown that the first agent  misled her in order to ensure  the recovery 
service was paid for a home delivery.  But I think he made an error.  I think  its fair to say that 
Ms L lost the chance to decide whether  or not to drive home as a result  of that. I think had 
the agent diagnosed  a faulty  sensor, hed probably have said it was advisable not to drive  
the car on. It seems Ms Ls local garage told UKI the best option would still have been a 
home recovery. UKIs engineer thought the same. But its clear  from the text messages that 
Ms L wanted to get home that night. Had she known the car was driveable, she could have 
made an informed decision about  whether to continue her journey.  
Ms L says that paying £280 for the recovery created  financial difficulty  for her family.  So I 
think its reasonable to assume that costs  were an important issue  for her. Ms L would have 
had to weigh  the chance of a fault starting  in the next two hours  against  the certainty of a 
large recovery bill. I cant  be sure what Ms L would have done had she been given the right 
diagnosis. But I think some consumers  would have taken a risk in similar circumstances. 
Ms L might have chosen to risk driving  on in order to avoid the recovery charge.  As she 
faced financial loss by relying on the agents advice, I think  it would be fair and reasonable 
for UKI to refund half the recovery charge, plus interest.    
Ref: DRN27441373my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. I require U K Insurance  Limited to pay Ms L 
half the charge  she paid for the home  recovery service. It should add interest to that sum, at 
the simple yearly rate of 8%, from the date of the payment to the date of settlement. 
If UKI considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to withhold  income  tax from 
the interest,  it should tell Ms L how much  its taken off. It should  also give her a tax deduction  
certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax if appropriate. Under the rules  of 
the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms L to accept or reject my decision 
before 4 March  2019.
