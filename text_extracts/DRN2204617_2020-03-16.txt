K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly 
lent to him.
background
Mr W was given one flexi-credit and 23 instalment loans by Sunny between May 2014  and 
February 2016. A summary of his borrowing is as follows:
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  had been  wrong to give the flexi-credit  loan, loans 1 to 5 
and loans 15 to 23 to Mr W. But they didnt think Sunny should have agreed to lend from 
loan 6 to 14 as it was apparent from the pattern  of Mr Ws borrowing that he was reliant  on 
the short-term loans and was unlikely  to sustainably repay the amounts borrowed.  
Sunny disagreed and said the pattern indicated Mr W was borrowing as and when he 
needed funds.  But it offered to uphold Mr Ws complaint  about  loans 11 to 14. Mr W rejected 
Sunnys offer.  Loan Date Taken

Ref: DRN22046172As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it was passed to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and the customer  should be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ref: DRN22046173There were significant  breaks in Mr Ws borrowing from Sunny.  There was a gap of six 
months between the flexi-credit  loan and loan 1. And there was a further  gap of nearly  11 
months between loans 14 and 15. I think it would be reasonable for Sunny to view these 
gaps as an indication  that Mr Ws finances  had stabilised  after whatever the circumstances 
were that had caused him to take out the loans. So, I will look at Mr Ws borrowing in three  
separate lending chains.  
The first chain was made up of the flexi-credit loan only. The second  chain was made up of 
loans 1 to 14 and the third chain was loans 15 and 23. 
Having carefully considered all the arguments,  evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint, Im partly upholding the complaint. Ill 
explain why.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more before it lent Mr W the flexi-loan, loans 
1 to 5 and all of the loans  in the third chain of lending (loans 15 to 23). Mr W hasnt 
disagreed with the adjudicators findings.  I wont be making any further findings on these 
loans because they no longer appear to be in dispute. But Ive kept these loans in mind  
when thinking  about the overall borrowing relationship between Mr W and Sunny. 
As part of my review,  Ive looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending  history with Mr W, 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. In this chain of borrowing, Mr W had taken  out six loans within ten 
months. So Sunny ought to have realised  it was more likely  than not Mr W was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous loan was leaving in 
his finances and that Mr Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ws first instalment  loan was for £600 and loan 6 was for £750.  At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that it was unlikely Mr W was borrowing to meet  a 
temporary shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr W was provided with a new loan within days  of taking  out a 
previous one. 
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 14 was 
taken out a year and three months  after Mr Ws first. Mr W had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 to 14 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN22046174the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ws ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 14 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 6 to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 to 14 means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  these  should be removed from Mr Ws credit 
file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr W a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 April 2020.
