The complaint
Mr H complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) declined an application to 
port his existing mortgage and borrow more money. 
What happened
Mr H took a mortgage with NatWest in November 2019. This was arranged on the advice of 
a mortgage broker. Mr H took a two-year fixed rate mortgage product. If the mortgage was 
repaid within the first two years, an early repayment charge (ERC) would be applied.
In July 2020, Mr H applied to NatWest to port his existing mortgage and borrow further 
money as he and his family wanted to move to a new house as they needed more space. 
NatWest declined his application saying it was unaffordable. 
Mr H complained to NatWest and set out in detail why he felt the mortgage was affordable to 
him. NatWest didnt agree. Mr H went to another lender who agreed the higher mortgage 
amount. So, he repaid his NatWest mortgage and was charged an ERC.
Unhappy with NatWests response to his complaint, Mr H referred it to us where one of our 
investigators looked into it. She was satisfied NatWest was entitled to decline Mr Hs 
mortgage application, and she didnt think NatWest was required to refund the ERC.
Mr H didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to review his complaint. So, its been 
passed to me to consider and make a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H has submitted his complaint to NatWest and to us, and responded to our investigators 
opinion, in detail. I want to reassure him that Ive read and considered everything hes said. If 
I dont address certain points, its not because I havent thought about them. It simply reflects 
the informal nature of this service. Instead, Ill focus on the crux of Mr Hs complaint.
I also want to make it clear that I agree with our investigator that all of the complaint points 
Mr H has made are part and parcel of the same issue. That is, NatWest declining Mr Hs 
mortgage application, and then charging him an ERC when he moved his mortgage to 
another lender. Im going to focus on this in my decision.  
Mr Hs mortgage was portable. This means that he could apply to take it with him if he 
moved to a new house. However, any application to port the mortgage would be subject to 
NatWests lending criteria at the time of applying for the new mortgage, not on the previous 
underwriting criteria which applied when Mr H first took out the mortgage. This is standard 
across the mortgage industry, and is set out in the mortgage offer. 
When a customer submits an application for a mortgage, whether they are an existing 
borrower or not, a lender is nearly always required to conduct an affordability assessment. 
The exception to this is in certain circumstances where an existing customer isnt borrowing 
any more money. However, in this instance, Mr H was almost doubling the amount he was 
borrowing. Therefore, NatWest was required to conduct an affordability assessment. 
Once this assessment was completed, NatWest decided that Mr H didnt meet its lending 
criteria, and declined his application. Mr H has submitted many points which show that, in his 
opinion, he could afford it. 
Its not my role to decide whether I think Mr H couldve afforded the new mortgage. Its 
ultimately for a lender to decide who it wishes to lend to. And a lender generally has a free 
hand to set its lending criteria as well. 
NatWest assessed Mr Hs application taking into account a number of factors. It seems to 
me that the main reason that Mr Hs mortgage was deemed unaffordable was due to the fact 
that hes had support due to the coronavirus pandemic. Hed both taken a payment holiday 
under special Covid related rules introduced by the industry regulator. And hed said he 
applied for and received a self-employed government grant. Both of which suggested to 
NatWest that his income had been impacted by the pandemic. 
Mr H has since explained that his income wasnt impacted by the pandemic, and hes 
provided evidence to show this. Hes said he only took the grant because he was entitled to 
it. However, given that hed taken a grant designed to support those affected by the 
pandemic, and taken a payment holiday, I can understand why NatWest had concerns. 
At that time, we were very much still in the midst of the pandemic. As a responsible lender, 
NatWest has to make sure a mortgage is affordable both at the time its taken out, and in the 
future. And, for the reasons Ive explained, I understand why it had concerns with Mr Hs 
application. Thats not to say I think it was unaffordable  Im not making a finding either way 
regarding that. But NatWest is entitled to make the decision it did, for the reasons it did, and 
there was no obligation for it to agree to new borrowing. 
Mr H says that NatWest wasnt lending to anyone who was self-employed, and he doesnt 
think this is fair. But I disagree. Ive seen a copy of NatWests lending criteria from the time 
of Mr Hs application. NatWest was still lending to people who were self-employed, just not 
those who had received a self-employed grant or other types of assistance in regards to the 
pandemic. Again, this was set out in its lending criteria and is a decision its entitled to make.
Other factors would also have been considered when NatWest assessed Mr Hs application. 
Including Mr Hs income and credit history. And, as Ive previously noted, Mr H was almost 
doubling his existing borrowing. So, its entirely possible that, even without Mr H having 
taken the self-employed grant, he wouldnt have met NatWests lending criteria and wouldve 
still had his application rejected. 
Taking into account all of the above, Im satisfied NatWest fairly considered Mr Hs 
application. But he didnt meet its lending criteria, so it was entitled to decline his application. 
Moving on to the charging of the ERC. The mortgage offer provided to Mr H when he first 
took the mortgage clearly set out that an ERC would be payable if he repaid the mortgage in 
the first two years. I know Mr H wanted to keep his mortgage with NatWest, but wasnt able 
to if he wanted to move to a new house. However, Mr H made the decision to move to a new 
lender in the knowledge that an ERC would be charged. Im satisfied that NatWest was 
entitled to charge an ERC in this situation, and Im not going to ask for it to be refunded.   My final decision
I do recognise that Mr H feels very strongly about this matter, and will remain unhappy. But 
my final decision is I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 April 2022.
