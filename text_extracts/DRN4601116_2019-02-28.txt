Mrs C complains that Provident Personal Credit  Limited mis-sold her a number of home 
credit loans from 2009 to 2014. 
background
Mrs C took out 15 loans with Provident in 2009 and 2010. And a further two loans in 2014.  In 
2009 and 2010, the loans ranged  from around  £290 to £1,000 with weekly repayments 
ranging from around £9 to £32. And the two loans in 2014  were for £300 and £200 with 
weekly payments totalling  £17.50.
Mrs C fell into arrears  with the loans and payments  stopped  in August 2014. The remaining 
debt was sold to a third party in October  2015.
Mrs C says the loans  were taken out in her name by her ex-partner. She says her previous 
relationship was abusive, and therefore  she didnt feel in control  of her finances.
Mrs C complained to Provident that the loans  were unaffordable. She didnt  complaint  until 
December 2016  as this is when she became aware she could complain  about  affordability.  
Provident didnt  uphold Mrs Cs complaint.  They said she complained  too late about the 
loans taken out in 2009 and 2010  but they were  satisfied theyd lent responsibly  in 2014 
based on what Mrs C had declared about  her income. 
Mrs C brought her complaint to our service. Following an initial  jurisdiction view,  Provident 
consented to us looking into all loans on the complaint  but had limited information  to provide 
from the 2009 and 2010 loans due to the time which had passed. 
The adjudicator who looked at things  didnt think Provident had lent irresponsibly. In 
summary, he said, the individual loan payments from 2009  and 2010  were around £10 per 
week. And while Mrs C had a number of defaults on her credit file at the time of taking out 
the loans, this didnt mean  the loans  were unaffordable. He also said her bank statements 
showed considerable amounts going  in and out of her account  and discretionary spending. 
And he recognised  Mrs C had declared  her weekly income as around  £600 and outgoings of 
around £400 for the 2014 loans. So she had disposable income  especially for loan 
payments of £17.50.
Mrs C remained  unhappy. She said the money going in and out of her bank account wasnt  
always hers as she was self-employed. And she was made bankrupt in 2009 and had a 
number of defaults and repossessions at the time too. While Mrs C recognised  the individual 
weekly repayments were  relatively low, she said because she had multiple loans she was 
paying around £180 a week  back and had four children to support.
In January 2019, I issued a provisional decision.  In it, I said;
Mrs C has said due to the abusive relationship she was in, she was forced  to take out these 
loans from Provident.  While this must  have  been a really difficult time for Mrs C, I havent 
seen anything to suggest Provident were made aware of this when she applied for the loans. 
And as the loans  were taken out in her name, and repaid from her own bank account, I cant 
say Provident  should have reasonably been  aware  of this. So I cant  uphold  her complaint on 
this point alone.

The 15 loans in 2009 and 2010 were  as follows:
loan amount borrowed total interest

1 £500 £325 06/11/2009 £25

14 £500 £560 17/12/2010 £10
15 £500 £560 17/12/2010 £10
A number  of these loans  were paid off early.  However, as some  of these loans overlapped 
each other,  Ive considered the total amount Mrs C would  have had to pay back at any time 
and detailed this on the next table.

1 £25 06/11/2009

3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 
12, 13, 14 and 15£107.94 22/11/2010
This shows that in just over a year, Mrs Cs debt increased from £825 (£500  capital  plus 
£325 interest) with £10 weekly repayments to £8,997 (£4,499  capital plus £4,499  interest) 
with £107.94 weekly repayments.
Provident explained their process for loans  issued prior to July 2015. They said monthly 
refreshed and up to date Credit  Bureau  data was used to assess  existing  applications from 
January 2010.  And theyve explained  that when customers enquired  about  further  credit, it 
was the duty of the Provident agent  to review  repayments made to previous  agreements and 
ensure these did not indicate the customer was already experiencing difficulties meeting 
repayments prior to completing an application.
Due to the time which has passed since the loans were taken  out, I havent seen what Mrs C 
told Provident about her income and expenditure (I&E) in 2009  or 2010. Provident have 
explained the onus would  have been  on Mrs C to declare her other debt, however as I 
havent seen the I&E, Im not aware  what Mrs C said about her circumstances. Mrs C has 
provided us with her credit report from the time and her bank statements so Ive reviewed 
these while  considering the total weekly repayments. 
Ref: DRN46011163While Mrs Cs bank  statements  show  a relatively  high amount of incomings (although  most 
came from benefits) and outgoings, she has said the money wasnt always hers. While Ive 
no reason to doubt Mrs C, I dont  think its reasonable to say Provident should have been  
aware of that as its unlikely she disclosed this to them at the time due to the circumstances 
with her ex-partner.  
However, Mrs Cs credit  report shows some financial difficulties from the time she took out 
the loans with Provident in 2009 and 2010. The credit report  shows  a number of defaults and 
a number of arrears (six months and over)  for some  of her mortgage payments. While I 
appreciate Provident  shouldnt  base  their sole decision on the state of a customers  credit  
report, I do think the existing financial commitments alongside the continual  increase of debt 
with themselves is important to consider.
Provident have  said the agent  should review repayments made  to previous agreements.  
While Mrs C paid off four existing Provident  loans before taking out new ones, I think  when 
the total amount of debt is considered, this is an indication of potential financial  difficulty.  And 
Provident havent provided any evidence  to show that it properly assessed Mrs Cs 
circumstances with this in mind.
Based on what Ive seen,  Im satisfied the first two loans were affordable for Mrs C. I say that 
because they were both relatively small amounts with small repayments  which  she seemed 
to be able to keep up with. And I find it reasonable that Provident wouldnt have been 
alarmed at two separate  loan applications within five months  of each other.
However, Im not persuaded that the third and subsequent loans were affordable for Mrs C 
at the time they were  taken out. Thats because I havent seen any further  questions  were 
asked despite  Mrs C continuing to increase her debt. And I consider, based on the 
information I have  available, that Provident  shouldnt have approved  further loans to Mrs C.
Having said that, as Mrs C did benefit from having the money, I think it is fair she pays  it 
back. So while I agree  Mrs C should repay the capital loan amounts, I dont think  its fair for 
her to have  to pay the interest payments. I say that because, if Provident carried out 
sufficient and proportionate checks,  I think,  based  on the circumstances, its likely they 
wouldnt have decided  to lend.
So Im minded to ask Provident to repay Mrs C the total interest  charge paid over the 12 
loans. I will likely also require  them  to pay Mrs C interest on this amount at 8% per annum 
simple from the dates the loans were issued to the date they pay the amount due.
loans from 2014
The two loans in 2014 were as follows:
Loan amount borrowed total interest 
applieddate issued weekly repayments
16 £200 £164 28/02/2014 £7
17 £300 £246 28/02/2014 £10.50
This shows that the total weekly repayments  across both loans were £17.50. Provident have 
been able to provide me with the income  and expenditure  for both of these loans.
Ref: DRN46011164Mrs C declared  her weekly  income  was £600 and her outgoings were around  £400. 
Therefore, Mrs C declared she had a disposable  income of around £200.
At the time of taking  these  loans out, a further five existing Provident loans had been  settled  
in full. It appears, from the information Provident  have provided  that some  other  loans were  
written off in 2013. This is presumably because Mrs C was struggling to meet  the 
repayments of the other loans.
Provident say there  were  clear options  on the customer details form to record  accurate costs 
for income,  other income, mortgage/rent and other loan repayments.  And it seems  Mrs C 
declared her only other income was her mortgage.  However, since  making  her complaint 
she says she had a number of other debts at this time too.
While I appreciate it was Mrs Cs responsibility to give the correct information, I do think  
Provident, as a lender, also hold some responsibility to carry out proportionate checks when 
the information is inconsistent. I believe the information was inconsistent at this point, 
because Mrs C had six outstanding loans with Provident that theyd either written off or 
passed to a third party. Therefore, I find it reasonable  that they should have been aware 
Mrs C likely had more outgoings than just her mortgage which  she declared.
So based  on the information  Mrs C gave, I agree the loans were probably affordable. 
However, I dont think Provident  carried out enough  checks to satisfy  themselves the 
information she gave  was correct  and therefore enough to decide if the loans were 
affordable overall.
Therefore, I believe, like the loans from September 2010 onwards, the interest  and charges 
should be repaid to Mrs C. I will likely  also require  Provident to pay Mrs C interest on this 
amount at 8% per annum  simple from the dates the loans were issued to the date they pay 
the amount due.
overall
Overall, based on everything  Ive seen, Im minded to uphold this complaint in part as I dont 
think Provident carried out proportionate checks to satisfy themselves  of the affordability of 
the loans. I intend to require them to repay  Mrs C the interest and charges on all loans 
issued from September  2010 to February  2014. And they should  include interest  on these 
amounts.
Im aware some of the loans have  been sold to a third party.  I dont know  whether Mrs C has 
repaid anything further to the third party. It seems reasonable that if Mrs C still owes some  of 
the capital that she borrowed, that the refund due to her should  be used to repay that debt. 
But to do so, Provident will need to take the loan back  and reduce it to reflect  just the capital 
that Mrs C borrowed.  If Provident is unable or unwilling to do this, they must ensure the 
interest and charges, and any other  interest  and charges  added  by the third party, are 
waived.
So in summary,  I thought  Provident should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mrs C has paid on all loans from 
September 2010 to February 2014,
Ref: DRN46011165pay interest on those amounts at an annual rate of 8% simple  from the date of 
each loan to the date of settlement1,
if applicable, apply  the refund to reduce any capital outstanding  on the loans (with 
any credit  balance  being paid to Mrs C directly),
write-off any unpaid  interest and charges which are currently  outstanding.
Provident accepted the provisional decision.
Mrs C responded to my provisional decision.  She said the first two loans were  unaffordable 
and she doesnt  think she should have been given them. She said she was bankrupt at the 
time and bullied into taking the first two loans out.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments again to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought about what Mrs C has said regarding the first two loans. I havent seen anything 
to show Provident  were aware Mrs C was pressured  into taking out the loans due to her 
personal relationship.  And as explained  in my provisional decision, Im satisfied the first two 
loans were affordable  for Mrs C. Thats because they were  both relatively  small amounts 
with small repayments which she seemed to be able to keep up with. And I find it reasonable 
that Provident wouldnt have been alarmed at two separate  loan applications within five 
months of each other.
I note Mrs C thinks the Provident advisor  wouldnt  have been interested in her personal and 
financial circumstances  she thinks they just wanted to sell the loan. But I cant fairly say 
that is the case. I think its unlikely Mrs C declared  the financial abuse  she was suffering at 
the time of taking  out of the loans  and thats because she continued to take a number of 
loans. I dont doubt it was a really  difficult time for Mrs C  both financially and personally. 
But I need to be satisfied Provident would  have known  either  the loans were unaffordable  or 
Mrs C was pressured into taking them out. And based on what  Ive seen, Im not. 
Therefore, I consider  the first two loans (November  2009 and April 2010) were affordable 
and I wont be asking  Provident to repay the interest  on these loans.
However, I require Provident to repay  Mrs C the interest and charges on all loans issued  
from September 2010 to February 2014. And they should include interest  on these amounts.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against Provident Personal  Credit Limited.
Provident Personal Credit Limited  must:
refund  all interest and charges that Mrs C has paid on all loans from 
September 2010 to February 2014,
1 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Provident Personal Credit Limited  to take off tax from this interest. 
Provident must give Mrs C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.

each loan to the date of settlement2,
if applicable, apply  the refund to reduce any capital outstanding  on the loans (with 
any credit  balance  being paid to Mrs C directly),
write-off any unpaid  interest and charges which are currently  outstanding.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 March  2019.
