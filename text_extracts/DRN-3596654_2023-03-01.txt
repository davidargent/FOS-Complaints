The complaint
Mr T complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he paid for some holiday club membership 
points. Hes being represented in his complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr T and his wife entered into a purchase agreement in September 2014 to buy some 
holiday club membership points. The price of the points was Â£12,500 and their 
representative says that Mr T made the payment using a credit agreement with Barclays 
Partner Finance. The credit was settled in full in October 2014.
Mr Ts representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance under sections 75 and 140A 
of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in May 2020 that the membership was misrepresented to 
Mr T and his wife, the contract was breached, an undisclosed commission was paid by 
Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company, the credit wasnt affordable for Mr T and 
the relationship between him and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair. Barclays Partner 
Finance didnt issue a substantive response to that complaint so Mr T complained to this 
service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ts complaint should be upheld. He wasnt 
persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and he didnt think that the 
holiday company had breached the contract. He said that he hadnt seen enough to suggest 
that the relationship between Mr T and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and he wasnt 
persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He also 
said that he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable 
for Mr T.
Mr Ts representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ts complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Ts claims were made under sections 75 and 140A  section 75 gives a consumer 
an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of 
credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
(provided that certain criteria set out in that section are met) and section 140A gives 
a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid 
by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair 
relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ts claim under sections 75 and 140A as only 
a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner 
Finances response to his claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
Mr Ts representative has described the ways that it says that the membership was 
misrepresented to Mr T and his wife but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence in these circumstances to show that they were induced into entering into 
the purchase agreement by misrepresentations made by the holiday company;
it's my understanding that Mr T and his wife would be able to use the holiday club 
membership points on the terms agreed with the holiday company (including the 
payment of service charges);
Ive seen no reference in the purchase agreement and other documents from the 
time of sale to show that the points were an investment, would increase in value or 
that Mr T and his wife would be able to sell them at a considerable profit and Im not 
persuaded that Mr T and his representative have provided enough evidence to show 
that the holiday company told Mr T and his wife that the points were an investment, 
would increase in value or that they would be able to sell them at a considerable 
profit;
I dont consider that Mr T and his representative have provided enough evidence to 
show that Mr T and his wife were induced into entering into the purchase agreement 
to buy the membership points by misrepresentations made by the holiday company;
Mr Ts representative says that the holiday company has ceased to trade and has 
committed a repudiatory breach of contract  but its my understanding that the 
holiday company continues to trade and Ive seen no other evidence to support the 
claim that it has stopped trading;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract by the holiday company in these circumstances or that theres been any 
breach of laws or regulations for which Barclays Partner Finance would be liable;
Mr Ts representative says that commission was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to 
the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr T  but Ive not been provided with 
any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by Barclays Partner 
Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was normally 
paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays Partner 
Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr T risked 
the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr T used credit provided by Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the membership 
points but Ive not been provided with a copy of the agreement under which that 
credit was made available to him - but the evidence shows that the credit was repaid 
in October 2014 by two payments from Mr Ts bank account (and that, after the 
payments were made, the bank account remained in credit);
Mr Ts representative says that the finance agreement was unaffordable for Mr T  
but he was able to repay the credit within two months and Ive seen no evidence to 
show that the credit wasnt affordable for him at the time that it was made available to 
him;Ive also seen no evidence to show that he complained to Barclays Partner Finance 
about the affordability of the loan until the claim was made in May 2020  more than 
five years after the credit was made available to him  and I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him to have contacted Barclays Partner Finance if there were 
any issues with the affordability of the credit before then;
our investigator has provided evidence, including its licence number, to show that the 
credit intermediary was a regulated broker at the time of sale and Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that the credit intermediary acted as an 
unauthorised broker in arranging the credit for Mr T;
Mr Ts representative says that Mr T and his wife were forced to endure a half-day 
sales presentation but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
Mr T and his wife were unduly pressured into entering into the purchase agreement 
or that Mr T was unduly pressurised into taking out the credit or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Im not persuaded that Mr Ts representative has provided enough evidence to show 
that Mr Ts relationship with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider 
it to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship 
between Mr T and Barclays Partner Finance in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt issue a substantive response to Mr Ts claims so I 
cant say that its response was fair or reasonable  but if it had properly considered 
his claims I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it not to have 
upheld those claims; and
I sympathise with Mr T and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their 
membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays 
Partner Finance to refund to Mr T any of the credit that he used to pay for the 
membership points, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 March 2023.
