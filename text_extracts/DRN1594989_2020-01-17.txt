Mr M complains a telephone agent at NewDay Ltd (NewDay) incorrectly input his address 
details when he phoned them to make a debit card payment, resulting in these payments 
being declined,  and Mr M being  unable  to make further telephone payments to his Opus 
card account.
background 
Mr M has an Opus credit card, provided by NewDay.
He obtained this card in January 2018.  Each  month, he would pay his bill by phoning 
NewDay and making a debit card payment  over the phone.  This happened successfully 
every month until March 2019. He tried making  payments on 21, 23 and 25 March, but each 
time the payment failed due to an address verification error. Mr M complained and asked 
NewDay to find out why this happened and told NewDay he wouldnt make any more 
payments until hed been given a proper explanation.
NewDay initially said they couldnt find any problems with their payment system, although 
they did refund a £12.00  late fee as a gesture of goodwill. However, after looking at the 
complaint again,  NewDay  then upheld  the complaint, agreeing their associate had entered  
Mr Ms postcode incorrectly when inputting the payment details  although theyve since told 
us this wasnt the reason why the payments  he tried to make  in March  failed.  They refunded 
further charges  of £24.00  and credited  £30.00 to Mr Ms account as an apology.
However, because  Mr M hadnt made any further payments after February 2019 and arrears  
started to accrue, his card account  was suspended in April 2019 and a default  notice  and 
termination letter were  sent in May 2019.
Mr M is unhappy  for a number of reasons. He doesnt think  NewDay  has properly explained 
why his payments  failed.  He also thinks the compensation NewDay  paid him wasnt enough, 
as it doesnt reflect the amount of time he spent on the phone  and the inconvenience  
caused. He also thinks NewDay closed his account  too quickly.
One of our investigators  looked at Mr Ms complaint  but didnt  think  NewDay had done  
anything wrong. Unhappy with this, Mr M asked an ombudsman  to look at his complaint.
my provisional decision
In my provisional decision,  I said:
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I want to begin by looking at what 
happened when  Mr M tried to make  his monthly  payments in March  2019.
NewDay has provided us with system screenshots that show these payments failed because 
of something called an Address Verification System (AVS) failure.  NewDay  has told us that 
AVS is used  during a payment process  to verify a customers address. This is done  to make 
sure the billing address  of the card being  used matches the one the customer  tells them. If 
the address provided doesnt  exactly match the one that the bank has on file, the payment  
will fail. NewDay  say this is what happened  here.
Ref: DRN15949892The information shows six attempted payments between 21 and 25 March  2019 failed, all 
because of an AVS error - except  the third attempt  on 21 March 2019 that failed because the 
maximum number  of payment attempts  had been  made for that day.
NewDay has provided similar data from successful payments that were made earlier  in 2019 
 this shows the same address information  was input as on one of the failed attempts on 23 
March 2019. Whilst this still doesnt  tell me why the March 2019  payments failed  I still 
havent seen anything to confirm what caused the AVS to fail on these  payments   it does 
suggest the payments didnt fail because of a fault with NewDays  systems. Successful 
payments were made  earlier in 2019  with the same  details  being entered.
Ive asked Mr M to provide further information that would allow  me to see if this was an issue 
that only affected payments to NewDay, or whether other payments he tried to make at that 
time also failed. However, Mr M has said there isnt anything else he wishes  to provide, so I 
can only reach a decision  based on the information I already have. So, based  on the 
information available,  I havent seen anything  that suggests Mr Ms attempted  payments 
failed because of a fault with NewDays payment  systems.
However, I think NewDay could have done more  to engage with Mr M on this point. I can see 
they provided conflicting information to Mr M  first they told him the failed payments werent  
caused by a system  fault, then that they were the fault of an advisor entering an address 
incorrectly. NewDay subsequently told us the payment failures werent  caused  by their 
advisor incorrectly entering Mr Vs address. This must have been confusing.
I think NewDay could have done more to properly  investigate why these  payments failed, 
and communicate  this to Mr M. NewDay are able to access their systems and obtain  this 
information, whereas  Mr M clearly  cant. It was a reasonable  request that Mr M made  hes 
made this type of payment  successfully for over a year, so please explain to him why the 
payments failed that time. Hed spoken  to his bank, at NewDays suggestion, whod told him 
it wasnt a fault with their systems. I understand Mr M still doesnt know  what  really  caused 
these payments to fail. Whilst  I note NewDay have refunded a total of £36.00 in fees, I dont 
think the £30.00 compensation NewDay also paid to Mr M properly reflects the trouble and 
upset hes suffered as a result of the way NewDay communicated with him on this issue.
Before outlining the amount of compensation I think NewDay  should  pay, I want  to comment  
on what happened after the failed March payments. Mr M says hes made many phone  calls 
to NewDay trying to get an answer  to this question, with no real success. Because Mr M 
wasnt given a proper  explanation, he then stopped  making payments which  eventually  
resulted in a very serious consequence  his account was closed and eventually  defaulted,  
something that will sit on his credit file for six years.
However, it was Mr Ms decision to stop paying when he did. There  were  other  ways  to make 
his monthly payments - these are set out on his statements and on the arrears  and 
termination letters sent by NewDay. The importance  of bringing his account  up to date, and 
the consequences of not doing so, are also mentioned.
Mr M has been clear, both with NewDay and when speaking  to our investigator,  that he 
wouldnt make  any further payments using any other  method. This was a decision he chose 
to make.  Other payment methods existed that allowed Mr M to make his monthly  payments,  
and avoid his account being  defaulted.  He chose  not to use these.
So, whilst I think  NewDay were at fault for not properly investigating and communicating  why 
Mr Ms March  payments failed, I cant say NewDay were  wrong  to then chase the payment 
Ref: DRN15949893arrears that were accruing, or ultimately  default  and close the account. I dont think they 
acted unfairly by taking  the actions they did after Mr M stopped  making payments.
This is important when assessing what  I think  is the fair amount of compensation NewDay  
should pay to Mr M - I will only be considering  their failure to properly investigate, and 
communicate to Mr M, why his March  payments  failed. What  happened to Mr Ms account 
after this was down  to his refusal  to make other payment arrangements   this wasnt  
NewDays fault, and I wont  be asking them to do anything to reverse what theyve done.
So, for the above reasons, my provisional decision was to uphold this complaint.  I said I was 
minded to ask NewDay Ltd to pay compensation to Mr M for the trouble and upset  caused  
by their failure to fully investigate the reasons for the March  payment failures,  their failure  to 
communicate this to Mr M, and the conflicting  information they provided  to him. I think  
£150.00 fairly reflects the trouble and upset caused.
the response to my provisional  decision
Mr M has confirmed  he agrees with my above findings, and to the compensation payment 
Ive recommended. Newday has also been in contact, and confirmed it has nothing further to 
provide, and awaits my final decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And, following  the responses  received 
from Mr M and NewDay as mentioned  above, I have nothing further to add to the findings  set 
out in my earlier provisional  decision. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I uphold this complaint and require NewDay Ltd to pay 
£150.00 compensation to Mr M for the trouble and upset caused  by the way they dealt with 
his complaint, and their failure to properly investigate and communicate to Mr M the reasons 
for the March 2019 failed payments.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 February  2020.
