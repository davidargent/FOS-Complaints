K820x#14Complaint
Mr D complains that Barclays  Bank  UK PLC (trading as Barclaycard) closed his credit  card 
after it lost payments he made. 
Background
Mr D had a credit card with Barclaycard. In May, September and October 2018 the direct 
debit payments he made were returned to his bank account. Mr D made a payment of 
£1,000 on 3 May 2018 towards  the outstanding balance. On 31 August 2018 Mr D paid 
£162.30 to the credit  card. That was the last payment Barclaycard says it received from 
Mr D. 
On 1 October 2018 a direct debit payment was received by Barclaycard but was recalled to 
Mr Ds bank account the same day. Mr D spoke with Barclaycard  on 11 October  2018  and 
was advised to make the payment up. He discussed  the account  again via an online chat on 
14 October 2018 and was incorrectly  told that his October 2018 payment had been made. At 
that point, Mr Ds account was £332 in arrears. 
In November 2018 Barclaycard took the decision to reduce Mr Ds credit  limit from £10,000 
to £7,300. 
Mr D complained and Barclaycard  looked  at his online chat and listened to the calls hed 
made. Barclaycard  said that during a call on 11 October 2018  Mr D was told a minimum 
payment of £167  was required and that the 1 October 2018 payment had been returned. 
Barclaycard agreed  some  of the information Mr D had been given during his online chat was 
misleading and paid him £40 and waived a £12 fee. Barclaycard also said Mr D needed  to 
pay £479 by 5 December 2018  to bring his account  up to date. 
On 7 January  2019 Barclaycard withdrew Mr Ds spending facility.  No further payments had 
been received.  Mr D complained and Barclaycard and it responded on 24 January  2019. 
Barclaycard said its decision to stop any new spending on his card was in line with the 
account terms and due to the fact he hadnt  made  a payment  since 31 August 2018.  
Barclaycard said Mr Ds account would be £841.50  in arrears on 5 February 2019 when his 
next payment  was due. Barclaycard asked Mr D to contact its collections team  to discuss  
options for repaying the debt. 
Mr D referred  his complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. She thought 
Barclaycard had dealt  with Mr Ds complaint fairly and didnt ask it to do anything  else. Mr D 
didnt accept so his complaint has been  passed  to me to make a decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I agree  that Mr D was given some incorrect information about whether hed made a payment 
on 14 October 2018 when he discussed  his credit card online with Barclaycard. But 
Barclaycard had already said to Mr B that his 1 October 2018 payment had been returned  to 
his bank during  an earlier  phone call on 11 October  2018. So whilst  I agree that Barclaycard  
did make  an error, it also gave him the correct  information  when  he called. 
Ref: DRN01776792As a result of the ongoing arrears Barclaycard took the decision to reduce Mr Ds credit limit 
in November 2018. I understand Barclaycard provided some incorrect information. But no 
payments had been made to Mr Ds account since 31 August 2018  and I think  it was 
reasonable for Barclaycard to review the credit limit in the circumstances. The account  terms 
allow Barclaycard to take that step and Im not persuaded it acted  unfairly when the credit 
limit was reduced. 
After no further payments  were made Barclaycard  took the decision to suspend all new 
spending on the account. Again, thats a step the credit cards  terms allow  Barclaycard to 
take so I cant say its made a mistake. Im not persuaded that Barclaycards decision was 
unfair. The arrears on the account by this point  were significant and no payments had been 
made for several months. Whilst  I appreciate Barclaycard gave some incorrect information 
about Mr Ds direct debits in October 2018,  I still feel Barclaycards decision was fair. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr D but I havent been persuaded to uphold  his complaint. Im 
satisfied Barclaycards  decisions to reduce Mr Ds credit limit and then close his account was 
reasonable as no payment had been received since 31 August 2018.  Whilst I agree 
Barclaycard did make  an error, its paid Mr D £40 and refunded a £12 fee. I think  thats fair in 
all the circumstances.  As Barclaycard has dealt with Mr Ds complaint  fairly Im not telling it 
to take any further  action.  
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 February  2020.
