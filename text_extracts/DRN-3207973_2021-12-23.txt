The complaint
M complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly closed its business bank 
account, related loan and credit card. 
M says NatWests actions has caused it substantive inconvenience and its not been given 
any reason for the closure. 
What happened
In September 2020, following an internal review, NatWest closed Ms accounts. NatWest say 
it gave M seven days notice of this. M says it didnt get any such notice. 
M says if it was given enough notice of closure, it could have switched its accounts, 
transferred any balances and not had problems paying bills. M says its credit rating has 
been affected as a result. 
M complained to this service. One of our investigators looked into the matter, and they 
found: 
- NatWests review of Ms account, and subsequent block, was in line with its legal and 
regulatory obligations
- NatWest didnt apply its terms fairly by closing Ms account with seven days notice. 
Fair Notice would have been to give M 60 days notice
- There wasnt enough evidence to show NatWest had sent the notice to close letter
- NatWest didnt do anything wrong by not giving a reason for closing Ms accounts 
To put things right, and after further investigation, our investigator recommended NatWest 
pay £100 compensation for the inconvenience caused to M. NatWest also offered to pay 
£150 that was charged to Ms account in September 2020. 
M is happy to accept the £150 but finds £100 compensation paltry considering the 
inconvenience it has suffered. It argues its credit rating has been affected; it wasnt able to 
transfer its credit card balance elsewhere; nor get a loan with another bank to cover the one 
with NatWest. 
The matter has now been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
Account review
Banks in the UK are strictly regulated and must take certain actions in order to meet their 
legal and regulatory obligations. They are also required to carry out ongoing monitoring of an 
existing business relationship. That sometimes means banks need to restrict, or in some 
cases go as far as closing, customers accounts.
So, because of this, Im satisfied NatWest didnt do anything wrong when it reviewed, and 
blocked Ms accounts. 
Account closure
A bank is entitled to close an account just as a customer may close an account with a bank. 
But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which complies with the terms 
and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions of the account, which NatWest and M had to comply with, say it 
could close the account by giving it at least 60 days notice. And in certain circumstances it 
can close an account immediately or with less notice. 
Having looked at the information given to me by NatWest, Im not persuaded it was entitled 
to close the account in the way it has done. Im under no obligation that Im aware of to 
disclose the reasons NatWest took the actions it did. But given the information Ive seen, I 
think NatWest ought to have given M sixty days notice as opposed to the seven it says it 
gave.   
For NatWest to have closed the account in the way it has, I would expect to see stronger 
evidence than it has provided. 
M says it was caused substantive inconvenience and its credit rating has been affected. I 
havent seen any evidence from either party to show Ms credit worthiness has been 
adversely impacted. M argues that if it had been given more notice, than it could have 
avoided any detriment by switching the account, transferring the credit card balance and 
taking another loan to cover the one it had with NatWest. Im persuaded having sixty days to 
change its banking arrangements would have helped M.  
So I think M would have suffered less detriment had NatWest given it 60 days notice instead 
of the seven it says it did. 
M says it never received NatWests notice of closure letter. NatWest have given me a 
template of the letter it says was sent and a screenshot from its system to show it was. But I 
dont need to make a finding on whether the letter was sent as Ive already said NatWest 
should have given M 60 days notice. 
After our investigator sent their first view on this matter, NatWest said it would refund £150 
that was charged to Ms account in September 2020. Initially NatWest said this was a charge 
related to the account, and one that was charged the month before. M says it was for a 
recently taken out overdraft facility. 
The fact the bank statement says this relates to an overdraft satisfies me it was that, and not 
some regular business account activity related fee. 
So, I need to weigh up what I think is fair compensation for what NatWest have done wrong. 
Having done that, I think £250 compensation is fair. This takes into account the 
inconvenience caused to M, and the unfairness of having to pay a recently agreed fee for an 
overdraft facility. NatWest should also remove any adverse credit markers if it applied any against M in September, October and November 2020. This would mean, to a large extent, 
M isnt prejudiced by NatWest giving it seven days notice instead of sixty days. 
M may find my award too small, but Im looking at the impact to it as a business and not any 
distress caused to its directors. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part. I direct National Westminster Bank Plc to put things right as 
above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 January 2022.
