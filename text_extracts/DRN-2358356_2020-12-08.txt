The complaint
Mr S is unhappy with how a complaint was handled by PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA.     
What happened
On 1 June 2020, Mr S purchased an item online for just under £100 using his PayPal 
account. The item was never received, and Mr S contacted the merchant to resolve the 
issue. The merchant provided tracking information from a postal service showing that the 
item had been delivered to his address and wouldn't help further.
 
Mr S contacted PayPal on 27 June 2020 to raise a buyer dispute and provided details of the 
communication that he'd had with the merchant. PayPal contacted the merchant who sent 
them the same tracking information which showed that the item had been delivered.  
 
On 1 September 2020, PayPal declined Mr S's dispute on the basis of its user agreement, 
which states: "Your claim will not qualify for a refund under PayPal buyer protection if the 
seller has provided proof of delivery."  
Mr S raised a complaint with PayPal as he was unhappy with the outcome and the level of 
service that he'd received during the dispute, along with the time taken for the dispute to be 
resolved. PayPal did not uphold the complaint and said that they had acted in line with the 
terms of the user agreement.
Mr S was unhappy at this outcome and so brought the matter to our service. Our investigator 
felt that the tracking information which showed that the item had been delivered meant that 
PayPal were entitled to decline Mr S's dispute. However, our investigator also felt that the 
standard of service provided during the dispute, including the length of time taken to resolve 
it, was not to a fair standard, and that PayPal should make a payment of £50.00 to Mr S as 
compensation. Mr S was happy with this. But PayPal didnt agree that this was appropriate 
and requested that the matter be referred to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
 
PayPal noted that they had advised Mr S that they try to resolve disputes within 30 days but 
that some disputes do take longer - with Mr S's dispute being one of these. They also 
advised that there had been a backlog in disputes at that time. They argued that, as Mr S 
had decided to chase the matter himself, then he was effectively choosing to inconvenience 
himself, and that PayPal could not therefore be held responsible for the inconvenience that 
Mr S alleges to have suffered.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, it is my opinion that the award of £50.00 to Mr S for the poor standard of 
service received is fair and appropriate in this instance.
I note that Mr S was advised by PayPal that disputes can take longer than 30 days to 
resolve. That is, I think, reflective of PayPal trying to set customers expectations in a fair 
way. Not all disputes are the same and sometimes things will take longer to resolve in 
certain circumstances. But in the circumstances here, I think it wouldve helped Mr S if 
PayPal updated him in a more timely manner.
I say this because PayPal received the relevant tracking information on 17 July 2020. This 
information was clear and, given what PayPal has said about this, I think its fair to say that 
they shouldve known what their decision wouldve been on Mr Ss claim at this point. But it 
took more than six weeks, until 1 September 2020, for PayPal to formally confirm this with 
Mr S, despite Mr s chasing the matter after the initial 30 days had elapsed.
I realise that PayPal thinks that Mr S inconvenienced himself by chasing at this time, but I 
think its reasonable that he wanted to know what was happening when he hadnt been 
contacted within the usual timeframes that PayPal sets for a dispute.
I note that PayPal have stated that they were dealing with an influx of disputes at that time, 
and that this contributed to the delays. Im mindful of the circumstances that PayPal says 
they were dealing with at this point. But given the circumstances here, I don't think that this 
validates PayPal not providing Mr S with timely updates as to the progress of his dispute for 
such a period of time.
 
So, considering all of the above, it is my decision that the award of £50.00 to Mr S for the 
level of service which he received from PayPal is fair and reasonable in this instance.
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA should pay Mr S £50.00 for the 
reasons explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2021.
