The complaint
Mr P complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money provided him with 
loans he was unable to afford to repay.
What happened
118 118 Money provided Mr P with the following loans:
Loan 
ref:Date taken Amount Term 
monthsMonthly 
paymentAmount 
repayableDate 
repaid
Loan 1 2207392 12/01/2019 £2,000 24 £129.16 £3,099.84 14/09/2019
Loan 2 2463832 14/09/2019 £1,100 24 £169.69 £4,072.56 11/01/2020
Loan 3 2578328 21/02/2020 £1,500 12 £172.12 £2,065.44 19/06/2020
Mr P says that when he took the first loan out, he wanted to consolidate his credit payments. 
But he found he was getting into increasing debt and had to take out further loans. He also 
got into difficulties with gambling. 118 118 Money said it had properly assessed the 
affordability of each loan.
On referral to this service our adjudicator said that that for loan 1, 118 118 Money had 
carried out reasonable and proportionate checks and had made a fair lending decision. For 
loans 2 and 3, she said that the information revealed by its checks should have alerted 118 
118 Money to the need for further information from Mr P about his finances. 
However she noted that Mr Ps representatives had sent in bank statements for one account 
around the time each loan was taken out. However she noted that the account didnt show 
any payments reflecting the majority of Mr Ps living expenses, nor of his credit 
commitments. So she said that she couldnt say what information would have been revealed 
had 118 118 Money carried out further checks. So she couldnt uphold the complaint.
Mr P didnt agree with the adjudicators view and asked for an ombudsmans decision. He 
didnt provide any further information/evidence. The matter has been passed to me for 
further consideration. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
118 118 Money carried out detailed credit checks for loans 1 and 3. It also independently 
verified Mr Ps income.
loan 1
The credit check showed that Mr P had a current account that was £245 overdrawn, the 
overdrawing all occurring in the previous month to the loan being taken out. He had three 
credit cards all with balances on them, but he was making payments towards them and they 
werent in default. He had an HP loan which he was paying at the rate of £128. Overall I 
think the credit check, taking into account his income showed that Mr P should have been 
able to afford the loan. I bear in mind that he intended to pay off his credit. So I dont think 
that 118 118 Money needed to do any more checks and that it made a fair lending decision.
loans 2 and 3
I havent seen that 118 118 Money carried out a credit check in respect of loan 2. The check 
for loan 3 showed that Mr Ps financial position had considerably worsened. He had two 
current accounts, both of which were overdrawn. He now had four credit cards, one with a 
balance of £3,692, another with £1,127, and the other two with respective balances of £627 
and £835. They were all below their limits and Mr P was making regular payments towards 
them. Mr P still had the HP loan from the previous credit check, but now had an additional 
loan with a balance of £6,600.
I dont think that 118 118 Money carried out a proportionate check in respect of loan 2. For 
loan 3 I think the checks should have sufficiently alerted it to carry out further checks, 
especially bearing in mind that Mr Ps debts had considerably increased since loan 1 but his 
income hadnt apparently increased accordingly.
But I cant say what any such further checks would have revealed. Mr P has provided bank 
statements for one current account for the month after loan 1 started, the month after loan 2 
and the months before and after being provided with loan 3. Those accounts dont show any 
normal living expenses, e.g. utilities or rent. And its clear that the loan monies werent paid 
into that account, so I havent seen evidence of Mr Ps credit payments at the time any of the 
loans were issued. Im aware that Mr P has another account, as it shows up on his credit 
records and there are some transfers from one account to this other account which show on 
his bank statements. 
Unfortunately, without further evidence I cant say what any further checks by 118 118 
Money would have shown. So I cant say that 118 118 Money made an unfair lending 
decision in respect of loans 2 and 3.
My final decision
I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 March 2022.
