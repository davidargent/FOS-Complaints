The complaint
Mr L is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA restricted his account and sent him 
an email advising that it would be closed permanently because of risks PayPal had identified 
with the account.  
What happened
Mr L received an email from PayPal advising that his account was to be closed permanently. 
When Mr L contacted PayPal about this, the only information PayPal would provide was that 
they considered that there were risks associated with Mr Ls account that had led them to 
take the decision to close it. Mr L wasnt happy about this, or that he had approximately £200 
in the account which PayPal wouldnt allow him to access, so he raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mr Ls complaint. They referenced their User Agreement, to which Mr L 
had agreed when opening the account, and which stipulates that PayPal maintain the right to 
limit or terminate an account if they feel that the account poses unacceptable risks to them. 
PayPal confirmed that they had limited Mr Ls account for such reasons, and so they didnt 
uphold Mr Ls complaint.
Mr L wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They noted that PayPals further 
investigations had led them to conclude that Mr Ls account didnt in fact pose any risks to 
them and that Mr Ls account had been reinstated and made available for use by Mr L. 
Our investigator felt that Mr L had incurred unnecessary distress because of PayPals 
actions in restricting his account and the wording of PayPals communication to Mr L, and so 
they recommended that this complaint be upheld and that PayPal should make a payment of 
£50 to Mr L to compensate him for what had taken place.
PayPal didnt agree with the recommendation put forwards by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear that PayPals User Agreement includes that PayPal maintain the right to suspend or 
terminate an account if PayPal believe that the account poses unacceptable risks to PayPal. 
And its evident that PayPal took the steps they did, including sending Mr L emails informing 
him that his account was to be closed permanently, because of their implementation of this 
section of their User Agreement.
However, it can be considered that an unfair outcome to a customer has occured as the 
result of an application of terms and conditions, and its within the remit of this service to 
instruct the payment of compensation to a customer should that be the case.
In this instance, it appears that PayPal restricted Mr Ls account and sent communications to 
him about this before conducting a reasonable investigation into Mr Ls usage of his account. 
And its evident that when PayPal did conduct such an investigation they concluded that 
there was nothing in Mr Ls usage of his account that posed an unacceptable risk to them, 
which then led them to remove the restrictions on Mr Ls account and make the account 
available for Mr L to use once again.
But its difficult not to conclude that PayPal should have conducted this investigation  which 
it appears merely consisted of reviewing how Mr L used his account  before limiting the 
account and before sending Mr L communication declaring that his account would be closed 
permanently  which I accept caused Mr L unnecessary alarm.
Because of this, while I accept that PayPal acted within the terms of the User Agreement, 
Im satisfied that by implementing those terms in the manner that they did, PayPal have 
caused Mr L unnecessary distress and that therefore an unfair outcome to Mr L did occur. 
It follows from this that my final decision here will be that I am upholding this complaint in   
Mr Ls favour on that basis and that PayPal must make a payment of £50 to Mr L to 
compensate him for the distress and inconvenience this matter may have caused.
Mr L has also stated, in recent correspondence with this service, that PayPal have closed his 
account which he believes was a mistake. However, my review of this complaint is limited to 
the matter originally complained about by Mr L, and as such I encourage Mr L to discuss this 
new matter with PayPal directly.   
Putting things right
PayPal must make a payment of £50 to Mr L.  
My final decision
I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA on the basis explained 
above.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 Febrruary 2022.
