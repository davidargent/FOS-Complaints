K820x#14Complaint
Ms B complains  that Capital One (Europe) plc made mistakes  after she accidentally made 
an additional  payment in December 2018. 
Background
In December 2018 Ms Bs outstanding credit card balance was £486.72 and on 
19 December 2018 a direct debit payment of £5 was collected. Ms B made a payment of 
£481.72 to clear the outstanding balance on 20 December 2018 but has told us there was a 
problem. As a result, an additional  payment of £481.72  was applied to the credit  card on 
21 December 2018. 
On 26 December 2018 Capital One sent Ms B a credit card statement that showed the 
balance was in credit by £322.36. The statement said Ms B didnt need to make  a minimum 
payment in January 2019. On 27 December 2018 Capital One debited  £481.72 from Ms Bs 
credit card and sent it to her as a Faster Payment. 
Capital One sent the next statement on 26 January 2019. It said the outstanding  balance 
was £418.59.  Ms B made  a direct debit payment of £5 on 8 February 2019 and a debit card 
payment of £413.59  on 20 February 2019. 
On 29 March 2019 Ms B complained that Capital One had incorrectly added £481.72 to her 
credit card and asked for a refund, an apology and £1,000.  Capital One responded on 
16 April 2019 but didnt agree an error  had been  made. Ms B referred her complaint to our 
service and it was passed to an investigator. The investigator didnt find that Capital One had 
made a mistake in regards to the £481.72  payments Ms B made  and didnt uphold  the 
complaint. Ms B asked to appeal so her case has been passed to me to make a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see Ms B has genuine  concerns that shes been overcharged. Ive looked at her 
complaint letters,  statement  notes as well as the calculations  shes  sent in. Ive also 
reviewed the statements  Capital One has provided and have independently reviewed  the 
credit card movements in December 2018, January 2019 and February 2019 to see whether 
any errors have been made. I know my decision will disappoint  Ms B but the evidence Ive 
seen doesnt show an error in the way Capital One has administered the account or that 
shes overpaid. 
Ms B made three payments in December  2018. One of £5 and two of £481.72. The result of 
the additional payment was that the credit card was placed in a credit  position. 
Capital Ones statement dated  26 December 2018  shows Ms Bs balance as -£322.36. But 
that figure doesnt  represent a negative  or outstanding credit card balance, or debt. Because 
of the way credit cards  work the statement shows that Ms Bs account  was in credit  by 
£322.36. To put it another way, the 26 December 2018 statements shows  that (as a result of 
receiving two payments  of £481.72)  Capital  One owed Ms B £322.36. I note that because  
the credit  card was in credit,  Capital One advised  no monthly payment was needed in 
January 2019.
Ref: DRN52383372On 27 December 2018 Capital One sent a faster payment  to Ms M for £481.72  which 
refunded the additional  payment  it received  earlier in the month. The refund had the effect of 
putting Ms Bs account back into debt. But thats  correct as the credit balance  was 
accidentally caused  by the additional  payment Ms B made in December 2018. 
Ive been through Ms Bs statement dated  26 January 2019. At the date of issue Ms Bs 
account was £322.36 in credit. After  Capital One refunded her payment of £481.72  the 
outstanding balance was £159.36.  Over  the course  of the month, Ms B completed 
transactions totalling £314.62. There were two credits to the account during the period 
totalling £55.39. Ive checked the statements and figures used by Capital One. Im satisfied 
that the outstanding balance of £481.59, as set out in the statement dated 26 January 2019, 
was correct. 
There are three account notations for the £481.72 payment. A credit  on 
20 December 2018 and another on 21 December 2018. Both are noted in the Paid in 
column. The final notation is from 27 December 2018 and shows one payment of £481.72 in 
the Paid out column. The statements show Ms B made two payments of £481.72 and one 
of them  was refunded. The statements dont show that Ms B has been overcharged. Im 
satisfied the evidence shows the additional £481.72 payment made was correctly refunded, 
in line with what Capital  One has told Ms B. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Ms B as I can see how strongly she feels. But I havent found 
any errors by Capital One so Im not telling it to issue  a refund or compensate Ms B. Ive 
reviewed all the statements both Ms B and Capital One have sent in along with the 
accompanying information.  But I havent found  any errors by Capital One so Im not 
upholding Ms Bs complaint. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 March  2020.
