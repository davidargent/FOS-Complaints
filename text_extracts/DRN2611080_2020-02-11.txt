K821x#15Mr M complains that MYJAR Limited (Myjar) acted irresponsibly when it gave him 
unaffordable loans.
background
This complaint is about eleven loans  Myjar provided to Mr M between April 2015  and 
February 2017. 
Heres a table setting out details of those loans:

All the loans  have been repaid. 
Mr M said Myjar didn't do proper checks before lending to him and he became  desperate 
and depressed not knowing  how hed be able to pay his loans and bills along  with his living 
costs. Mr M told us he sometimes  went without just so that he could avoid incurring more 
debt and hes still struggling to try and improve his credit rating.
Our adjudicator upheld  the complaint in part. She felt she hadnt seen enough  to say that 
loans 1 - 5 were  unfair but she felt that Myjar shouldnt have approved loans 6 - 11.  
Mr M hasnt  said whether he agrees with the adjudicators view or not. 
Myjar disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It mainly says (in summary) that the checks it 
did were proportionate. And Myjar says it isnt clear that our adjudicator  has considered all 
the information it sent us and the view lacks detail  and reasons.  
The complaint came to me to decide. I issued a provisional decision. 
what I said in my provisional decision
Here are some of the main things I said. 
Ref: DRN26110802Myjar needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Myjar should fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Myjar was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Loans 1  3
Myjar told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr M. It asked him for details of his 
income and normal  expenditure  as well as enquiring about what he was spending  on other 
credit commitments.  And Myjar carried out checks on Mr Ms credit  file.
I dont think Myjar was wrong to give the first three loans to Mr M. I think its fair to say that 
all these loans looked comfortably affordable for Mr M based  on the information Myjar had 
collected about his financial circumstances. And, at that early stage of his borrowing 
relationship with the lender, I dont  think Myjar had any reason to think  that it needed to 
make more detailed  checks into his financial situation. So Im not planning to uphold  Mr Ms 
complaint about  loans  1-3.
Ref: DRN26110803Loan 4
By loan 4, Mr M was borrowing five times  the amount hed first asked Myjar for when he took 
out loan 1 just five months or so earlier. I think this should have prompted Myjar to look 
further into Mr Ms circumstances  when he took out loan 4  and specifically Myjar shouldve 
asked more searching questions about Mr Ms spending on other short  term loans. However, 
had it done so, looking at the information Mr M has provided, including  his bank statements, 
I havent seen  enough to show that Myjar shouldve decided not to agree  these  loans. For 
this reason, Im not planning to uphold Mr Ms complaint about loan 4.
Loan 5
By now, Mr M had been borrowing from Myjar for around 6 months, usually with no more 
than a few weeks  off in between  loans.  So I think Myjar ought to have gone further in its 
affordability checks and looked in a bit more detail at Mr Ms spending when he applied  for 
this loan to make sure it properly understood his financial  situation before agreeing to lend 
him more  money.  If Myjar had done  this, it would've likely seen Mr M was already paying for 
other high cost borrowing elsewhere  when he applied to Myjar for loan 5. But it had allowed 
for this already  in its own lending assessment. And I think the combined repayments that 
Mr M agreed  to make on all his outstanding loans still looked  affordable  compared  to the 
income that Myjar had worked out he had available to spend on paying for borrowing. So 
overall, I dont think Ive seen enough to say that Myjar  was wrong to lend loan 5 to Mr M  
and Im not planning  to uphold Mr Ms complaint about this loan. 
Loans 6 - 10
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Myjars lending history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Myjar should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Myjar  shouldve realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I think by loan 6 Myjar should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was likely to be unsustainable and it shouldnt  have provided 
this loan  or any further loans, up to and including loan 10. 
I say this because:
by now, Myjar could  see that Mr M had already been borrowing for around 8 months  
without any significant gaps  in lending
the amounts  he was borrowing had gone up and down  but I think its significant that 
whilst loan 5 looked like it could  mean  that Mr M might be starting to take out smaller 
loans, in the event, loan 6 was for the same amount as hed just paid for loan 5
so I think it looked  more likely that Mr M had to borrow  further  to cover the hole 
repaying each  previous loan was leaving in his finances
and that hed become dependent on this sort of high cost credit  so Myjar ought to 
have realised that Mr Ms repeated borrowing was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN26110804Ive carefully considered  everything Myjar has said, including its response  to our 
adjudicators view. But for the reasons Ive explained, I dont think it was reasonable for 
Myjar to think that it was likely Mr M would be able to repay loan 6, or any further loans, in a 
sustainable way.
I think that Mr M lost out when Myjar provided loan 6 because:
this loan had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time.  
by now, the number of loans Mr M had borrowed was likely to have negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for high-cost  loans.  
So Im proposing to uphold  the complaint about loans 6 -10. 
Loan 11
Unlike our adjudicator, I dont feel Ive seen enough information to be able to say that its fair 
for me to uphold  Mr Ms complaint about loan 11.
Mr M didnt  ask Myjar for any more loans  during  the period end-April  2016   mid- February 
2017. That gap in lending seems long enough  to me for Myjar reasonably to think that Mr M 
mightve put his finances in order during this period. This meant  that when his borrowing 
started again, and Mr M applied for loan 11, he was effectively starting over. So it was fair for 
Myjar to treat this as a new chain of borrowing and assess his lending requests accordingly.
I've also taken into account  that when Mr M returned to Myjar to ask for loan 11, he 
borrowed half the amount of the last loan hed taken out with Myjar.
Given the amounts  that Mr M needed  to repay  wouldve  seemed relatively affordable 
compared with the take home  pay hed declared,  and what  was apparent about his 
circumstances, I dont  think  it wouldve been  proportionate for Myjar to ask Mr M for the 
amount of information  that would be needed  to show the lending  was unsustainable before 
agreeing this loan.  So Im not planning on upholding  Mr Ms complaint about loan 11.
what the parties said in response to my provisional  decision 
I havent heard anything  further from Mr M.
Myjar has confirmed it agrees to settle  the complaint the way Ive set out in my provisional 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
As no further  comments have been received from Mr M by the deadline date and Myjar has 
confirmed it accepts what I've said, I think its fair to uphold this complaint for the reasons 
I explained in my provisional decision.  
Ref: DRN26110805putting things right  what the lender should  do
A.Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, not including  anything it has already refunded.
B.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr M which  were  
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr M originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C.Pay Mr M the amounts calculated  in "A" and "B".
A.The number of loans taken from the point of loan 6 up to loan 10 means any 
information recorded about these  loans is adverse.  So all entries about loans 6  10 
inclusive should  be removed from Mr Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Myjar to take off tax from this interest. Myjar must 
give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  and direct MYJAR  Limited (Myjar) to pay Mr M as set out above.
 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 March  2020.
