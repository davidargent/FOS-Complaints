Complaint
Ms M has complained that Loans 2 Go Limited (L2G) provided her with unaffordable loans.
Background
L2G initially provided Ms M with a loan for £1,000 in December 2022. This loan had an APR 
of 770.0% and an 18-month term. This all meant the total amount repayable of £3,700.08, 
was due to be repaid in 18 instalments of £205.56. Ms M repaid this loan early and in full in  
January 2023.
In February 2023, L2G provided Ms M with a second loan for £700. This loan had an APR of 
770.0% and an 18-month term. This all meant the total amount repayable of £2,590.02, was 
due to be repaid in 18 instalments of £143.89. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint and thought that L2G unfairly provided 
these loans as proportionate checks would have shown they were unaffordable. 
L2G disagreed with our investigator and asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending -
including the key rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. And Ive
referred to this when deciding Ms Ms complaint.
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Ms Ms complaint. These two
questions are:
1. Did L2G complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself
that Ms M would be able to repay her loans in a sustainable way?
o If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
o If not, would those checks have shown that Ms M wouldve been able to do 
so?
2. Did L2G act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Did L2G complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Ms M would be 
able to repay her loans in a sustainable way?
L2G provided these loans while it was authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). The rules and regulations in place required L2G to carry out a reasonable 
and proportionate assessment of Ms Ms ability to make the repayments under these 
agreements. This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or 
affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower focused  so L2G had to think about whether
repaying the loan would cause significant adverse consequences for Ms M. In practice this
meant that L2G had to ensure that making the payments to the loan wouldnt
cause Ms M undue difficulty or adverse consequences.
In other words, it wasnt enough for L2G to simply think about the likelihood of it getting its 
money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Ms M. Checks also had 
to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount / type / cost of credit they are seeking.
Even for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different
applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the longer the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit is
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make payments for an extended 
period); and
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed a proportionate check
shouldve been for a given loan application  including (but not limited to) any indications of
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in future circumstances.
Ive carefully thought about all of the relevant factors in this case.
Were L2Gs checks reasonable and proportionate?
L2G says that it carried out an income and expenditure assessment with Ms M prior to 
providing her with these loans. It also carried out credit checks. Ms M declared that she was 
earning around £1,400.00 a month for loan 1 and £1,470.00 a month at the time of loan 2. 
L2G checks suggested her income was broadly accurate and it calculated her expenditure to 
be around £1,050.00 (loan 1) and £1,120.00 (loan 2) based what it saw on her credit file. In 
L2Gs view, this left Ms M with enough to cover the payments to these loans. 
Ive carefully considered what L2G has said. But L2Gs credit checks clearly show Ms M had 
a history of arrangements to pay and payday loans. Equally, when Ms M approached for loan 2 an account was over the limit and L2G saw that Ms Ms expenditure had increased. 
So while Ms M may not have had any accounts in default or had any County Court 
Judgments taking out against her, I think it would be incorrect to conclude this meant that 
she was in a great financial position, or that this in itself meant that she could repay these 
loans without difficulty or borrowing further.
Furthermore, L2Gs own checks showed that these repayments indicated that the payments 
to these loans would be taking up the vast majority of what it estimated Ms Ms disposable 
income to be. Bearing all of this in mind, I think that L2G needed to take steps to verify          
Ms Ms actual monthly expenditure. Particularly as the estimate is unlikely to have captured 
all of Ms Ms expenditure.
As I cant see that this L2G did do this, I dont think that the checks it carried out before 
providing Ms M with her loans were reasonable and proportionate.
Would reasonable and proportionate checks have indicated to L2G that Ms M
would have been unable to repay these loans?
As reasonable and proportionate checks werent carried out before these loans were 
provided, I cant say for sure what they wouldve shown. So I need to decide whether it is 
more likely than not that a proportionate check would have told L2G that Ms M would have 
been unable to sustainably repay this loan.
L2G was required to establish whether Ms M could make her loan repayments without 
experiencing significant adverse consequences  not just whether the loan payments were 
technically affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Ive carefully considered the information provided. Having done so, Im satisfied that it is 
more likely that not that Ms M was borrowing further to repay previous loans, or at the very 
least borrowing to fill the hole that repaying previous loans was leaving in her finances. 
Ms Ms income wasnt high and she was struggling. I think that proportionate checks would 
have shown L2G that she was likely borrowing these loans to use them in the same way as 
previous borrowing, which meant she was unlikely to be able to repay them without 
borrowing further or suffering significant adverse consequences.
Bearing all of this in mind, Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would
more likely than not have demonstrated that Ms M would not have been able to make the
repayments to these loans without borrowing further and/or suffering undue difficulty. And, in 
these circumstances, I find that reasonable and proportionate checks would more likely than 
not have alerted L2G to the fact that Ms M was in no sort of position to make the payments 
on these loans without suffering significant adverse consequences.
Did L2G act unfairly or unreasonably towards Ms M in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about everything provided. And having done so, Ive not seen anything 
to suggest that L2G acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Ms M in some other way. So I 
dont think L2G acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Ms M in some other way.
Did Ms M lose out as a result of L2G unfairly providing her with these loans?
As Ms M paid and is being expected to pay a high amount of interest and charges on loans 
that she shouldnt have been provided with, Im satisfied that she has lost out as a result of 
what L2G did wrong.So I think that L2G needs to put things right.
Fair compensation  what L2G needs to do to put things right for Ms M
Having thought about everything, I think it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Ms Ms complaint for L2G to put things right by:
refunding all interest, fees and charges Ms M paid on loan 1;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Ms M to the date of settlement;
removing all interest, fees and charges applied to loan 2 from the outset. The 
payments Ms M made, whether to L2G or any third-party debt purchaser, should be 
deducted from the new starting balance  the £700 originally lent. If Ms M has 
already paid more than £700 on this loan then L2G should treat any extra as 
overpayments. And any overpayments should be refunded to Ms M. If an outstanding 
balance remains after all adjustments have been made, L2G can use any 
compensation due from loan 1 to reduce and/or clear the balance on loan 2.
removing all adverse information it recorded on Ms Ms credit file as a result of loan 
1. Any adverse information recorded as a result of loan 2 only needs to be removed 
should no outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires L2G to take off tax from this interest. L2G must give     
Ms M a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Ms Ms complaint. Loans 2 Go Limited needs 
to put things right in the way set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2024.
