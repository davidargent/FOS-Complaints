The complaint
Mr B complains that  PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) debited his account with a 
return and advised the buyer to return the item to the wrong address.
What happened
 Mr B sold a laptop through an online website in July 2020. He received payment of £655.11 
via PayPal. The buyer said the laptop was damaged and asked PayPal for a return. PayPal 
agreed. The buyer returned the laptop and Mr B was debited by PayPal for £655.11. Mr B 
appealed PayPals decision but they upheld their original view.
Mr B complained. He said that the buyer opened, and then closed, a returns case with the 
online website. On the advert on the website hed said there were slight problems with two of 
the keys, but the buyer then claimed the keyboard was completely damaged. Mr B said the 
buyer must have caused the damage, possibly by attempting his own repair  which he 
didnt agree to. So, he said the buyer should stand some of the cost of the laptop. And when 
PayPal agreed that the laptop could be returned to him, they advised the buyer to send it to 
the wrong address. So, he had to travel more than 100 miles to collect it.
PayPal said their user agreement entitled them to debit Mr Bs PayPal account with the cost 
of the laptop. Once theyd received the tracking information which showed the item was 
returned (on 20 October 2020), they refunded the buyer and debited Mr Bs account. Theyd 
reviewed Mr Bs appeal and decided in favour of the buyer. The laptop was returned to the 
address held for Mr B on PayPals system. 
Mr B brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator looked at what had happened. 
He said that PayPal had acted within its Buyer User Agreement. This said that where the 
buyer claims the item wasnt what was ordered  then the buyer could claim a refund. And in 
this case, the buyer had claimed the keyboard was completely damaged and so wasnt 
what was advertised. He could see that there were several addresses held for Mr B on 
PayPals system. One was described as home, but PayPal had advised the buyer to send 
the laptop to another address, which was a round trip of over 100 miles. He said PayPal 
should pay Mr B £75 for the inconvenience this caused.
Mr B asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 I can see where Mr B is coming from. He says he was upfront about the fact there were a 
small number of keys on the laptop which werent perfect. But when the buyer contacted 
PayPal to ask for a return, he said the keyboard was completely damaged. So, in Mr Bs 
view, the buyer had caused the damage. On top of this, the laptop  when it was returned  
was sent to an address which caused him to have to travel over 100 miles to get it back.
My role here is to see if PayPal acted fairly and within its terms and conditions. In this case, I 
think they did  I will explain why. Their User Agreement outlines the rights of buyers and 
sellers. It says that sellers should read its Buyer Protection Policy  and if they lose a claim 
under it:
 
You must forfeit the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost.
If the claim was that the item received was Significantly Not as Described, you may 
not receive the item back, or you may be required to accept the item back plus pay 
for return shipping costs. 
If the balance in your cash account or business PayPal account is insufficient to cover the 
amount, we may. Create a negative balance in your PayPal account ..
PayPals Buyer Protection says When you buy something from a seller who accepts 
PayPal, you may be eligible for a refund under PayPal Buyer Protection. When applicable, 
PayPal Buyer Protection entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item 
plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any. PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, 
whether your claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection. PayPal Buyer Protection may 
apply when you encounter these specific problems with a transaction:
You didn't receive your item from a seller (referred to as an Item Not Received 
claim), or
You received an item, but the item isn't what you ordered (referred to as a 
Significantly Not as Described claim) 
An item may be considered Significantly Not as Described if:The item is materially 
different from the seller's description of it.
So  in summary, if a buyer claims the item wasnt as described, they can ask for a refund. 
And any decision by PayPal on claims is final. And PayPal have the right to debit a 
customers account with the cost, even if that causes an overdrawn position. Because the 
buyer said the items wasnt as described  he said, the computer has completely damaged 
keyboard, then he claimed his rights under the Buyer Protection. 
Mr B said that the buyer must have damaged the laptop himself  but PayPal reviewed what 
Mr B said when he made his appeal  and stayed with their original decision  as was their 
right.
So  PayPal operated within their User Agreement  and I cant therefore decide which says 
they acted unfairly or unreasonably. 
Looking at the return of the laptop to the wrong address. I can see that Mr B had seven 
different addresses logged with PayPal. He says that they shouldve realised which address 
to return the laptop to  the one where it was sent from. I dont think that was PayPals job  
but one of the addresses was marked home, so it was fair to expect them to select that 
one. But one of the others was chosen  and I agree with our investigator that it wouldve 
been reasonable for PayPal to choose the home address. And so, a payment to Mr B of 
£75 for the inconvenience of having to travel to pick up the laptop is appropriate.
Mr B is looking to receive a higher sum of money to reflect that he says the laptop was 
damaged by the buyer. So, he will be disappointed by my decision, which is that PayPal 
must pay compensation of £75 for the inconvenience suffered by Mr B in having to travel to 
pick up the laptop.
 
Putting things right PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must pay compensation of £75 to Mr B.
My final decision
 I uphold this complaint.
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA must pay compensation of £75 to Mr B.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 May 2021.
