The complaint
Mr R believes PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SA acted irresponsibly by agreeing a revolving 
credit account hed applied for.
What happened
On 13 January 2019, Mr R opened a revolving credit account with PayPal. And they 
provided him with a credit limit of £2,500. The minimum payment on this account was set as 
the greater of £5 or 2% of the outstanding balance i.e., £48 a month if Mr R used the full 
£2,400 limit. In June 2019, Mr R entered into a debt management plan (DMP), and PayPal 
defaulted the account in October 2020.
Mr R has complained that PayPal didnt act responsibly when approving the account. Hes 
said that PayPal shouldve seen from his credit report that he was building up large amounts 
of debt. He was also unhappy that the default was applied in October 2020, and he thought 
PayPal shouldve done this sooner. PayPal didnt agree theyd acted irresponsibly, so Mr R 
brought his complaint to us for investigation.
While this complaint was under investigation, PayPal removed the default from Mr Rs credit 
file, and started reporting arrears instead. But Mr R wasnt happy with this  he thought the 
default shouldnt be removed but shouldve been applied earlier than it was.
Our investigator said that, while PayPal had conducted a credit check, they havent been 
able to provide a copy of this. And the copy of his credit file Mr R has supplied showed he 
owed a substantial amount of money to multiple lenders at the time of the application to 
PayPal. The investigator thought these would likely have shown on the credit check PayPal 
performed.
The investigator also said that PayPal had calculated Mr Rs affordability based on a 
declared income range of £2,501 to £3,000, a declared housing cost of £501 to £1,000, and 
declared living expenses of £501 to £1,000. However, given the large amount of unsecured 
debt Mr R had, the investigator didnt think this was a reasonable approach. And he thought 
PayPal shouldve obtained a more thorough understanding of Mr Rs financial 
circumstances.
Given this the investigator didnt think that PayPal had carried out reasonable and 
proportionate checks.
The investigator asked Mr R to provide bank statements from the time of his application to 
PayPal, so he could assess whether the agreement was sustainably affordable. But Mr R 
couldnt provide these. So, the investigator said it wasnt possible to know what PayPal 
wouldve found had they carried out reasonable and proportionate checks. But, as he hadnt 
seen anything to show that these checks wouldve shown Mr R couldnt sustainably afford 
the payments to PayPal, he wasnt persuaded that PayPal had made an unfair lending 
decision.
With regards to the default, the investigator said wed usually expect a default to be 
registered when a customer was between three and six months in arrears. Mr R failed to pay 
the June 2019 payment, and then went into a DMP where he was paying less than the 
minimum payment. So, the investigator thought PayPal shouldve applied the default in 
November 2019, at which point he wouldve been more than three months in arrears.
As Mr R didnt agree that the default shouldve been removed from his credit file, the 
investigator said that PayPal should reinstate this, with a date no later than November 2019.
Mr R accepted the investigators view, but PayPal said we accept the outcome of your 
findings, however there are elements we disagree with., given the circumstances, we believe 
we acted in the best interests of [Mr R], by removing his default to provide a satisfactory 
resolution to his complaint.
Because PayPal had said they accepted the outcome of the complaint, even though they 
didnt fully agree with it, the investigator asked them to carry out his recommendations. 
PayPal said theyd done this, but Mr R said the default still wasnt showing on his credit file. 
The investigator chased them to do this, but PayPal failed to respond. And didnt take any 
further action. As such, this matter has been passed to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When someone complains about irresponsible and/or unaffordable lending, there are two 
overarching questions I need to consider in order to decide whats fair and reasonable in all 
of the circumstances of the complaint. These are:
1. Did PayPal complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr R 
would be able to repay the credit in a sustainable way?
a. if so, did PayPal make a fair lending decision?
b. if not, would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown that Mr R 
could sustainably repay the borrowing?
2. Did PayPal act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
And, if I determine that PayPal didnt act fairly and reasonably when considering Mr Rs 
application, Ill also consider what I think is a fair way to put things right.
Did PayPal complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr R would 
be able to repay the credit in a sustainable way?
Theres no set list for what reasonable and proportionate checks are, but Id expect lenders 
to consider things such as the amount, duration, and payments of the finance being applied 
for; as well as the borrowers personal circumstances at the time of each application. 
PayPal have said that, as part of every application for credit they receive, they undertake 
eligibility, creditworthiness, and affordability checks. And they do this by reviewing the 
customers credit file and the information disclosed by the customer, including their monthly 
income and expenditure. Theyve said they carried out these standard checks for Mr R.PayPal have also explained that the information they receive from the credit reference 
agencies is by way of a complex data file which they havent been able to provide. 
However, theyve said there were no defaults showing on Mr Rs credit file in the 24 months 
before they approved his application.
Mr R has provided a copy of his credit file, and this shows historic data from the time of his 
application to PayPal. In January 2019, Mr R was a total of £7,858 overdrawn with four 
different banks; he had six different revolving credit/credit card accounts, with a total 
outstanding balance of £8,507; and he owed £30,956 on five different loans, with a 
combined monthly payment of £305 a month. In addition to this, the credit file shows 
additional credit commitments that were in force at the time, but for which there is no historic 
account balance data.
I can see no reason why these credit commitments wouldnt be reported on the credit check 
PayPal undertook at the time of Mr Rs application.
In addition to this, PayPal have used Mr Rs declaration of his monthly income and 
expenditure to check affordability. And this declaration had been by way of a range, not an 
actual figure - an income of between £2,501 and £3,000 a month, and housing and living 
expenses totalling between £1,002 and £2,000 a month. In addition to this, the credit check 
shows that Mr R was paying £305 a month in loan repayments, and 2% of his credit card 
balances would give him a minimum payment of £170 a month.
As such, Mr Rs declared outgoing and credit commitments were a maximum of £2,475 a 
month, with a declared income as low as £2,501 a month. Which would only leave Mr R with 
£76 a month to service his £8,507 overdrafts and cover any discretionary expenditure.
So, based on what Ive seen and PayPals comments, Im not satisfied that reasonable 
checks were carried out. And I think that PayPal shouldve carried out more checks to 
establish Mr Rs actual income and expenditure, to see whether payments to this account 
were sustainably affordable to him.
Would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown that Mr R would be able to repay 
the credit in a sustainable way?
In addition to the credit file Mr R has provided, he was asked to provide copies of his bank 
statements from the period just before the application to PayPal was approved. While I 
wouldnt necessarily have expected PayPal to ask for bank statements, I think these 
statements give a good indication of what PayPal would likely have discovered if theyd 
asked about Mr Rs income and expenditure at the time.
However, Mr R hasnt provided this information, nor anything else to show his actual income 
and expenditure at the time. As such, as Mr R hasnt been able to show that he couldnt 
afford to sustainably make payments to PayPal in January 2019, Im unable to conclude that 
reasonable and proportionate checks wouldve shown this.
Did PayPal act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
PayPal have confirmed that Mr R entered into a debt management plan in June 2019, and 
they suspended all fees and charges from that point. Theyve also confirmed that he still 
owes them £1,892.38, to which he pays £16.89 a month. Ive noted that this is less than 1% 
of the outstanding balance, while PayPals minimum payment is 2%.
PayPal have also said that they eventually defaulted Mr Rs account in October 2020.While PayPal havent provided any statement of accounts, so I cant see exactly what Mr R 
paid each month, its not disputed that he missed the June 2019 payment. Nor is it disputed 
that, once he entered into the DMP, Mr R was (and still is) paying less than the minimum 
payment. And, based on the current figures, it will take Mr R more than nine years to repay 
the debt to PayPal.
The Information Commissioners Office says that it would expect a default to be registered by 
the time a customer is at least three months in arrears, and certainly by the time they were 
six months in arrears. As Mr R was paying less than half of what he should to PayPal, he 
wouldve been at least three months in arrears by November 2019. And, as he was in an 
agreed long-term DMP, there is no reason why PayPal would be expecting the arrears 
situation to be resolved quickly. 
Given this, Im in agreement that PayPal shouldve defaulted Mr R by November 2019, and 
that they acted unfairly by waiting until October 2020 to do this.
Putting things right
While PayPal have now removed the default from Mr Rs credit file, they are also reporting 
his account as being in arrears. Theyve also said, on multiple occasions throughout the 
investigation of this complaint, that they have an obligation to correctly report information to 
the credit reference agencies.
When looking at a situation like this, Id expect a financial business to put their customer 
back in the situation they wouldve been, had the financial business acted fairly. And this 
would mean Mr Rs credit file would be showing a default in November 2019, and not an 
undefaulted account with arrears.
So, PayPal should correct their reporting on Mr Rs credit file to show a default in November 
2019.
My final decision
For the reasons explained, I uphold Mr Rs complaint. And PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SA 
should follow my directions above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 September 2023.
