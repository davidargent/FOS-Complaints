The complaint
Miss T complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA lent irresponsibly when they 
approved a credit limit of £1,500 for her. 
What happened
In March 2018, Miss T made an online application to open a PayPal credit account. The 
application asked Miss T to provide basic information about her income and expenditure and 
PayPal completed a credit search. Miss T completed the application online and in April 2018 
she was approved for a credit limit of £1.500. Miss T said she struggled to keep up with 
repayments and only ever paid the minimum amount. She said she had other credit  
commitments payable at high interest rates. Miss T complained to PayPal as she said theyd  
acted irresponsibly in lending to her.
PayPal said theyd checked whether the PayPal account was sustainable for Miss T by 
carrying out eligibility, creditworthiness and affordability checks before making the decision 
to lend to her. They said Miss T had sufficient monthly disposal income to meet her credit 
commitments, and shed hadnt missed any repayments until her circumstances changed in 
September 2020, when she lost her job.
Miss T wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred her complaint to us.
Our investigator said PayPal hadnt acted irresponsibly in lending to Miss T.
Miss T didnt agree she said that PayPal shouldnt have increased her credit commitments. 
She asked for an ombudsman to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know Miss T will be disappointed but having done so Im not upholding this complaint. Ill 
explain why.
PayPal offer a revolving credit product with a credit limit attached to the consumers 
PayPal account which can be used to purchase goods online. The requirement being to 
repay at least the minimum amount due on any outstanding balance each month.
Theres no set list of checks a lender must complete before agreeing to provide credit. We 
look at whether a business has completed proportionate checks to ensure the
proposed credit is affordable and sustainable.
In considering what is fair and reasonable I have taken into account relevant law and
regulations; regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and what I
consider having been good industry practice at the time.
Taking this into account, I think the overarching questions I need to consider in deciding
whats fair and reasonable in the circumstance of this complaint are:
1. Did PayPal complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy themselves that 
Miss T would be able to repay the credit in a sustainable way?
a. if so, did PayPal Money make a fair lending decision?
b. if not, would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown that Miss T
could sustainably repay the borrowing?
2. Did PayPal act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
In this case, the PayPal application asked Miss T for information about her income and
overall outgoings, residential status and address. Miss T said she was in full time 
employment, living with her parents, and had an income between £1,001 and £1,500 per 
month. Her outgoings were said to be up to £500 per month. PayPal calculated that Miss T 
was a mid to low lending risk as shed around £1,000 disposable income each month.
PayPal went on to complete a credit search to look at how Miss T handled the other credit 
she had. These checks showed that Miss T wasnt over indebted, and that there wasnt any 
adverse information on Miss Ts credit file. PayPal also considered Miss Ts history with 
them and said her Wallet account had been well run.
From what Ive seen, I think these checks were proportionate for the type of borrowing here. 
I appreciate the information PayPal asks for is broad in its nature and income and 
expenditure figures arent specific. But Im satisfied PayPal asked reasonable questions 
during the application process and used data analysis from a credit reference agency to see 
whether the borrowing was sustainable.
Taking everything Ive seen into account, Ive not been persuaded that PayPal lent
irresponsibly when it approved Miss Ts credit limit in April 2018. And I havent seen any 
evidence that PayPal offered or gave Miss T any further increases to the agreed £1,500 
credit limit.
I appreciate Miss Ts experiencing financial difficulties after her employment ended, and she 
is finding it hard to maintain her payments. I can see that PayPal agreed to a payment 
holiday and is looking to agree a payment plan based on Miss Ts current income and 
expenditure. From what Ive seen PayPal has treated Miss T positively and sympathetically 
when shes made contact to discuss her circumstances. Lenders can consider a range of 
options for customers in financial difficulty but that doesnt mean theyre obliged to refund or 
waive interest. And from what Ive seen Im satisfied PayPal is willing to work with Miss T to 
provide support to help her with her financial difficulties..My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2023.
