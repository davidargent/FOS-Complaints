The complaint
Mr M complains that NewDay Limited (NewDay) have unfairly defaulted his credit card 
account and informed credit reference agencies which has damaged his credit score. He 
would like it to amend the references. 
What happened
Mr M had a credit card account with NewDay. In October 2018 Mr M was sent to prison. In 
November 2018 a charity (S) wrote to several businesses with whom Mr M had 
arrangements explaining the situation and asking that accounts be put on hold. 
When Mr M was released in October 2019, he checked his credit score and found the 
NewDay account had been defaulted and his credit score was much worse than previously. 
He says this will make hit harder for him to rebuild his life. He also became aware that 
NewDay had sold the account to another business (C) in April 2019. S wrote to NewDay on 
Mr Ms behalf. NewDay said it wasnt aware of Mr M circumstances as Ss first letter hadnt 
been received. It said Mr M needed to talk to C.
Mr M said C was helpful and explained it couldnt change the credit file record as it was 
NewDay who had defaulted the account and he should get back in touch with it again. 
NewDay said if it had been aware of the circumstances it would have placed a block on the 
account which would have prevented it being sold. Mr M said as S could show it had sent 
the letter, NewDay should amend the credit record, but it declined.
Mr M complained to NewDay. It rejected the complaint. It confirmed it wasnt aware of his 
circumstances until October 2019. It said its policy was to provide credit reference agencies 
(CRAs) with information about how customers handled their accounts. And that it was within 
its rights to sell the account to another business if it wanted to. Mr M brought his complaint to 
us.
Our investigator looked into it. S provided copies of the letter it had sent and Mr Ms 
probation officer confirmed that a letter had been written to NewDay. Our investigator asked 
NewDay if it would consider amending the credit file in the circumstances. NewDay replied 
that even had been aware and applied the block it would only have prevented the account 
being sold.  It wouldnt have stopped the account being terminated once the it exceeded 90 
days of arrears which it had in December 2018 and the default being recorded. NewDay said 
the account had been correctly defaulted and the reports to the CRAs were accurate and 
didnt think they should be altered.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. He said it was a very unfortunate situation but 
NewDay hadnt made any error in defaulting the account and in reporting information about 
this to the CRAs. He said it wouldnt be fair to ask NewDay to make an exception for Mr M 
as this would be treating him differently from other customers.
Mr M disagreed with the decision. He said he had done everything in his power to notify 
NewDay of his circumstances and could prove the letter had been sent. He said he was just 
asking NewDay for some compassion to help him rebuild his life. As Mr M doesnt agree it 
has come to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I am not upholding the complaint. Ill explain why.
Its unfortunate NewDay didnt get the letter from S. Had it been received NewDay could 
have explained its position and Mr M would have been better informed. But I think the only 
thing that would have changed the outcome would have been if Mr M could have come to 
some form of payment arrangement to prevent the account being defaulted. But Mr M didnt 
do that. 
I also have to take into account that the relevant guidelines here set by the Information 
Commissioners Office say that a business can generally look to default an account around 
three to six months after contractual payments havent been made. NewDay took this action 
after 90 days  so this is in line with these guidelines.
The terms and conditions (T&Cs) of the account require payments to be made and NewDay 
has shown evidence that it issued the necessary notices when defaulting the account, which 
Mr M didnt receive. But that doesnt mean that NewDay has acted unfairly here, or that it 
shouldnt have taken the actions it did in relation to his account. It was entitled to do so in the 
circumstances. So overall, the information provided to the CRAs appears to be accurate, 
which is what Id expect.
I can see this is important this is to Mr M and have great sympathy for his situation. But as I 
dont think NewDay has done anything wrong here, I cant ask them to make an exception to 
its procedures as these have been fairly and reasonably applied in the circumstances.
My final decision
My final decision is that I that I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 December 2020.
