K821x#15complaint
Miss T says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny (ECI)  irresponsibly lent to 
her.
background
This complaint is about 11 instalment loans which ECI provided to Miss T between 
November 2015  and May 2018. Miss Ts borrowing history  is as follows:
Loan number Date Taken Date Closed Amount 
borrowed £Monthly 
Repayment £
1 19/11/2015 01/03/2016 1,500 213.98
2 08/04/2016 17/08/2016 500 68.39
3 12/07/2016 17/08/2016 300 40.35
4 03/10/2016 04/11/2016 1,000 138.06
5 26/10/2016 04/11/2016 600 84.76
6 20/02/2017 02/05/2017 300 38.93

9 02/08/2017 10/11/2017 1,200 166.69
10 25/01/2018 02/05/2018 1,000 142.15
11 28/05/2018 02/08/2018 500 70.75
Miss T complained that she could not recall any checks being  made  and that she was 
allowed to borrow far more than she could afford.  She found  it stressful  having to borrow  to 
pay her rent and other bills. So she concludes loans ECI loaned to her irresponsibly.
Our adjudicator rejected  Miss Ts complaint about loans 1-6. We havent  had any comments  
about this from Miss T or ECI, so in this decision, I will only need  to look at the remaining 
loans.
Our adjudicator then upheld Miss Ts complaint  and thought loans 7 and 8 shouldnt have 
been given. 
In the meantime, ECI upheld Miss Ts complaint  on loans 9, 10 and 11. ECI offered full 
redress to Miss T which is in line with our approach and this offer has not been  rejected by 
Miss T. So I wont  need to look at the merits of the complaint about loans 9,10 and 11, 
although I will refer to them for completeness and clarity.
None of the parties commented on our adjudicators view about loans 7 and 8, so the matter  
was passed to me to look at again.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN18896182ECI needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss T could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that ECI should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that ECI was required to establish whether 
Miss T could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of ECIs lending history with Miss T, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which ECI should  reasonably  have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so ECI should have  realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ts case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
At this point ECI ought to have realised Miss T was not managing  to repay  her loans 
sustainably. Miss T had taken out 7 loans within 16 months. So ECI ought  to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Miss T was having to borrow  further  to cover the 
hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Ts 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN18896183Miss Ts first loan was for £1,500 and loan 7 was for £500. At this point ECI ought to 
have known that Miss T was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in her 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
From  loan 7 onwards  Miss T was sometimes provided with a new loan within 
days/weeks of settling a previous one. 
Miss T wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed ECI. Loan 11 was 
taken out around 41 months after Miss Ts first. And it was for a larger  amount. Miss 
T had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to ECI over an 
extended period.
I think that Miss T lost out because ECI continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ts indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Miss T borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ts ability to access mainstream  credit  and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 7 to 11. ECI has already made an offer 
which is in line with our approach  on loans 9 to 11 and so now ECI should  also put things 
right for Miss T in respect of loans 7 and 8. For the sake  of clarity and in recognition of ECIs 
offer, I will refer to all of the loans  numbered 7 to 11 when considering  how ECI is to put 
things right for Miss T.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss T paid on loans 7 to 11 (inclusive);
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 11 (inclusive)  should  be 
removed from Miss Ts credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit International  Limited to take off tax from 
this interest. Elevate  Credit International Limited must give Miss T a certificate showing how 
much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ts complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right for Miss T as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 March 2020.
