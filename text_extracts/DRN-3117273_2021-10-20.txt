The complaint
Mr M complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA lent to him irresponsibly and when he
contacted it for help, he wasnt treated fairly.  
What happened
In June 2017 Mr M applied for a PayPal credit account online. He was given a £2,000
credit limit.
In April 2020 Mr M told PayPal he was in financial difficulties. It agreed to a payment
holiday for three months, which was later extended by a further three months.
In October 2020 Mr M told PayPal he was unable to make his repayments and offered
£1 a month. PayPal accepted Mr Ms offer of £1 a month in November 2020.
Mr M has several complaint points, which Ill summarise as follows:
- Hes disabled and lives on benefits, so it was irresponsible for PayPal to lend to 
him;
- His disabilities mean he doesnt properly understand terms and conditions, which 
has resulted in him paying a large amount of interest, which is unfair;
- PayPal hasnt taken his accessibility needs into account when communicating 
with him; and
- PayPal hasnt agreed to write off his outstanding balance despite being made 
aware of the long-standing nature of his circumstances.
The investigator didnt think PayPal had acted unfairly. She concluded, in summary, that:
- It was reasonable for PayPal to lend to Mr M given his credit history;
- She didnt think she could fairly say PayPal was wrong to lend to him on health 
grounds as it wouldnt have been aware of them at the time of the lending 
decision;
- When PayPal became aware of Mr Ms circumstances in 2020, it agreed to 
repayments of £1 a month and to suspend interest and charges, which was 
reasonable; and
- She accepted PayPal had asked to speak to Mr M on the phone, which wasnt 
suitable for him. But noted it also communicated by email, so she thought itd 
taken his accessibility needs into account.
PayPal didnt challenge our investigators findings. Mr M did. He said, in summary,
PayPal was wrong to accept his application as he didnt have the mental capacity to
understand the contract he was entering into. He also said he still thought PayPal should
write off his outstanding balance as other lenders had.
The investigator had further correspondence with PayPal. It remained of the opinion it
hadnt done anything wrong. But given Mr Ms personal circumstances it offered to
ringfence his account, meaning he wouldnt be contacted about his outstanding balance
(about £3,300) and the account wouldnt be passed to debt collection agencies.
The investigator put PayPals offer to Mr M but he didnt accept it. He thought PayPal
should write off the debt, which is something his other creditors had done. As an
agreement couldnt be reached the complaint was passed to me to decide.
I issued a provisional decision, in which I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr M applied for credit with PayPal and his application was approved. He says it 
shouldnt have been. But at this point Im not persuaded it makes a material 
difference given PayPals offer. Ill explain why.
If I were to conclude PayPal had lent to Mr M when it shouldnt have Id likely require 
it to refund the interest and charges applied to the account. If I were to do that, some 
of what Mr M owes would still be outstanding. So PayPals offer  not to ask him to 
repay what he owes  is more favourable to him.
Mr M says his debt should be written off. I understand his other creditors have done 
this. Im also aware of  and sorry to hear about  Mr Ms difficult personal 
circumstances. But write off amounts to what PayPal has agreed to do, which is not 
to ask him to repay the debt and not to pass the debt on to anyone else. The result is 
the same  he wont need to repay the debt.
PayPal hasnt offered to remove information related to this account from Mr Ms 
credit file. I think thats reasonable given the credit Mr M used isnt going to be 
repaid. PayPal hasnt offered Mr M any compensation either. Im mindful Mr M thinks 
it should, in part because of the customer service hes received. But here, given Mr M 
has had the benefit of money he wont have to repay, I dont think compensation is 
appropriate.
My provisional decision
Im satisfied PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCAs offer to ensure Mr M isnt 
contacted about his outstanding balance and confirmation it wouldnt pass it to 
debt collection agencies is a fair resolution to this complaint. So my provisional 
decision is that PayPal should do as its offered.
PayPal didnt respond to my provisional decision. Mr M responded with a query but 
indicated his agreement to the proposed settlement. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has disagreed with my provisional decision, I see no reason to depart from 
it. It follows I remain of the opinion PayPals offer is a fair resolution to this complaint.  
Putting things rightPayPal should ensure Mr M isnt contacted about his outstanding balance and should not 
pass it to debt collection agencies.  
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to put things right - in 
line with its offer - as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 November 2021.
