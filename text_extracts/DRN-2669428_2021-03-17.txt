The complaint
Mr B complains that he was mis-sold a Premium Account (PA) by Revolut Ltd (Revolut) in 
May 2019.
What happened
Mr B says that he bought a PA because he wanted the Airport Lounge access it provided. 
When he tried to use it for the first time, he says he was declined entry to the Airport Lounge, 
so he paid £25 to go in on that occasion and then cancelled his PA immediately.
Revolut says Mr B only paid one months fee for the PA and it has refunded that fee to him. 
Mr B wants Revolut to refund him the £25 for the lounge access he paid when he tried to use 
the PA benefit and pay him distress and inconvenience compensation.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mr Bs complaint. Mr B disagrees, so the complaint has come 
to me to consider.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
If I were to find that the PA had been mis-sold, the redress I would have awarded would be 
for Revolut to refund the account fees that Mr B paid to him. It has already done this.
When Mr B reached the Airport Lounge and was declined entry despite having a PA, in my 
view, even if I decided the PA had been mis-sold, it was for Mr B to decide whether he would 
pay for entry that day or not, and he decided to do so. I therefore do not agree that Revolut 
should pay his entry fee.
Mr B has asked for a distress and inconvenience payment as he was refused entry to the 
lounge. Again, even if I decided that the PA was mis-sold, this service would not award a 
payment for any distress and inconvenience of this kind.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 April 2021.
