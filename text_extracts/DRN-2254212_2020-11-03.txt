The complaint
Ms P complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, (trading as Barclaycard), mis-sold her a credit
card payment protection insurance, (PPI), policy.
What happened
The background to this complaint, together with my provisional findings, is set out in my 
provisional decision dated 8 September 2020, a copy of which is attached to this decision.
Neither Ms P nor Barclays made any further comments or provided new information  
following receipt of my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about payment protection insurance on
our website. Ive followed this in Ms Ps case.
In the absence of any other information or comments about the sale and its surrounding 
circumstances since I drafted it, I see no reason to change the findings or decision I set out 
in my provisional decision.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive set out above and in my provisional decision, my decision is that I do 
not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2020.
