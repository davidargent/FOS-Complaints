K821x#15complaint
Mr H says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He 
says appropriate  checks wouldve  shown Sunny that he was in financial turmoil and that it 
shouldnt have lent to him. 
background
This complaint is about 16 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr H between  
September 2015 and June 2017. Ive produced a table below that shows some of the 
information that Sunny has provided about this lending.

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She didnt think  that Sunny was wrong to lend 
loans 1 to 5. But she thought that it shouldnt have  approved loans 6 to 11 as the lending 
pattern itself was harmful. And whilst there  was a break in the lending  between 
loans 11 and 12, she thought that the information Sunny had recorded about Mr H showed 
that he couldnt afford to repay  this lending sustainably. 
Sunny agreed  with the adjudicator about  loans  12 to 16. But it disagreed with the 
adjudicators opinion about  loans  6 to 11. And Mr H didnt accept the offer Sunny made 
about loans 12 to 16. 
So as no agreement has been reached, the complaint has been  passed to me.
Ref: DRN74832082my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.  Ive decided to uphold Mr Hs 
complaint in part and I have explained  why below.
Mr H didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 5. And Sunny  agreed 
with our adjudicators  findings about loans 12 to 16. 
Because of this I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  these  loans. So I wont  
be making a decision  about this lending.  But they were part of the borrowing relationship 
Mr H had with Sunny. So they are something I will take into account when considering the 
other loans  Mr H took. And I have included the compensation  for loans 12 to 16 in my 
putting things  right section below. 
Ref: DRN74832083I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 11 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  
history with Mr H, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which  Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr H was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr H had taken out 6 loans in just over two months. And this was the 
third time Mr H had borrowed and repaid his loans  in a very short space of time. So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was likely that Mr Hs indebtedness  was increasing 
unsustainably.
Over  the total time he borrowed, Mr H was often provided with a new loan within  a 
few days of settling  a previous one (other than one break  in lending). And he often 
had more than one loan running at the same  time.
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  11 was 
taken out around four months after Mr Hs first loan. And Mr H had started to borrow 
much larger  amounts. I think this is a clear sign that he was struggling financially.
I think that Mr H lost out as Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over a longer period  of time.
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Hs ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 16 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 6 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 12 to 16 from Mr Hs credit file;
the number  of loans taken over loans 6 to 11 means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 11 should be removed from Mr Hs 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN74832084my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Hs complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 July 2020.
