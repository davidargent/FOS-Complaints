Complaint
Miss H is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed her accounts and 
then denied her access to her funds. 
Background
In May 2021, NatWest took the decision to close Miss Hs two foundation accounts and her 
savings account. NatWest told Miss H that this was a course of action it was entitled to take 
and it didnt need to provide her with a reason for its decision. 
Miss H was unhappy with this and the fact that she was told it could take up to 60 days for 
her to be able to access the funds in her accounts. And she complained to NatWest about 
these matters. NatWest didnt uphold Miss Hs complaint. Miss H remained dissatisfied and 
asked us to look into the matter.
One of our adjudicators looked into Miss Hs concerns. She thought that NatWest had 
treated Miss H unfairly and thought that it should pay Miss H £250 in compensation. 
NatWest didnt respond to our adjudicators assessment so the complaint was passed to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered matters, Ive decided to uphold Miss Hs complaint. Ill explain 
why in a little more detail. 
In truth, having looked at matters here, Im not entirely convinced that NatWest has even 
properly investigated, or even understands, what has happened in this case. I say this 
because its submission to our adjudicator said it had the right to close Miss Hs accounts, 
without providing her with a reason, because it provided with 60-days notice before doing 
so. 
I accept that NatWest, or any other bank for that matter, is under no obligation to continue 
offering an account to a customer if it doesnt wish to do so. And that NatWest may have 
been entitled to take the decision that it no longer wanted Miss H as a customer. But 
NatWests own terms and conditions required it to provide 60-days notice before closing an 
account. This is to allow a customer to make alternative arrangements with a different bank. 
And while NatWest has suggested it provided 60-days notice here, the screenshot it has 
provided as well as the template letter provided to show what Miss H is likely to have 
received, both suggest that NatWest only provided Miss H with 14-days notice before 
closing her accounts. And NatWest is only able to close a customers account with such 
short notice where it has a certain specified reason, listed in the terms and conditions, to do 
so. 
Despite repeated requests NatWest has not provided Miss H, or us, with anything to show 
that the conditions for closure at such short notice existed here. For the sake of 
completeness, Id also add that Miss Hs foundation accounts appeared to be the equivalent 
of basic bank accounts. And basic bank accounts can only typically be closed, with 60-days 
notice in certain specific circumstances, rather than without reason. NatWest hasnt showed 
that these reasons exist here either. That said, as Miss H has since been able to open a 
basic bank account elsewhere, I dont think it would be appropriate for me to require 
NatWest to reopen her foundation accounts. 
Miss H has explained that NatWest closing her accounts immediately and without notice 
caused her a lot of distress. She had to manually move all her direct debits at short-notice 
and she was left without funds for a significant period. And even though, NatWest returned 
Miss Hs funds within the 60 days specified in its terms and conditions, which seems an 
excessive period in circumstances where it only gave her 14 days to make alternative 
arrangements before closing her accounts in the first place, Im mindful that Miss H will have 
experienced a significant amount of inconvenience given she was a single parent with a 
number of dependents. 
Most importantly, I think that all of this would have been avoided if NatWest had treated  
Miss H fairly and reasonably and provided her with reasonable notice before closing her 
account, should it have been the case that it was entitled to. As this is the case, I think that 
NatWest should pay Miss H £250 in compensation for the significant distress and 
inconvenience its actions in unfairly closing Miss Hs account without notice caused.  
Overall and having considered everything, Im satisfied that NatWest didnt have sufficient 
grounds to close Miss Hs accounts with only 14-days notice, if it was even entitled to close 
the accounts at all. As this is the case, I find that it was unfair for NatWest to close Miss Hs 
accounts in the way that it did. So Im upholding Miss Hs complaint and NatWest needs to 
pay Miss H £250 in compensation.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Miss Hs complaint. National Westminster 
Bank Plc should pay Miss H £250 in compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 August 2022.
