DRN-1606476
The complaint
Mr N complains that Lloyds Bank PLC has failed to locate his deposit account. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Businesses dont have to retain information indefinitely. Whilst I understand Mr N has 
found evidence that he had a deposit account with Lloyds, that doesnt mean the 
account remains open. Lloyds has confirmed that it was possible to close this type of 
account without presenting the passbook. 
If the account remained open with an active balance Id have expected Lloyds to 
trace it using Mr Ns personal information. Lloyds has provided evidence that shows it 
was able to locate other accounts for Mr N, but not the deposit account in question. If 
the account had been made dormant, Id have expected it to appear on the dormant 
account register. As Lloyds didnt find an open account and it doesnt appear on the 
dormant account register Im satisfied the deposit account no longer exists. 
I think it's more likely than not that the funds were withdrawn and the account was 
closed. 
I'm sorry to disappoint Mr N but I'm satisfied Lloyds has dealt with his complaint fairly, 
so I'm not telling it to do anything else. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 August 2020.
