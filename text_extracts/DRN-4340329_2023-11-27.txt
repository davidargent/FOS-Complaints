The complaint
Mr C complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt pay his credit balance 
to him when it closed his account.
What happened
Mr C held an account with NatWest. In April 2022, NatWest closed the account due to 
inactivity. It had a credit balance of around £350 at the time. But this wasnt paid to Mr C 
when the account was closed, so he raised a complaint.
NatWest responded to the complaint In October 2022. It accepted that the funds should 
have been sent to Mr C when his account was closed. It said there had been a bank error 
and apologised. It offered him compensation of £75 for the distress and inconvenience 
caused. NatWest said that the compensation would be paid to Mr C by cheque and asked 
whether this should be addressed to Mr C himself or someone else to pay in for him.
NatWest also said it had set out in writing what Mr C needed to do to reclaim the account 
balance. It said this information had been sent to a third party who Mr C had given NatWest 
permission to communicate with on his behalf.
But Mr C wasnt happy with NatWests response and brought the complaint to this service. 
He wanted NatWest to return his funds straight away and pay him compensation to reflect 
the fact that he had waited so long for his money. He said he had spent time calling, writing 
and sending emails but the situation still wasnt resolved. He said that not having access to 
his funds had impacted his mental and physical health.
Our Investigator thought NatWest had acted fairly and didnt ask it to do any more. But Mr C 
didnt agree. He still hasnt received his funds and says that £75 isnt enough compensation 
given how many months hes been waiting to get his money back. He asked for the 
complaint to be reviewed by an Ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest accepts that the credit balance from Mr Cs account should have been paid to him 
when the account was closed. So, I dont need to look into whether that should have 
happened or when. Instead, Ill focus on whether NatWest has done enough to put things 
right following its mistake.
When Mr C first complained, NatWest requested some further information so that it could 
investigate fully. Once it had this information, it upheld the complaint and wrote to Mr C in 
October 2022 to tell him this. It told Mr C in its final response letter that it had written to the 
person hed given permission for it to communicate with, explaining what Mr C needed to do 
to reclaim his funds. Im satisfied that NatWest sent an email to a third party in November 
2022. This explained that Mr C needed to either send an email or write to NatWest to reclaim 
his funds. The email address and postal address were provided in this email. It explained 
that Mr C would need to provide evidence of his identity and current residential address. It 
confirmed the documents it would accept to satisfy these requirements. It said that Mr C 
would also need to provide details of where to transfer the funds. 
NatWest said that, once it received this information from Mr C, it could start the retrieval 
process so that Mr C could receive his funds. So, I find that NatWest set out the steps which 
Mr C needed to take in order to retrieve his funds. It provided this information in November 
2022 to a third party on Mr Cs behalf. I think that was fair. It appears that this information 
didnt reach Mr C, which is very unfortunate. But I dont think that was NatWests fault. 
I have asked our Investigator to send a hard copy of the email to Mr C in the post, so that he 
can see what he needs to do to recover his money. I think the steps that NatWest is asking 
Mr C to take are reasonable. Some of them would have been required even if NatWest had 
paid the funds to him at the time it closed the account (such as providing details of where to 
send the funds). But I think some of the other steps are only necessary because NatWest 
didnt pay the funds to Mr C when it should have done, meaning he now has to go through 
the reclaims process. This adds to the stress and inconvenience for Mr C.
But NatWest has already said it will pay him compensation of £75. I think thats fair in the 
circumstances here to reflect the fact that the funds werent paid to Mr C when the account 
was closed and that he has to actively take steps to retrieve them now. The account was 
closed in April 2022 and NatWest provided details of how to retrieve the funds in November 
2022. From the information Ive seen, I dont think NatWest knew about the complaint until 
August 2022 and it didnt have all the information it needed to respond until October 2022. 
So I dont think it caused unnecessary delay in providing the relevant information to Mr C. 
The £75 hasnt been paid yet. But thats because NatWest is waiting to hear from Mr C 
about who the cheque should be payable to. I would urge Mr C to provide this information as 
soon as possible, together with details of where the cheque should be sent. NatWest is also 
waiting for the requested information from Mr C so that it can send his account balance to 
him. Again, I would encourage Mr C to provide this information as soon as possible.
I realise Mr C will be disappointed by my decision, and Im sorry for that. But I think NatWest 
has done enough to put things right after its initial mistake. And I dont think its responsible 
for all the delays here. So, Im not going to ask it to do any more.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 December 2023.
