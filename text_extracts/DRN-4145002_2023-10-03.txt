The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-led him regarding 
whether he could use money held with it to invest in crypto currency. This resulted in him 
losing the ISA status on the funds he was going to invest.
What happened
Mr D held an ISA with a third party investment service. Mr D says in June 2021 he was 
advised to invest in a crypto currency. Knowing of the banking sectors aversion to crypto Mr 
D says he decided to approach NatWest about the proposed investment to see whether it 
would obstruct or prevent him from using funds held with it for investing.
Mr D both called and visited a branch of NatWest to seek this advice. Mr D says his notes of 
the conversation record that he was asked what the purpose of the transfer was, so it 
wouldve been clear to NatWest his intentions. Mr D says he was advised as it was a large 
payment, he should do it by CHAPS and that internal checks were carried out prior to 
authorising payments and that in response he asked:
I wondered whether in particular for a crypto investment transfer the bank would have 
special conditions we would have to satisfy?.   
Mr D says many points were made to him to suggest the riskiness of such an investment, 
but he was told nothing to indicate that a payment or transfer for crypto investment would be 
treated in any particular way. So in July 2021 Mr D moved around £110,000 out of his ISA 
held with a third party and transferred this to his account with NatWest and wrote a cheque 
for around £176,000.
Following this Mr D says he was called into a branch to talk to NatWests fraud department 
regarding the payment and was eventually told NatWest would not authorise the payment. 
Mr D complained to NatWest about this around 16 months later. He says he didnt raise his 
complaint earlier because he spent time looking about to see whether he could do a crypto 
investment with another agency and was exploring future possibilities.
NatWest says that it had made no error and acted in line with its terms and conditions. It 
says it has a duty of care to protect its customers from the threat of scams and that as it had 
concerns about this payment it was blocked. 
Mr D was dis-satisfied with this, he says NatWest was in a position to tell him he wouldnt be 
able to invest when he made his initial enquires but failed to do so, instead, led him to 
believe there would be no special difficulty because of the involvement of crypto. Mr D says 
the movement of the funds resulted in the loss of the ISA status and brought his complaint to 
this service.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ds concerns and reached the conclusion that 
NatWest had acted in line with its terms and conditions and its policy and procedures when 
the payment was declined so they thought the actions NatWest took were reasonable.
Mr D disagreed and so the complaint was passed to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I hope that Mr D wont take it as a discourtesy that Ive condensed his complaint in the way 
that I have. Ours is an informal dispute resolution service and Ive concentrated on what I 
consider to be the crux of the complaint  our rules allow me to do that.
And the crux of Mr Ds complaint is that he was mis-led regarding the ability for him to make 
a payment out of his NatWest account to invest in crypto currency which resulted in him 
losing the ISA wrapper for these funds. 
It might be helpful for me to say here that, as we are not the regulator, I cannot make the 
bank change its policies or procedures  such as how transfers are made or what will be 
authorised. We offer an informal dispute resolution service and we have no regulatory or 
disciplinary role. 
My role is to look at problems that Mr D has experienced and see if NatWest has done 
anything wrong. If it has, Id seek to put Mr D back in the position he wouldve been in if the 
mistakes hadnt happened. And we may award compensation that we think is fair and 
reasonable.
The first question I have to ask is whether NatWest did anything wrong in not authorising the 
payment Mr D wished to make from his account held with NatWest. And I dont think it did. 
As Ive already explained above although its not for me to tell NatWest run its business, I 
would expect NatWest to have policies and processes in place to protect it and its customers 
against fraud. And NatWests terms and conditions allow it to take certain actions  including 
not making a payment  if it has concerns such as in this case. 
Mr D himself was aware of concerns surrounding crypto currency, so I dont think it was 
unreasonable for NatWest to take the action it did when deciding not to authorise the 
payment when after questioning Mr D about it had legitimate concerns as to where the funds 
were going.
And moving on to the crux of Mr Ds complaint, I dont think Ive seen enough to show me 
that NatWest mis-led Mr D into believing it would make the transfer without question. As the 
way Mr D has explained things regarding the advice he sought from NatWest, it feels very 
much like the questions Mr D put to NatWest were asked in a hypothetic way and that 
NatWest wasnt given a lot of detail - such as who he wanted to make a payment to. This is 
supported by NatWests internal notes which record that Mr D was given general scam 
advice for an investment he was thinking of making. 
Hence, NatWests need to ask further questions when Mr D did go ahead and try and make 
the payment. I think it was likely a case of Mr D hearing the answer he wished to hear.
In any case Im not persuaded the outcome wouldve been any different had NatWest told Mr 
D the payment would be blocked. I say this as I think hed made the decision he wanted to 
invest his money this way and if he couldnt use NatWest to make the payment I think he 
wouldve likely tried to find another business that would. 
Indeed, Mr D in his own words says he spent some time after the failed payment looking for 
alternative investments crypto or otherwise. And it wasnt NatWests actions that caused the loss of ISA protection, it was Mr Ds by selling the investments held in the ISA and 
transferring the proceeds out to his account held at NatWest. The ISA status had been lost 
before NatWest decided to block the payment.
So it follows that I do not uphold Mr Ds complaint as I cant see that NatWest made a 
mistake or treated Mr D unfairly.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I do not uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 October 2023.
