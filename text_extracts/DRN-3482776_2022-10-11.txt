The complaint
Mr C complains that NewDay Ltd has acted unfairly in issuing default notices on two 
accounts he holds with it and recording adverse information about those accounts with the 
credit reference agencies (CRAs).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here in detail. But in summary:
Mr C had two credit card accounts with NewDay  Card 1 and Card 2
In late 2021 he agreed a payment holiday for both accounts and then repayment 
plans for both accounts via a debt advice agency
Mr C then complained about adverse information that NewDay had recorded with the 
CRAs about one of the accounts
Subsequently the default process was started for both accounts, and Mr C 
complained that he had not been properly notified that this might happen
NewDay considered Mr Cs complaints and acknowledged it could have better 
explained the process regarding Mr Cs initial payment holiday. It made a payment of 
£40 to Mr C to recognise the impact of this. NewDay also went on to acknowledge it 
hadnt sent one of the termination notices it should have, so it offered to pay Mr C 
£50 to recognize the impact of this error, but it didnt think it had done anything else 
wrong
Mr C asked our service for an independent review and the investigator thought 
NewDays offer was a reasonable way to resolve this complaint
Mr C didnt accept the investigators findings, so the complained has been passed to me to 
decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
To maintain his credit card accounts  and therefore avoid adverse information being 
reported to the CRAs  Mr C needed to make at least minimum repayments by certain due 
dates each month. 
In October 2021 Mr C struggled with repayments as a result of being stuck overseas due to 
injury and illness. Initially NewDay agreed to offer him temporary help by suspending interest 
and charges until 27 December 2021. But Mr C then began dealing with a debt management 
agency, and in early November 2021 that agency put forward a request on his behalf for 
repayment plans on both of his NewDay accounts. NewDay agreed to the plans, for £1 per 
month for each account, with a review of the plans set for May 2022. 
In my view NewDays actions here were reasonable, it had been told that Mr C could only 
offer a token payment to the account  which suggested that he was in severe financial 
difficulties. So it agreed to accept a token payment each month for six months and to 
suspend interest and charges on his accounts. I havent seen anything to suggest NewDay 
said this wouldnt impact Mr Cs credit file. And I consider it would be reasonable for such 
plans to be reflected on Mr Cs credit file given that they were for such a minimal amount and 
would be in place for an extended period of time.
I appreciate that Mr C says NewDay didnt make it clear that his accounts might default. But 
Ive listened to recordings of some of Mr Cs conversations with NewDay and NewDay 
explained the arrears on his accounts would continue to accrue and that as he was making 
such a small payment each month, there was still the possibility that his accounts could be 
closed and defaulted if the arrears reached a certain level.
On 29 December 2021 NewDay issued a default notice for Card 1. This notice explained that 
unless Mr C was able to repay the arrears on his account (around £167 at this stage) by 19 
January 2022 then his credit agreement would be terminated and the full balance of his 
account would become due. NewDay also explained it would share details of the status of 
Mr Cs account with the CRAs.
Mr C called NewDay to discuss this letter on 6 January 2022, so its clear he received it in 
time to take action regarding repaying the arrears if he was able to. I appreciate that 
NewDay then failed to send the termination notice, but given that NewDay had clearly 
explained to Mr C the timeline of what would happen if he didnt pay the arrears on his 
account, I dont think the failure to issue the termination notice has materially disadvantaged 
Mr C here, he was still aware of what he needed to do to prevent his account from being 
terminated and ultimately defaulted.
On 11 January 2022 NewDay issued a default notice for Card 2. This notice explained Mr C 
had until 1 February 2022 to repay the arrears of around £175 or a termination notice would 
be sent and details of the status of his account would be shared with the CRAs. On 3 
February 2022 NewDay then issued the termination notice saying that the full balance of this 
account was now due.
Mr C has said these notices were sent to him via secure messaging on NewDays website, 
but that as no notification was sent to him via email or SMS he wasnt aware of the notices 
until it was too late. But Mr C was aware that NewDay might use the secure messaging 
service to send him important information about his accounts  hes told us he had asked 
NewDay to correspond with him via either email or secure messaging on the website. And I 
think given the situation he was in and that hed been made aware of the possibility that his 
accounts might be terminated, he should have been regularly checking his messages about 
these accounts so he didnt miss any important information. And with all this in mind Im 
satisfied that NewDay did enough to make Mr C aware of the situation with his accounts and 
what he needed to do to avoid the eventual defaults and termination.
So overall, I havent seen any evidence to show that Mr C was told the plans hed agreed 
wouldnt impact his credit file, and in my view NewDay did enough to make it clear to Mr C 
what the impact of the plans might be and what he would need to do to avoid any defaults. I 
acknowledge that NewDay didnt send Mr C one of the termination letters, but for the 
reasons Ive explained Im satisfied that this error didnt impact his ability to avoid the default 
if he was able to, so Im satisfied that NewDays offer to pay Mr C £50 to recognise the 
impact of this error is fair.I understand the information recorded on Mr Cs credit file will have an impact on him. But 
Mr C was missing contractual repayments to his accounts for an extended period of time, 
and was unable to bring those accounts back in order when requested to do so by NewDay. 
This  is important account information which NewDay had a duty to record with the CRAs, 
and while I appreciate that the reason for Mr Cs difficulties is that he has been unwell and is 
stuck overseas, this doesnt mean that NewDay isnt still obliged to record accurate 
information about how he is managing his accounts. 
I accept this has been a difficult time for Mr C and he has my sympathies. However, I must 
review things objectively and have done so, I dont find NewDay has treated him unfairly. It 
follows this isnt a complaint I should uphold.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint. NewDay Ltd should now pay Mr C the £50 it has offered him if 
it has not already done so.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 November 2022.
