The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA failed to properly administer his 
account, allowing unauthorised transactions to be made which adversely affected his credit 
rating.
What happened
Mr B was plagued with calls from persons he believes were trying to gain access to his 
finances. He received calls over an extended period of time, with the callers purporting to be  
from various organisations including his bank and PayPal.
A recurring payment had been set up some months earlier and several payments had left Mr 
Bs account. There was then a larger payment made to the same merchant. PayPal were 
unable to collect that payment from Mr Bs bank account because the direct debit was 
cancelled.
This generated a negative balance on Mr Bs account which was left unpaid and eventually 
PayPal referred the debt to an external organisation to collect it on their behalf. Mr B notified 
PayPal that his account had been compromised by unknown persons whod set up this 
payment from his account. Mr B believed that the same people were able to prevent him 
from gaining access to his own account.
PayPal looked into what had happened and couldnt find any unauthorised access to Mr Bs 
account. Mr B made a complaint, believing that PayPal had adversely affected his credit 
rating because of the debt.
PayPal looked into what had happened and cancelled the debt on his own account which 
had been generated by the disputed transaction. PayPal later also refunded the other 
payments to the same merchant. They accepted that Mr B had received poor customer 
service but didnt think that his account had been compromised. PayPal also confirmed that 
they hadnt reported the original debt to the credit reference agencies because the debt 
wasnt linked to any credit. They also confirmed that Mr Bs credit account with them also 
hadnt generated any negative reporting. PayPal made an offer of £200 to compensate Mr B 
for his experiences. Mr B explained hed also incurred costs dealing with the complaint.
Mr B remained unhappy with how PayPal had dealt with his issue and how theyd treated 
him. He brought his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service for an independent 
review. It was looked into by one of our adjudicators who thought that PayPal hadnt 
provided good customer service, but thought their offer of £200 was appropriate. Mr B was 
unable to provide evidence of additional costs associated with his complaint, so no further 
award was made.
Mr B disagreed and wanted an increased amount of compensation, so his complaint has 
been passed to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im very aware that Ive summarised this complaint above in far less detail than Mr Bs own 
experiences may merit. No discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on what I 
think are the key issues here. Our rules allow me to do this. This simply reflects the informal 
nature of our service as a free alternative to the courts. If theres something Ive not 
mentioned, it isnt because Ive ignored it. I havent. Im satisfied I dont need to comment on 
every individual argument to be able to reach what I think is the right outcome. 
It's apparent that Mr B experienced a number of calls from unknown third parties who were 
trying to compromise his accounts. At one point a recurring payment was set up using his 
PayPal account to make the payment from his bank account. Four of these payments went 
unnoticed until a much larger payment was made.
The direct debit that settled the PayPal account was cancelled, which eventually led to the 
debt being sent to an external company to obtain the funds from Mr B. I think at this point, 
PayPal were under the impression that the payment was a genuine one set up by Mr B , 
mainly because the other earlier payments hadnt been disputed. So, it would appear to 
PayPal that the debt was a genuine one. I dont think it was unreasonable for PayPal to 
follow their processes for collecting outstanding debts at this point. Thats because they 
werent aware of the nature of the earlier payments.
The difficulties experienced by Mr B when he was trying to establish who was genuine and 
who was trying to scam him complicated the whole situation. I dont think PayPal were aware 
of the scammers causing Mr B difficulties. When Mr B was able to make his situation known 
to PayPal and they had an opportunity to look into it, they accepted the debt was the result 
of an unauthorised transaction and removed it from Mr Bs account. Mr B later highlighted 
the earlier payments to the same company and told PayPal they were also unauthorised. 
PayPal accepted this and refunded them to Mr B. I think this was the appropriate action for 
them to take and Im satisfied they acted reasonably once it became clear what had 
happened to Mr B
PayPal have confirmed that they didnt report the debt to the credit reference agencies 
because it wasnt related to any credit product. 
I appreciate Mr B had a difficult time with calls from scammers and Ive no doubt it was 
difficult for him to work out who was genuine and who was trying to obtain his details to 
scam him. But, I dont think that was something PayPal could have directly prevented as 
they werent aware it was happening at the time. 
The debt has been written off, refunds given, and no adverse reporting was made about the 
issue to the credit reference agencies. So, whilst I realise Mr B would like more 
compensation, I think PayPals offer of £200 was a reasonable one, particularly when a 
portion of the troubles experienced by Mr B was at the hands of others and not PayPal 
directly.
Putting things right
For PayPal to pay their original offer of £200 to settle this complaint. As there was no 
evidence of additional expenses incurred by Mr B, I havent considered any further award 
related to this.My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and instruct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA 
to pay Mr B £200.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 September 2022.
