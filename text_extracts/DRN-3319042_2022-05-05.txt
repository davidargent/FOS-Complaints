The complaint
Miss A complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA didnt refund her for an item, after 
she raised a claim under its Buyer Protection policy.
What happened
Miss A used her PayPal account to purchase a bracelet from a seller online. Miss A paid 
£1,000 for the item she says was advertised as being 18 carat gold, from a certain brand 
and was authentic. 
However, a couple of weeks after she received it, the bracelet started to rust. She contacted 
the seller, but they didnt respond. So, she opened a dispute with PayPal under its buyer 
protection policy, using the category significantly not as described.
PayPal closed the case in the sellers favour and Miss A asked our service to consider her 
complaint. 
Our investigator looked into Miss As concerns and thought her complaint should be upheld. 
He didnt think PayPal had done enough to investigate Miss As claim. He shared a report 
Miss A had sent us from an independent jeweller which suggested the bracelet was not 
authentic. He thought it would have been fair for PayPal to have requested an independent 
report as part of its investigation and should have concluded that the item she was sold was 
significantly not as described. Our investigator recommended PayPal reimburse her for the 
value of the item and add 8% simple interest from the date he believed she should have 
received the refund until the date the payment is made.
PayPal disagreed with our investigators view. It said that Miss A had the bracelet in her 
possession for some time and had admitted she had worn it. The damage to the clasp may 
have occurred while she was wearing it. It said it felt it was unlikely the she wouldnt have 
noticed it was damaged or unauthentic during the time she was wearing it. It also said it had 
no way of validating the report from the jeweller.
Miss A said she would like the ombudsman to consider extra compensation for the time 
PayPal had held her money and the stress and inconvenience shed experienced.
So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold Miss As complaint. Ill explain why.
PayPals user agreement says that buyers may be eligible for a refund under its Buyer 
Protection policy in certain circumstances, including where the item is Significantly Not as 
Described. The list of items which may be considered Significantly Not as Described 
includes: The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic (i.e. counterfeit)
Its not my role to make a finding about whether or not the bracelet Miss A purchased was 
Significantly Not as Described. My role is to decide if PayPal treated Miss A fairly. 
PayPal has referred to wording in its user agreement which says it will make a final decision 
(including automatically closing any dispute or claim), in its sole discretion. But that 
doesnt mean PayPal can do whatever it likes. It has to use its discretion fairly.
Miss A has provided a copy of the listing which shows the item was advertised as being 18 
carat gold, of a specific brand and authentic. Shes also provided screenshots of her the 
messages between her and PayPal, including photographs she sent to PayPal when she 
raised the dispute.
 
When she raised the dispute Miss A told PayPal that parts are rusting slightly which is 
supposed to be gold and hook for the clasp is not the same as the real bracelet. The hook 
available is also opened so bracelet falls off often. Its not authentic while has slight 
damages.
Miss A has also provided copies of the responses which she received from PayPal in 
relation to her claim. In one message it says it was refusing her claim because if an item is 
materially similar to the sellers description, we dont consider it to be significantly not as 
described. In other messages PayPal told Miss A that it was unable to determine whether 
the item was significantly different from how it was originally described because it had been 
altered while in Miss As possession.
Its unclear how PayPal reached the conclusion that Miss As bracelet had been altered. In 
its submissions to us PayPal said the case was closed in the sellers favour as the item had 
been worn / used and that damage could have been caused during the time Miss A was 
wearing it. 
From what Ive seen, I dont think PayPal properly considered Miss As dispute. I say this 
because I think Miss A made it clear from the outset that her concern was that the item 
wasnt authentic. She referred to the bracelet rusting, which would suggest the item wasnt 
18 carat gold as described. PayPal doesnt appear to have acknowledged or explored this 
concern. PayPal hasnt provided anything to show that it raised the dispute with the seller or 
that the seller disputed Miss As claim.
PayPal might not have been able to determine that the item wasnt authentic from the 
photographs Miss A provided. But if this was the case, I think it would have been reasonable 
for it to have asked Miss A for some further evidence to show the item wasnt genuine. 
At our investigators suggestion, Miss A took the bracelet to a jeweller and has provided a 
letter from them which says the bracelet does not test as 18ct gold with only a small amount 
of gold being detected, which would indicate the bracelet being gold plated.
PayPal says that it has no way of validating this letter. But the jewellers contact details are 
on the letter, so PayPal could have contacted the them directly if it had concerns about the 
letters validity.
On balance, I think that if PayPal had properly investigated Miss As dispute, it would likely 
have reached the conclusion that the bracelet wasnt authentic. This means it should likely 
have concluded that the item was Significantly Not as Described and granted a refund to 
Miss A.Miss A raised the dispute on 30 September 2021. PayPal rejected it around a week later. I 
think if it had requested an independent report at that time, it could likely have made a 
decision in Miss As favour and refunded her by around mid-October. So, I think it would be 
reasonable for it to pay her an additional 8% a year simple interest from then until the date it 
makes payment to settle this complaint to compensate her for the time shes been without 
these funds.
Ive considered Miss As request for additional compensation. I appreciate that it was 
frustrating for her when PayPal didnt accept her dispute. But I havent seen anything that 
makes me think that the impact of PayPals actions on Miss A went beyond the levels of 
frustration and annoyance that might reasonably be expected from a situation like this. And I 
think 8% statutory interest is a fair compensation for the length of time she was deprived of 
the funds.
Putting things right
PayPal should refund Miss A the £1,000 she paid for the bracelet and add 8% simple 
interest* a year from 15 October 2021 to the date of settlement.
HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal to deduct tax from this interest. PayPal should give Miss A 
a certificate showing how much tax its deducted if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Miss As complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA to put things right by doing as Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 June 2022.
