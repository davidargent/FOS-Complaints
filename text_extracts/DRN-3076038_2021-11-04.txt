The complaint
Ms M complains that NewDay Ltd reversed a chargeback credit without telling her that was a 
possibility.
What happened
Ms M says she asked NewDay on 10 August 2020 to raise a claim for hotel accommodation 
she was unable to use as her flights had been cancelled. She says she called NewDay on 
24 August 2020 and was told the money had been returned to her account and wasnt 
advised at any stage the merchant could challenge the process. Ms M says on 1 October 
2020 the payment was reversed which came as a shock to her and says she spent against 
the credit. She says NewDay shouldnt have credited her account until the dispute was 
sorted out and that she is now out of pocket by over £2,260. Ms M would like that money 
refunded and compensation for the stress she was caused and says this dispute was raised 
as a disputed transaction not a chargeback.
NewDay says it was instructed by Ms M to raise a chargeback which it did. It says Ms M 
signed a declaration on 11 August 2020 which made clear the refunded money could be 
reversed. NewDay says the merchant defended the chargeback and it followed the 
chargeback rules by reversing the credit. It says Ms M called it on 24 August 2020 and it told 
her the money had been returned to her account.
Ms M brought her complaint to us and our investigator upheld it in part. The investigator 
thought Ms M was told the merchant could dispute the chargeback and that any payment or 
credit could be reversed. But thought NewDay could have been clearer in the call on 24 
August 2020 and thought it could have been interpreted that the chargeback was successful 
and the process complete. The investigator recommended NewDay pay £75 compensation.
Ms M doesnt accept that view and in summary says she wasnt advised this was a 
chargeback and wasnt told it could be reversed. She maintains she was told she had been 
refunded the money which she then spent and that has resulted in a loss of the money.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision about this complaint and came to the provisional view that 
NewDay has dealt fairly with this complaint.
I explained that the chargeback rules were set not by NewDay but by the card providers. The 
chargeback scheme is voluntary with no guarantee of success. I made clear to Ms M that 
NewDay must follow the chargeback rules.
I was satisfied that NewDay tried to help Ms M with her dispute by raising a chargeback. I 
didnt think it matters that Ms M didnt realise it was a chargeback or thought it was a 
disputed transaction as both terms are often used to describe the same process. The key 
document here is the form that Ms M signed and ought to have read about the process. That 
document instructed NewDay to raise a dispute but made clear that Ms Ms account would 
be credited and that any credits could be reversed following evidence from the merchant. I 
was satisfied that information was prominently displayed and so I was also satisfied that Ms 
M was told that any credit to her account could be reversed. In those circumstances I didnt 
think NewDay misled Ms M or made a mistake by later reversing the credit.
I was satisfied that the merchant involved in this dispute defended the claim and provided 
evidence which meant Ms Ms claim didnt succeed. So, I was satisfied NewDay acted 
appropriately by reversing the credit in October 2020.
I listened carefully to the telephone call between the parties on 24 August 2020. I 
appreciated what that investigator says that its open to interpretation. But I was satisfied it 
was a relatively short call in which Ms M asked had it gone through? to which NewDay said 
yes and the call was ended by Ms M. I didnt think NewDay had an opportunity to clarify 
matters in those circumstances and I didnt think it could have known that Ms M took that to 
mean the chargeback itself was successful and resolved. I also thought that Ms M ought 
reasonably to have been aware from the signed declaration that she would receive a credit 
in her account, but any chargeback could be defended. I didnt think it realistic to think any 
dispute could have been completely resolved in a matter of days from 11 August 2020. And I 
thought it unfair to find that NewDay ought to have been clearer when the call was ended by 
Ms M.
I appreciated Ms M says NewDay shouldnt have credited her account until the dispute was 
completely resolved. But I hoped Ms M appreciats that NewDay doesnt have a discretion in 
such matters and must follow the chargeback rules.
I also appreciated Ms M says she has lost over £2,260 as a result of NewDays actions. I 
couldnt see why Ms M says that and I hoped she would explain that further before my final 
decision. I explained that I cant fairly hold NewDay responsible for the outcome of the 
chargeback and so I thought Ms M would have lost that money in any event. I also thought 
that Ms M spent the credit but had the benefit of that spending in receiving goods and 
services.
Overall my provisional view was that NewDay made clear at the start of this dispute that Ms 
Ms account would be credited, and that credit was subject to reversal. And that I didnt think 
NewDay duing the telephone call could have known that Ms M thought the chargeback had 
ended. I also didnt think Ms M asked if the process was ended and I would have reasonably 
expected her to have asked that question in the circumstances.
Ms M has replied in detail to my provisional view and in summary doesnt accept it. She says 
NewDay didnt provide her with a copy of the chargeback rules or information about the 
process or steps involved. She says the call length has no relevance here and maintains that 
she wouldnt have spent the money if she knew it may be debited.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the same overall view that I reached in my provisional 
decision and for the same reasons. I dont propose to answer each of Ms Ms points as Im 
satisfied that my provisional decision does answer those points and provides the reasons for 
my decision.
I have made clear that the key document here is the letter NewDay sent to Ms M and in 
which made clear that any account credit may be reversed. So, I dont think its correct to 
say NewDay didnt provide Ms M with any information about the chargeback process. And I think that if Ms M wished to have a copy of the chargeback rules then should could have 
asked for them or obtained a copy online. I would not expect NewDay to provide a copy of 
the rules in these circumstances. Im also satisfied that I have made clear that I think Ms M 
did not suffer a financial loss and received the benefit of her spending.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2021.
