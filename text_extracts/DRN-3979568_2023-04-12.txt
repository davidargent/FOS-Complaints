The complaint
Mr C is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc hasnt been able to offer him a 
mortgage. Mr C believes this is due to an error in NatWests systems that causes him to fail 
its credit scoring. 
To settle the complaint Mr C wants NatWest to correct the error so his application can 
proceed.
What happened
I will summarise the complaint in less detail than its been presented. There are several 
reasons for this. First of all, the history of the matter is set out in detail in correspondence, so 
there is no need for me to repeat the details here. I will instead concentrate on giving the 
reasons for my decision. In addition, our decisions are published, so its important I dont 
include any information that might lead to M C being identified. So for these reasons, I will 
keep my summary of what happened quite brief.
This complaint has been evolving in real time, as NatWest has tried to resolve the problem 
Mr C has encountered with his credit file whilst the complaint has been with us. 
Briefly, Mr C applied for a buy-to-let mortgage with NatWest, but the application was refused, 
due to credit scoring. Mr C was unable to access his credit score on the NatWest banking 
app and so couldnt identify where there might be an issue. 
Although Mr C had previously been involved in a failed business that had banked with 
NatWest, the bank wasnt able to find any historic markers on Mr Cs credit file relating to 
this. There didnt appear to be any issues with his personal banking history, as far as the 
bank was concerned.
NatWest wasnt able to resolve the problem, so Mr C brought it to our service. An 
investigator looked at what had happened, and asked NatWest to check the information it 
held for Mr C and to make sure this was accurate. She also asked NatWest to offer to 
consider another application from Mr C and explain how he could do this. The investigator 
also asked NatWest to pay Mr C £100 for distress and inconvenience.
NatWest explained that the information on its banking app about Mr Cs credit score came 
from TransUnion, one of the credit reference agencies, rather than NatWest itself. The bank 
had previously noted that there might need to be a space inserted into part of Mr Cs 
address. NatWest had made the alteration to the address, and this had allowed Mr C to 
access the banking app. NatWest also agreed to pay the £100 compensation.
However, Mr C was still reporting a problem, because he said that, although his wife was 
receiving text messages about their joint account, he was not. Mr C said that hed been told 
by someone within the bank that the problem might relate to a past cancelled account. 
NatWest wasnt able to establish whether or not this might be the issue. 
Mr C also said that he thought he might possibly have been linked to another customer with 
the same name living in the same locality.
Mr C asked for an ombudsman to review the matter. He doesnt think £100 compensation is 
adequate, particularly as the fees on his account are £372 per year. Mr C thinks the bank 
should discount the fees on his account until the bank is able to offer him the full range of 
services linked to the account.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr C has told us that hes raised a new complaint about his wife receiving texts and emails 
for their joint banking, but that he has not received any texts, so I wont comment on that 
here. 
The crux of this complaint is that NatWest hasnt been able to establish why there is an issue 
with Mr Cs credit score, particularly given his account conduct and investments with the 
bank. 
NatWest has explained that the information about Mr Cs credit score comes from 
TransUnion, a third party credit reference agency. Mr C says there is no issue with his 
finances, and so cant understand why hes failed NatWests credit scoring. 
I appreciate its frustrating for Mr C that NatWest hasnt been able to identify why there might 
be an issue with his credit score. Ive not seen a copy of Mr Cs full credit file, as this is 
something only he has access to. I cant say, therefore, whether there might be information 
recorded on it by another business that might have affected his credit score, or whether Mr C 
has been incorrectly linked to another party. 
It might help Mr C to obtain a copy of his full credit report from the credit reference agencies 
to see if there is anything on it that might provide him with some clarity as to why his 
application with the bank failed. Information recorded by other creditors would not, of course, 
be something for which NatWest could be held responsible.
Putting things right
Overall, in the context of what NatWest has done, I think the bank has done its best to try to 
resolve the matter. I think the £100 compensation offered by the bank is fair and reasonable 
in all the circumstances and I dont think the bank needs to do anything more.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must pay Mr C £100 compensation 
in full and final settlement of this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 May 2023.
