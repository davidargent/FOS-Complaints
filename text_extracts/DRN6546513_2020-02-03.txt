Mr D complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  irresponsibly  
lent to him. 
background
Mr D took out 12 loans with Sunny between November 2016  and January  2018.  His 
borrowing history is as follows:

There is an outstanding  balance on loans 9 to 12. 
In its response to Mr Ds complaint, Sunny accepted  that it shouldnt have lent loans 11 and 
12. Mr D didnt agree with how Sunny  intended to resolve the matter and he complained  to 
this service. Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be upheld in respect  of loans  4 to 
12. 
Sunny didnt agree with that view. It reiterated the checks it had undertaken and that it had 
taken account  of Mr Ds other repayment commitments before deciding  whether to lend to 
him. It loans  appeared affordable and the repayments  within  his declared  monthly  income. It 
did not accept  that it had lent irresponsibly. 
As the parties are not in agreement with our adjudicator, the matter has been  passed to me 
to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr D could  
Ref: DRN65465132repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint.
As I said above, early  in the lending relationship, Sunny  was entitled to rely on the 
information that Mr D provided to it. I can see that for loans 1 to 3, Mr D declared his monthly 
income to be over £2,600 and his disposable  income to be considerably less than that. 
Taking account of the information  Sunny had at that time, it reasonably  concluded that Mr 
Ds repayments would have been  sustainably affordable. 
However, I think Sunny should have done  more before it decided  to lend loan 4 to Mr D. I 
say this because  this was the fourth  loan Mr D had borrowed in less than three months. If 
agreed, he would  have  borrowed £1,000 in that time. Hed applied  for £100, which was the 
same amount as the initial loan. It looks as though that loan could have been taken out just 
before he was due to make repayments for loans 1 and 2. That should have raised 
questions with Sunny as to whether Mr D was using loan 4 to repay at least  loans 1 and 2. 
Ref: DRN65465133Similarly, for loan 5, I can see Mr D borrowed a further £250 shortly  after repaying  loans  2 
and 3. I think this should  have put Sunny on notice that he was borrowing to plug a hole in 
his finances caused by those loan repayments.  It should have  undertaken further checks. 
I think a proportionate check for loans 4 and 5 should  have  involved a full review  of Mr Ds 
financial circumstances. Had that review been undertaken, I think Sunny would have seen 
that he was making  significant monthly  repayments  towards high cost short-term lending 
commitments with numerous other lenders.  Upon  full consideration of his finances, I think 
Sunny would have  seen  that Mr D could not sustainably repay loans 4 and 5.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr D with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which it should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. If that point  was reached,  Sunny should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. . 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ds case, I agree with our adjudicator  that this point 
was reached by loan 6. By now, Sunny ought to have realised that Mr D was not sustainably 
repaying his loans. Loan 6 was for £50 and came one week  after hed borrowed £250. I can 
see that Mr D had taken  out this borrowing  less than a month after repaying two loans the 
month before.  So it was most likely that Mr D was borrowing further to cover the hole 
repaying those loans had on his finances. Sunny should have appreciated that his 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. His borrowing was not to meet  a temporary  
shortfall in his income, but to meet an ongoing need.  
I think that Mr D lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans on Mr Ds ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 4 and 5 and loans 6 to 12. Sunny must take 
action to put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr D loans 4 to 12. 
As I said above, there is an outstanding  balance  on loans 9 to 12. If Sunny has sold the 
outstanding debts, it must buy them  back if it is able to do so. If it is not able to buy the debts 
back, it must  liaise with the new debt owner  to achieve the results outlined  below:
a)Sunny  must add together  the total of the repayments made by Mr D towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, 
not including  anything it was already refunded; 
b)It must  calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr D 
which were considered as part of paragraph  (a) calculated from the date Mr D 
originally made  the payments to the date the complaint is settled; 
c)Sunny  must remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any 
upheld outstanding loans. It must treat any repayments made by Mr D as though 
Ref: DRN65465134they had been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  
in Mr D having made overpayments,  Sunny must  refund those overpayments with 
8% simple  interest* calculated on the overpayments from the date they would 
have arisen to the date the complaint is settled. It must then calculate  the 
amounts calculated in paragraphs (a) and (b) and move to paragraph (e). 
d)If there  is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts  calculated  in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) should be used to repay any balance remaining on the outstanding 
loans. If this results in a surplus, the surplus  should  be paid to Mr D. However, if 
there is still an outstanding balance, Sunny should try to agree an affordable  
repayment plan with Mr D. It must  not pursue an outstanding balance of principal  
it has already written off. 
e)The overall pattern  of Mr Ds borrowing for loans 6 to 12 means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse. Sunny should  remove these loans entirely from 
Mr Ds credit file. It does not have to remove loans  6 to 12 until they have been 
repaid, but it must still remove any adverse information recorded  about them.  
.*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. It should give 
Mr D a certificate showing how much  tax has been  deducted, if he asks for one. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ds complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr D compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 March 2020.
