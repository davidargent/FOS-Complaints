The complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) delayed the transfer of his 
jointly held portfolio into his wifes sole name, preventing the transfer from being completed.
 
What happened
Mr A is represented in his complaint by a company who Ill refer to as A throughout my 
decision.
Mr A and Mrs C held a joint investment portfolio which consisted of two individual ISAs and 
jointly held shares. Sadly, Mrs C became terminally ill and on 27 January 2020 Mr As 
representative, A, wrote to NatWest asking to transfer the joint portfolio into Mrs Cs sole 
name.
NatWest received this instruction on 31 January 2020 and called to confirm receipt on          
4 February. It explained itd send the relevant forms needed and did so the next day. The 
forms were received by Mr A and Mrs C on 7 February 2020. A called NatWest on              
10 February 2020 to ask for copies to be sent directly by email and again on 11 February to 
ask how best to complete the forms. The NatWest staff member felt the request wasnt 
possible due to the issue of ISAs being held within the portfolio. 
The NatWest advisor sought further advice on how best to proceed and confirmed on         
13 February 2020 that the instruction would have to be modified to include specific wording 
that enabled Mr As ISA to remain in place. A were told to ask for all but £1 of the jointly held 
portfolio to be transferred to Mrs C and for the remaining £1 to be transferred to a new 
portfolio along with Mr As ISA.
NatWest received the forms from A on 18 February 2020 and responded on                        
28 February 2020, explaining the forms received werent enough to complete the newly 
modified request. Further forms were then sent and received, but sadly Mrs C passed away 
on 2 March 2020 before the transfer could be completed. 
A have said they discussed the matter with a manager at NatWest on 2 March 2020 who 
admitted NatWest had made an error, A provided their own call notes to show this. NatWest 
were unable to locate any records of this conversation taking place, and so didnt provide 
any comment when requested.
A complained on Mr As behalf. They felt NatWests communication confused matters and 
ultimately prevented the transfer from taking place in time. They asked for NatWest to cover 
any losses Mr A may incur in the future due to the failure to secure the capital gains 
protection the transfer wouldve afforded.
NatWest didnt accept itd made any errors. It felt that as the instruction changed from the 
original request different forms needed to be completed, which meant more time had to be 
taken. It didnt feel it was responsible for any unnecessary delays.
A referred the complaint to our service on Mr As behalf. Our Investigator thought NatWest 
had provided the incorrect information in the call and email on 13 February 2020, but that 
they still couldnt say the transfer wouldve completed in time even if this mistake had not 
happened. This was because they felt that if everything had gone correctly there still 
wouldnt have been enough time for the transfer to complete within NatWests standard 
timescales of up to 15 working days.
Mr A disagreed, he felt the original request made in January was sufficient for what was a 
simple transfer and that NatWest had confused matters. He felt that the call that took place 
between A and a NatWest employee on 2 March 2020 should have further consideration as 
he felt it acknowledged that NatWest had delayed things. He asked for an ombudsman to 
review the complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Considering both accounts of what happened along with written communications, call 
recordings and system notes Im satisfied that NatWest acted on the first request in January 
within a reasonable period  getting in touch promptly on 4 February 2020.
Ive looked at the original request submitted by A in late January 2020. I cant agree that it 
was enough on its own to enable NatWest to complete the transfer  it simply doesnt 
contain the details required. But I do think it shouldve been enough to prompt NatWest to 
question what exactly Mr A was trying to achieve, instead of just sending standard transfer 
forms which would later prove insufficient. If this conversation was had on 4 February 2020, 
the mistakes made on 13 February 2020 (recommending a modification of the request 
without providing the complete set of instructions and forms) couldve been avoided.
NatWest were aware the portfolio contained ISAs when they received the original instruction 
 and so shouldve made further contact to clarify what Mr As objectives were. I think its 
reasonable to say that NatWest shouldve provided all the forms needed to complete the 
transfer at this point.
If the correct instructions were sent on 5 February 2020, Im satisfied the submission 
NatWest then received wouldve most likely contained the information it required, and the 
transfer process couldve begun without any further delays. I say this because A and Mr A 
provided everything NatWest required when it was later requested.
So, I agree with our Investigator that NatWest has made a mistake which ultimately delayed 
matters. The question now is what financial loss, if any, this has caused. To investigate this 
further I must consider what wouldve happened if this mistake hadnt occurred  and A had 
submitted everything NatWest required with their second instruction.
Putting things right
Mr A believes the transfer wouldve completed before Mrs C passed away, were it not for 
NatWests errors. But Im not satisfied this is the case. Mr A notes that his original instruction 
was sent on 27 January 2020. But as Ive already explained this original instruction wasnt 
enough. Even if everything had gone correctly, Im satisfied it wouldnt have been until        
15 February 2020 at the earliest that NatWest received the forms needed to start the 
process. I would however like to explain in detail how Ive reached this conclusion.NatWest confirmed the standard timescale for typical transfers is up to 15 working days, but 
that more complex transfers can take up to 30 working days. Upon review NatWest felt this 
transfer was a complex one. When prompted, the reason it provided to justify the complexity 
was the fact that the request changed. Im satisfied this change in approach was suggested 
by NatWest itself, and wouldnt have been an issue if the transfer request was clarified when 
originally received. I dont think itd be fair to apply the 30 working days timescale in this 
instance based on the reason provided.
My expectation then would be for the transfer to complete within the standard timescale of 
up to 15 working days, from the point A submitted the completed forms. This means in order 
to have most likely completed the transfer in time before Mrs Cs passing, the instructions 
and forms wouldve needed to have been received by NatWest on 10 February 2020 at the 
latest. 
If NatWest had clarified the nature of the transfer in the call on 4 February 2020, Im satisfied 
the correct forms wouldve been sent at the earliest on 5 February 2020 and received on the 
7 February 2020. There is some dispute over why the forms were sent originally to Mr A 
instead of to A  but even if I assume that NatWest wouldve sent the forms directly to A had 
everything gone correctly, it still would not leave enough time.
This is because once the forms were received by A it took eight days for NatWest to receive 
the completed and signed copies. Im satisfied if everything had gone correctly it wouldve 
still taken the same length of time as it did originally to return the forms, and Ive seen no 
evidence to suggest otherwise. I appreciate there was a period of two days within this time 
which NatWest took to answer a query for A. But I dont believe this was an unreasonably 
long period taken to answer the query, or that removing these days altogether would impact 
the outcome of the transfer. And so, the earliest I think its likely NatWest wouldve received 
the completed forms would be 15 February 2020. Sadly, still too late to make a difference to 
the completion of the transfer, as the 15 working days timescale wouldve finished on           
6 March 2020.
I appreciate Mr A may feel that because the timescale was up to 15 working days it would be 
unfair to work on the assumption that it wouldnt have completed any sooner. I accept its 
possible NatWest may have completed the transfer sooner, but Im not persuaded that the 
standard timescale of 15 working days is unreasonably long. And I dont feel it would be fair 
in the circumstances of this case to hold NatWest responsible for completing the transfer any 
earlier than their standard timescales suggested it could take.
Im also satisfied that the conversation on 2 March 2020 with NatWest management and A 
did take place, and that the call notes A provided are likely an accurate representation of the 
conversation. However, this call doesnt impact the outcome of my decision  I already agree 
that NatWest made mistakes which caused delays, and Ive explained in detail what impact I 
believe these mistakes have had.
In short, even if everything had gone correctly, I cant say that the transfer wouldve most 
likely completed in time. So, it wouldnt be fair for me to ask NatWest to cover any perceived 
shortfall from the transfer failing to complete.
Trouble and Upset
When awarding compensation, Ive had to consider that the complaint is Mr As, not his 
representatives. When considering NatWests actions, I can only investigate what impact 
those actions have had on Mr A. I cant consider any inconvenience NatWest may have 
caused his representative.To award any compensation Id need to be satisfied the impact of NatWests error was 
greater than just a minor inconvenience or upset. And its clear that this is the case  poor 
communication on NatWests part meant Mr A was understandably upset to find out A had 
not been fully informed of the correct requirements on 13 February 2020 or earlier. This 
mustve been particularly frustrating after A had asked for clarification on the next steps. 
Believing hed submitted everything NatWest needed to secure the transfer, it must have 
been upsetting to later find out this wasnt the case during an already time sensitive and 
emotional circumstance.
But it wouldnt be fair to hold NatWest responsible for the upset that was caused by the 
transfer failing to complete  because as explained I think this most likely wouldve 
happened regardless of NatWests mistakes. So, I think in the circumstances the £100 
already recommended is fair compensation for the trouble and upset caused by NatWests 
failure to provide correct instructions.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr A 
£100 for the trouble and upset it caused.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2021.
