K820x#14complaint
Mr M is unhappy  with the way NewDay Ltd has administered his credit  card accounts. Hes 
unhappy that it didnt help him when he was in financial  difficulty.  Mr M says this has led to a 
county court judgement (CCJ) being registered against him. He wants  this removed. Mr M 
also wants interest and charges to be refunded and any outstanding balance to be wiped off. 
background
Mr M had credit card accounts with NewDay. These  were branded as a Marbles  credit card 
and an Aqua credit card. The Marbles account  was opened in September 2015. The Aqua  
account was opened a few months later at the start of 2016. 
By October  2016,  Mr M was having difficulty with his finances.  He spoke to NewDay about 
both credit cards on 22 October. It agreed  to set up payment plans on both accounts  and to 
reduce the interest rate. 
In the summer  of the following year, NewDay sold both these credit card accounts  to another 
business that Ill refer to as C. The accounts were  defaulted by C in August 2018. It seems a 
CCJ was registered  for the Aqua account in January 2019.  Again, this was done  by C. 
When Mr M complained to NewDay, it rejected his complaint. It told him that his accounts 
had been sold to C in line with the account  terms and conditions.  
Mr M then brought his complaint  to our service.  One of our investigators looked into his 
case. She didnt think it should be upheld. In summary, she said NewDay had written to 
Mr M telling him his accounts were being sold to C. The investigator also said the adverse 
information on Mr Ms credit file had been recorded  by C, not NewDay. 
The investigator also said NewDay  had told us that its final response  letter  contained 
incorrect information. She passed on NewDays apologies for this to Mr M. 
Mr M didnt  agree with the investigators findings. He asked for his complaint to be passed to 
an ombudsman for a final decision.  Our investigator  then told Mr M that NewDay had offered 
to pay him £30 for the incorrect  information  hed been given in its final response letter.  
The investigator asked  Mr M if he wanted to accept this offer. She gave him seven days to 
respond. But as we havent anything more from Mr M, his file is with me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive decided not to 
uphold it. Ill explain why. 
First, Im aware  that Mr M has also made a complaint  about  the actions of C. Weve dealt 
with this completely  separately and I wont be commenting any further  on that complaint. My 
decision deals solely with the actions of New Day. 
Mr Ms credit card accounts  were  originally with NewDay. In October 2016, when he said he 
was struggling to make his payments, NewDay  was required  to treat him positively and 
Ref: DRN58031002sympathetically. It agreed lower payments, reduced the interest  rate on his accounts and 
charges were suspended. 
So Im satisfied NewDay did treat him positively and sympathetically. I think  it actions  in 
reducing the payments and interest,  and freezing the charges, was fair and reasonable. I 
dont think NewDay did anything wrong  when it took this action.  
In 2017, NewDay  transferred  both of Mr Ms accounts to C. I can see that the terms and 
conditions of both the Aqua and Marbles accounts allow NewDay  to do this. I can also see 
that NewDay sent letters Mr M during 2017on both accounts. 
Ive looked at these letters. They clearly set out that his accounts are being transferred to C. 
Both letters are correctly addressed to where  Mr M has told us he was living during that time. 
I note that Mr M told our investigator that he cant remember  if he received these letters.  But 
as I can see these were sent to him at his correct address, Im satisfied NewDay  acted 
correctly and didnt  do anything wrong when  it transferred Mr Ms accounts to C. 
NewDays responsibility for the administration of Mr Ms accounts ended  when  they were  
transferred to C in 2017. But I can see that Mr Ms accounts werent defaulted until 2018. 
The CCJ wasnt registered  until 2019. This was all after NewDay  was no longer responsible 
for these  accounts. So I cant, and dont hold it responsible for the adverse information being 
registered against Mr M. 
Finally, Ill deal with the incorrect information contained in NewDays final response  to Mr Ms 
complaint. In it, NewDay told him that when it agreed the payment plan on the Marbles  
account and froze the charges, it also suspended the interest. This wasnt  accurate. The 
interest was reduced, not suspended. We passed  on NewDays apologies to Mr M along  
with its offer of £30 for this mistake.  
Im satisfied this was a pure administrative error  when responding to Mr Ms complaint  in 
2019. It in no way affected  how NewDay ran his account or the interest  that was charged  on 
it. It was simply  a case of the final response not accurately reflecting what  action was 
agreed, and taken, back in 2016.  For this reason,  I think NewDays  apology and offer of £30 
is fair and reasonable. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this compliant, in the sense that Im not asking 
NewDay Ltd to do, or pay, more  than the £30 its already offered. Ill leave it for Mr M to 
decide if he wants to accept that offer in full and final settlement of this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 March  2020.
