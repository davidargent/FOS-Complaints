The complaint
Company U is unhappy with how National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) dealt with an 
application for a Bounce Back Loan.
What happened
Company U applied to NatWest for a Bounce Back Loan, a government supported initiative 
for small and medium-sized businesses. NatWest considered the application and declined it. 
But NatWest then contacted Company U  and offered the Bounce Back Loan.
A few days later NatWest told Company U the loan had been offered in error, and they 
cancelled the loan. Company U then obtained a Bounce Back Loan from a different provider.
Company U have complained about how NatWest dealt with the loan application. It said that 
itd accepted the original decline decision, and considered the matter closed at that point. 
But NatWest then offering the loan, and then cancelling it, caused confusion. NatWest 
offered Company U £400 compensation for the error, but this hasnt been accepted. And 
Company U have brought the complaint to us for investigation.
Our investigator said that, given the unprecedented times that caused the government to 
launch this initiative, and the short timescale in which products like this have been 
introduced, some teething problems are to be expected. He said that NatWest made an error 
when they granted the loan, but they realised this error and took steps to put this right by 
cancelling the loan. He thought this was reasonable and, in the circumstances, he didnt 
think that NatWest needed to do anything more.
Company U didnt agree with the investigator. The directors have said NatWest offered the 
loan, they signed the loan agreement, and planned to purchase new equipment as a result. 
Because of this, they dont feel £400 is fair, and they think that £1,600 is more reasonable in 
the circumstances. So theyve asked for an ombudsman to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed the evidence I agree with the investigators findings on this complaint for 
broadly the same reasons. If I havent commented on any specific point, its because I dont 
believe its affected what I think is the right outcome.
The basic facts of this case arent in dispute. In May 2020 Company U applied to NatWest 
for a Bounce Back Loan, and NatWest initially declined this. Then NatWest offered the loan. 
Which they then cancelled because itd been offered in error.
Given these facts, Im in agreement that NatWest couldve done better. But I dont think 
NatWests error has had a financial impact on Company U. The Bounce Back Loan was 
applied for to purchase new equipment. And Company U were able to fund this purchase 
through a Bounce Back Loan, albeit with another lender.
So Company U hasnt been left having to purchase equipment it didnt have the money for, 
nor has it taken delivery and installed equipment that its now had to uninstall and return. So 
theres been no financial loss. Company U is in exactly the same position it intended  it has 
new equipment funded by a Bounce Back Loan. And as all Bounce Back Loans are 
guaranteed by the government, the terms are exactly the same, regardless of which lender 
supplied the funding.
I appreciate that the directors of Company U have found this to be a frustrating experience. 
And the need to find another lender wouldve been stressful to them. But the loan was 
offered to Company U in error, and not to the directors in a personal capacity. 
Company U is a business, so it cant suffer any distress or upset. It can suffer inconvenience 
but, as Ive already said, given that it was able to fund the purchase of the new equipment on 
a loan with exactly the same terms as NatWest were offering, it didnt in this instance. So I 
dont think NatWest needs to do anything more to resolve this matter.
Its now up to the directors of Company U to decide whether to accept the £400 offered by 
NatWest or not.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I dont uphold Company Us complaint about National 
Westminster Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask U to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 September 2020.
