K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains that Evergreen Finance London  Limited (trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk) didnt 
carry out appropriate checks before lending him money.
background
Mr G had a £400  loan from MoneyBoat on 15 April 2018. It was due to be repaid with four 
instalments of £158.90, but Mr G made  no payments towards the loan.
Mr G says if MoneyBoat had done better checks it would have realised the repayments  were 
unaffordable to him. He says he had been  in debt since 2017 and the stress of the loans has 
caused him to suffer with depression.
MoneyBoat says it was satisfied  with the results  of its credit check  and verified  the income 
figure Mr G provided. It says based on that, and the expenditure figures Mr G also provided, 
he had sufficient disposable income to afford  the repayments. MoneyBoat  adds that it 
significantly increased Mr Gs declared expenditure based on information from his credit 
report, but the repayments remained affordable. However, as a gesture of goodwill, 
MoneyBoat offered to waive half of the interest and charges on the loan as it acknowledged  
Mr G was now experiencing financial hardship.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He says MoneyBoats  credit 
check showed Mr G already had a number of other short-term loans so it should  have  
realised he would be unable to sustainably repay another loan. He recommended that 
interest and charges should be waived on the loan and that any adverse information about it 
should be removed  from his credit file.
MoneyBoat responded to say that its checks were proportionate to the circumstances of the 
loan. It acknowledged  that it had information about  Mr Gs other short-term loans but it says 
it was not obliged to review  every line of a credit  file in the early stages of lending  decisions.
my findings
Ive considered all available  evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint. MoneyBoat was required  to lend responsibly. It should 
have made  checks to make sure Mr G could afford  to repay  the loan before it lent to him. 
Those checks needed to be proportionate to things such as the amount Mr G was borrowing, 
and his lending  history. But there was no set list of checks  MoneyBoat  had to do.
Im satisfied that the checks  MoneyBoat  carried out were proportionate to the circumstances 
of the loan. But, as MoneyBoat explained,  those  checks showed Mr G had significantly  
understated his expenditure  based  on what his credit file showed. I accept MoneyBoat  
increased his expenditure by £720 because of this and the loan repayments still appeared to 
be affordable, but this did not take into account the full picture revealed in the credit file. I say 
this because the credit record  obtained by MoneyBoat showed:
16 active loan accounts, including a car loan and short-term loans;
oThe regular payments on those accounts totalled  around  £2,400
A further  three credit  card and mail order accounts with a balance of £1,200;
At least eight outstanding short-term loan accounts;
21 active accounts and 26 accounts opened  within the last six months.
Ref: DRN97989422So I find the repayments on the MoneyBoat loan were not affordable  to Mr G and that 
MoneyBoat should have  seen that from his credit  file. I accept MoneyBoat says it does not 
expect its underwriters to go through every line of a credit file for a consumers first loan,  but 
I dont consider that was required here.  The number of active  accounts and the number of 
short-term loans themselves are clear indicators that Mr G was already struggling to manage  
his money. Indeed, as Mr Gs declared income  was £1,730, he clearly could not afford to 
make his repayments on his existing debt,  so it was irresponsible for MoneyBoat to approve 
a further loan.
Therefore I uphold Mr Gs complaint about  the loan and MoneyBoat should write-off the 
interest. It is also obliged to respond positively and sympathetically if Mr G wishes to contact 
it to discuss a repayment plan for the outstanding balance.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Evergreen Finance London Limited  (trading as 
MoneyBoat.co.uk) should:
Write  off all interest and charges on the loan;
Remove any negative  information about the loan from Mr Gs credit  file.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 March  2020.
