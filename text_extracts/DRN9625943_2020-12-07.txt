K821x#15complaint
Mr N has complained about loans taken with Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 
Money. Mr N says he couldnt afford the loans and his credit file would have shown  he 
was in debt.
background
I issued a provisional decision on 30 October  2020  where I set out a detailed background to 
this complaint. My provisional decision is attached at the end of this final decision and forms 
part of my final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  to both parties that I was inclined to reach  different 
conclusions to the adjudicator and gave both parties  the opportunity to provide further 
comments.
The deadline  for response has now passed. Mr N responded saying he agreed with my 
provisional decision and had nothing further to add. 118 118 Money didnt respond.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has provided any evidence or information to change  the conclusions  
reached in my provisional decision, I see no reason to depart from those conclusions.  
I dont think Mr N could afford the loan and 118 118 Money shouldnt have lent to him.
To put things right for Mr N, 118 118 Money  should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loan 2; and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the 
date they were paid,  if they were, to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ns credit  file as a result of the 
interest and charges  on this loan.
HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must  give Mr N a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ns complaint  and direct Madison CF UK Limited to put things right as set out 
above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 January 2021.

When Mr N complained to 118 118 Money, it didnt uphold his complaint,  118 118 Money said it 
responsibly lent to Mr N. Unhappy with 118 118 Moneys response, Mr N complained to this 
service.
One of our adjudicators  looked  at the complaint  and didnt  uphold any part of Mr Ns complaint. Our 
adjudicator thought that 118 118 Money did enough  checks  before lending  loan 1 and although it 
should have done more  before lending loan, she thought that enough check would likely  have shown 
Mr N was able to afford the loan.
Mr N disagreed, he said he was spending most of his income on repaying  other debts and so he 
couldnt afford  the loans.
As the complaint wasnt  resolved, its been passed to me, an ombudsman to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant  regulatory  
rules and good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
Before lending  money  to a consumer,  a lender  should take proportionate steps to 
understand whether  the consumer will be able to repay  what theyre  borrowing  in a 
sustainable manner  without it adversely  impacting on their financial situation.
A lender  should gather  enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on the 
lending. Although the guidance and rules  themselves didnt set out compulsory checks, they did list a 
number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing to lend. The key thing was that 
any checks needed to be proportionate and had to take into account  a number of different things,  
including things such as how much was being lent and when what was being borrowed was due to 
be repaid.
118 118 Money  says it searched Mr Ns credit file and asked  Mr N about  his monthly  income and 
expenses. Mr Ns credit search showed that he had one default from 2010 but there was nothing  
else of concern on the credit  file. This default from 2010 was around 5 years before this loan and I 
agree with the adjudicator that this default on its own didnt necessarily mean  that Mr N would 
struggle to repay or that 118 118 Money should have taken its checks  further. 
118 118 Moneys checks on Mr Ns income and expenses show that Mr N declared his income as 
£3,010 and his monthly expenses including  credit  card commitment  was £1,235. Based on what  it 
saw from this it thought it reasonable to lend to Mr N as a result.
Ref: DRN96259433Looking at the term of the loan and the monthly repayments compared  to Mr Ns monthly income, I 
think 118 118 Moneys checks went far enough. Those checks show that Mr N was left with enough 
disposable income  to repay the loan over the term. And so, I agree  with the adjudicator that 118 118 
Money did enough before  lending loan 1.
Turning to loan 2, Mr N borrowed this loan within two weeks  of repaying  the first loan. Loan 2 was for 
a higher amount  and a longer term. I can also see from the credit file that Mr N had one default within 
the last 12 months and his credit balance to limit ratio was 96%, and so he was close to the limit of 
his credit facility.  I think  in the circumstances;  118 118 Money should  have been looking  to get a 
thorough understanding of Mr Ns financial circumstances before lending to him. I think it should 
have been looking  to verify some  of the information Mr N provided.
Mr N has provided copies  of his bank statements from around  the time of this loan and from what  I 
can see, his income was around £2,741 in the month  before loan 2 was approved.
Mr Ns normal living costs were around £1,735, this included things  like his rent, food,  utilities and 
council tax. I can also see that Mr N was borrowing from a number of other lenders. Mr N was 
repaying at least two credit  cards and was also repaying  around seven other lenders including 
short term lenders. In the month before this loan, Mr N paid around £2,610, close to 100%  of his 
income.
From what Ive seen, this was a pattern  that continued as Mr N continued repaying these creditors 
while he was also repaying loan 2 with 118 118 Money. And has around the time loan 2 was 
approved, Mr N had around £860 outstanding to short term lenders.
This wasnt a sustainable position and had 118 118 Money carried out enough  checks, its likely to 
have found that Mr N would struggle to repay the loan and as a responsible  lender shouldnt  have 
lent him this loan. And so, 118 118 Money needs  to put things right for loan 2.
