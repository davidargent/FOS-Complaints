Miss B complains  that MYJAR Limited  was irresponsible to lend to her.
background
Miss B had seven loans  from Myjar between May 2016 and October 2017 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Monthly

1 19 May 2016 £100 27d £121.60 15 Jun 2015 On time

5 17 Aug 2017 £400 182d £119.43 15 Feb 2018 25 Aug 2017
6 30 Aug 2017 £400 380d £63.72 14 Sep 2018 18 Sep 2017
7 2 Oct 2017 £450 378d £71.11 15 Oct 2018 Outstanding
Miss B says she had a very low disposable  income and other outstanding debts when  she 
applied to Myjar for the loans. She says Myjar did not properly assess  the affordability of the 
loans and she became stuck  in a cycle of borrowing.  Miss B adds that her financial position  
worsened as a result of the lending and she fell behind with other priority bills resulting in her 
borrowing from family members.
Myjar says it asked  Miss B about  her income  and expenditure and checked  her credit file 
before it lent to her. It says its affordability checks were appropriate and its borrowing 
decisions were based on the available information.  It offered to set up a repayment  plan for 
the outstanding balance  of loan 7.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint was upheld. She found Miss B was showing 
signs of struggling to repay the loans when  she applied  for loan 5 and by loan 6, her pattern 
of borrowing  suggested  shed become reliant on the borrowing. She recommended  Myjar 
should refund interest and charges on loans 5 to 7 (plus 8% statutory interest)  and use the 
money to reduce the outstanding balance. She also said that adverse information about  loan 
5 should be removed from Miss Bs credit file and loans  6 and 7 should be removed entirely.
Myjar responded to say, in summary,  that there wasnt enough evidence in the assessment 
and the recommended  outcome lacked  a detailed explanation.
my provisional findings
I issued my provisional decision to Miss B and to Myjar on 28 October  2019.  I summarise my 
findings here:
I was satisfied that Myjar did proportionate  checks for loans 1 to 4 and that there was 
nothing in the available information that indicated  Miss B was struggling to manage  
her money;
By loan 5 I considered Myjar should  have  carried out a full financial review  - this was 
Miss Bs fifth loan in quick succession,  the amount had increased significantly and 
shed been borrowing  from Myjar for over a year;
But I couldnt see that such a review would  have indicated the repayments were  
unaffordable or unsustainable so I didnt conclude Myjar was wrong to approve 
loan 5;
Ref: DRN40860672However, by loan 6, I considered Myjar should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable because:
oMiss B had been borrowing  almost continuously  from Myjar for over 15 
months with only small gaps between loan;
oit ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Miss B was having  to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loans was leaving in 
her finances and that Miss Bs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably;
oMiss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Myjar. Loan 7 
was taken out 16 months after her first and it was over four times the amount;
othe loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Bs indebtedness by 
allowing her to take expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an 
extended period  of time;
othe sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on 
Miss Bs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
So my provisional decision was that I upheld Miss Bs complaint about  loans  6 and 7.
Myjar accepted  my provisional  decision, but Miss B did not respond.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party provided any additional  information,  and Myjar accepted  my provisional 
decision, I see no reason  to depart  from it.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold Miss Bs complaint. MYJAR Limited should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Miss B paid on loans 6 and 7;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loan 7, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Miss B; 
The number of loans  taken by the time Miss B applied for loans 6 and 7 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loan 6 and loan 7 
(one it has been repaid) should  be removed from Miss Bs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Myjar to take off tax from this interest. Myjar must give 
Miss B a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one. If Myjar intends  
to apply the refund to reduce any capital balance, it must  do so after deducting the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 6 January 2020.
