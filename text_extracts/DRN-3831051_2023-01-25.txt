DRN-3831051
The complaint
Mrs B complains that Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited cancelled her income replacer 
policy.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. 
Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Aviva (and the associated bank) chose to withdraw this policy from the market. That 
was a legitimate commercial decision made by Aviva, and so I cant interfere in this. 
Aviva chose to do this for all its customers, so Im satisfied Mrs B wasnt treated 
unfairly.
The policy terms allowed Aviva to withdraw cover.
Mrs B was told on 30 June 2022 that the insurance cover would end on 30 
September 2022. I agree with our investigator that three months was a reasonable 
notice period. 
I recognise that Mrs B is disappointed that her cover ended, as she hasnt been able 
to find another policy for a similar cost. Thats unfortunate but I dont require Aviva to 
return Mrs Bs premiums. Thats because, whilst the policy was in force, Aviva was 
on risk to pay any valid claim made by Mrs B.
For these reasons, I dont uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 February 2023.
