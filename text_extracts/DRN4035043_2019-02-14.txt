K820x#14complaint
Mr U complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc made excessive charges against him for 
repossession and sale of his mortgaged  property.
 
background
Mr Us property was mortgaged to NatWest. He got into arrears with the repayments and on 
11 July 2016 the county  court made orders that Mr U give NatWest  possession of the 
property by 25 July 2016 and that he pay £79,463.10, the amount outstanding  as at 11 July 
2016.
In his complaint  Mr U says that the property  was sold for £115,000 and that he received a 
surplus of £24,000.  But he calculates that the balance due to NatWest  was then about 
£66,000, leaving a surplus of £49,000. So he says NatWest charged about £25,000 as costs  
of sale. He agrees  with the interest and estate agents fees, but these could  not exceed 
£10,000, leaving legal fees of £15,000,  which was excessive. 
On his complaint  to NatWest it said it hadnt  charged  excessive  repossession costs of about 
£25,000. It said the property was sold on 25 September  2017,  and Mr U had received a 
surplus of £24,293.81 made  up as follows:
proceeds of sale 115,000.00
less:
redemption of mortgage 86,645.29
asset manager and estate  agents fees 3,510.00
solicitors fees for the sale 439.80
solicitors fees for distributing the surplus 82.00
bank transfer 30.00
interest gained on surplus funds -0.90 90,706.19
surplus 24,293.81
Mr U wasnt happy and brought his complaint to this service. He said the court  order  showed 
£79,463 outstanding as at 11 July 2016. Interest  at 4% to 25 September 2017 was £3,710. 
So the redemption  figure should  be £83,170. The difference of £3,675 was unexplained.
Mr U said NatWest had given a redemption figure  of £86,645. This £14,600 wasnt  explained 
by any kind of bill or evidence and even if it was the legal costs  involved it was unreasonable 
and illogical. Estate agents reasonably  charged  2% of the sale price, accordingly it should be 
£2,350. An additional £1,200 was charged as asset  manager fees,  the need for which Mr U 
didnt understand  as the property was in a good state of repair and well maintained, and the 
sale was handled  by the estate agents. An additional charge of £90 was made for 
distributing the surplus, whereas internet banking transfers were free.
Our investigator didnt  recommend Mr Us complaint be upheld. He said the total cost 
incurred during the repossession  and sale of the property was £4,061.80. He was unable to 
conclude that any of the costs incurred or levied during the repossession  and sale were 
unreasonable or excessive.
He was aware that Mr U questioned the outstanding  balance on the mortgage account. 
According to Mr Us calculation, the last account balance was £66,000. But the investigator 
Ref: DRN40350432was unable to agree. On 11 July 2016  the court order had noted  that Mr U owed £79,463.10.  
Mr U had missed  many  monthly payments from this point until the property was sold. The 
monthly payments  due were initially £412.15  and later increased to £444.39. All of these 
outstanding payments would have increased  the mortgage balance  of £79,463.10 so the 
investigator couldnt agree that the balance should  have  been £66,000.
The investigator said Mr U had also mentioned that excessive  legal  fees of about £15,000 
had been charged. But this service had no remit  to examine the fees charged by third party 
solicitors. Generally lenders were entitled to pass legal costs onto the borrower and add 
them to the outstanding balance. This wasnt unreasonable. In cases such  as this legal  costs  
would often run into many  thousands  of pounds.
But it seemed  to the investigator that most  of these legal costs were  incurred before the date 
when the court decided that Mr U owed £79,463.10 to NatWest. This service  couldnt 
overturn or challenge court decisions.  This meant we couldnt look at any costs or charges 
added to the mortgage balance before  11 July 2016.
Mr U didnt agree. He acknowledged  that court orders couldnt be overturned. But he wasnt  
disputing the court order or any third party  charges. His argument was about the high costs  
charged by NatWest, over and above  a reasonable mathematical calculation, without 
explanation.
It was agreed that the mortgage  balance  on 11 July 2016 was £79,463, including most of the 
legal costs. The interest for 1 year and 2.5 months  was nearly £3,844  (rounded  off). The 
investigator had calculated the other costs to be £4,062 (rounded off). Therefore the total 
redemption figure  according  to the investigators  calculation couldnt exceed  £87,369  
(roughly). Accordingly he was entitled to a surplus  of £27,631  (rounded  off). The redemption 
figure was such that NatWest had charged an interest rate more than the allowable  standard  
variable rate (SVR).
The investigator didnt  follow  this calculation and asked Mr U to clarify how he came to the 
conclusion that he was entitled  to a surplus of £27,631. Mr U said the mortgage balance 
when he stopped making payments was £66,000. The property  was sold for £115,000.  
Therefore a surplus of £49,000  was left with NatWest to make up the shortfall  and remit the 
remainder to him. 
The mortgage balance  as decided by the court including legal costs was £79,500. NatWest 
was entitled to charge the SVR until the property was sold, pursuant  to the terms and 
conditions of the mortgage product. The interest for 1 year and 2.5 months  was nearly  
£3,844. The investigator had calculated  the other costs  to be £4,062. Therefore the total 
redemption figure  according  to the investigators  calculation couldnt exceed  £87,369.  
Accordingly Mr U should have received £27,631.
The investigator put these figures to NatWest who provided a list of the transactions  on the 
account from 14 December 2011 to 28 September 2017  showing the closing payment of 
£86,645.29. 
Mr U replied that an error of calculation  could be deduced from this. It might  be anything 
from fabrication of data to arithmetical error.  An entry dated 14 August 2016 of £2,721.84  
could not be explained by any reasonable logic. And the closing account showed £85,830 
with no reasonable adjustment  to show £86,645, a difference of £813. So he believed  he 
was entitled to £3,552.
Ref: DRN40350433NatWest said the £2,721.84  comprised  £2,451  legal  fees for litigation billed on 
1 August 2016  and £270.84  interest applied. The closing figures were:
£82,999.00 Balance as at 1/1/2017 
£2,498.46 interest  applied  from 1/1/2017 to redemption
£1,139.00 litigation  fees billed in 2017
£86,636.46 redemption figure as at 27/9/2017
£86,645.29 received included 1x DRA @ £8.82  (0.01p difference)
The investigator said Mr U had made no repayments from 11 July 2016 when the court 
issued the possession order, until 27 September 2017 when the mortgage was redeemed. 
So the interest charged was added to the capital balance.
Mr U said the litigation figures  were unreasonable and fabricated. There could be no 
question of any litigation when the property was already repossessed and ready for sale.  All 
litigation fees had already  been added into the court order.  NatWest was entitled  to charge 
interest on £79,463.10. The interest should have been £1,673 and the balance on 
1 January 2017 should have been £81,163. The interest added  to this until sale should  be 
£2,283, producing a redemption figure of £83,446. 
The difference between this and £86,645  was £3,199,  but the investigator couldnt agree 
that NatWest should refund this amount. He didnt think  Mr U had factored in that the 
balance was not static but increased each month  by the amount of interest which  wasnt 
paid. It wasnt unusual  for lenders to apply legal  charges at a later date. Overall,  the charges 
applied in this specific case didnt seem excessive.
Mr U asked that his case  be referred  to an ombudsman.  He said factoring in the interest,  the 
redemption figure  would be £83,722.  Even if legal fees were added to this it would amount to 
£84,861. He didnt understand the basis  of levying litigation charges at any time. When the 
property was under the sole control  of the lender, then what  kind of, and with whom, was the 
litigation for which the charges were levied? NatWest had levied a litigation  charge just 15 
days before  the sale, which was highly unreasonable.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The difference between £86,645 and what I take to be Mr Us final figure of £83,722 is 
£2,923. This is more  than accounted for by the litigation fees, which  appear  now to be the 
main issue  of objection.
I can see that NatWest debited a litigation fee of £683 on 14 September 2017, shortly before 
the sale, but it doesnt follow that this must have been for work  carried out after NatWest  had 
taken possession. On balance I think its more likely to have been  the solicitors  bill for work 
done pursuant to instructions to enforce the possession order, but I have no evidence  on this 
point.
From the transaction list the litigation  fees charged  since 11 July 2016 are:
1 August 2016 2451.00
12 September 2016 120.00
Ref: DRN4035043424 January 2017 396.00
14 June 2017 60.00
14 September 2017 683.00
Total £3,710.00
It seems  to me probable that the entry dated  1 August 2016 included  fees for the hearing  on 
11 July 2016.  Its evident from the court order that Mr U had filed a defence and also a 
counterclaim against NatWest. Subsequently, he had amended it. The proceedings were 
defended and NatWests solicitors, reasonably  in my view, had briefed counsel to represent 
NatWest. In those circumstances I dont think the costs incurred were unreasonable.
The litigation  fees charged throughout were much  higher than is normal  for possession 
proceedings in the county court. However I consider  this is most likely due to the way in 
which Mr U conducted the proceedings, notably the filing of a defence and counterclaim 
against NatWest.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr U to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2019.
