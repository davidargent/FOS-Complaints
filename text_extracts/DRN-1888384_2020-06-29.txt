Sunny considered Mr Cs complaint and accepted that something may have gone wrong 
when it provided loans 21 to 37. And it has already refunded interest on these loans and 
cleared the outstanding balance for loans to 34, 36 and 37. I understand loans 21 to 37 have 
also been removed from Mr Cs credit file. Initially Mr C accepted the offer but withdrew the 
acceptance before the refund was completed. But Sunny completed the refund and referred 
Mr C to this Service to consider the remaining loans. Our adjudicator didnt think it was wrong to have granted the first five instalment loans. But 
she thought the remaining instalment loans in dispute (loans 6 to 20) shouldnt have been 
given. 
Mr C appears to agree with the adjudicators view but Sunny disagreed. Sunny says that
Mr C may have taken out loans within a short space of time because it was a more 
manageable way of dealing with his finances  rather than because he was having problems 
managing his money as the adjudicator suggested. Sunny though did agree that loans 15 to 
20 shouldnt have been lent. 
Sunnys offer for loans 15 to 20 is in line with the adjudicators recommendation that it should 
refund interest paid on these loans together with 8% simple interest. And it has agreed to 
remove these loans from Mr Cs credit file. Mr C wasnt happy with this offer because it 
wasnt in line with what the adjudicator recommended.  
As no agreement has been reached, the case has been passed to me for a final decision on 
the remaining loans in dispute, 6 to 14.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
For the lending that remains in dispute, Sunny had to assess if Mr C could afford to pay back 
the amounts hed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Sunnys checks could have taken into account a number 
of different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments and Mr Cs 
income and expenditure. With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, less thorough checks might have been proportionate. 
But certain factors might suggest Sunny should have done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr C. These factors include: 
Mr C having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr C having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr C coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr C.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr C could sustainably repay his instalment loans 
 not just whether he technically had enough money to make his repayments. Having 
enough money to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mr C was able 
to repay his loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. The 
Financial Conduct Authority (the industry regulatory) says in the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and in particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and 
without having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have 
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, 
then it follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Cs complaint.
loans 6 to 12
As our adjudicator explained, by loan 6 Sunny should reasonably have known that its likely 
that Mr C was struggling to repay his loans in a sustainable way. This is because loan 3 was 
taken out two days after repayment of loan 1; loan 5 was taken out two days after repayment 
of loans 3 and 4; and loan 6 was taken out three days after loan 5 was repaid. And each of 
these new loans was taken out for the same amount, or around that, of the repaid loan(s). 
So, I think the way Mr C was taking these loans meant that Sunny shouldnt have given loan 
6 or subsequent loans. I also think if Sunny had carried out proportionate checks for loan 6, 
from what I can see, these wouldve revealed that Mr C was also borrowing from other short 
term and high cost lenders around this time  a further indication that Mr C was most likely 
struggling to manage his finances before this loan was given.   
In these circumstances, there was a significant risk that Mr C wouldnt be able to repay loan 
6, or any later loans, without undue difficulty.
Sunny feels Mr C may have arranged his finances in this way as it may have been more 
manageable than taking out one larger loan. It seems unlikely to me that a consumer would 
spread their need for a solution to a short-term gap in their finances through several loans 
with gaps between them. A loan is usually taken out for the amount a consumer needs at 
that time, rather than staggering their financial shortfall over a few months. 
I can also see that when Sunny gave the first five loans Mr Cs income was relatively low, so 
he appeared to have less scope to deal with shortfalls in his finances. I think its more likely 
than not that the very short gap between loans 1, 3, 4 and 5 being repaid and further loans 
being taken out, was an indication that Mr C needed to borrow again to fill a gap in his 
finances. 
loans 13 to 20
Having looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, I agree with our 
adjudicator that Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided loan 13. I say this because:
By loan 13 it was almost eight months into the lending relationship with no significant 
breaks between loans. Some of the loans overlapped. In my view, Mr Cs loan history 
up until this point was a clear indication that his underlying financial situation didnt 
seem to be improving; 
Mr C took some loans shortly after having repaid previous ones. As well as loans 3, 5 
and 6, loans 7, 9, 11, 12 and 13 were all taken out shortly after repayment of 
previous lending. 
 So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr C, on these occasions, was 
having to borrow further to cover the hole the repayment of the previous loans had left in his 
finances, and that this was indicative of his indebtedness not being sustainable;
The loans show a broadly similar pattern of borrowing. All loans ranged between £50 
to £250. I think its most likely this consistent pattern of borrowing over the period 
showed that Mr C didnt just have a short-term cash-flow problem but was probably 
supporting regular living expenses or other financial commitments;    
Mr Cs lending history was prolonged with loans continuing to be taken shortly after 
repayment of previous lending through to March 2019. Mr C borrowed for a period of 
two years without any breaks. The amount of time that Mr C spent indebted to Sunny 
meant that he was servicing a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr C lost out when Sunny provided loans 13 and 14 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Mr Cs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So, Im upholding Mr Cs complaint about loans 6 to 14. And Ive set out what Sunny should 
do to put things right as detailed below - Ive also included loans 15 to 20 which, as Ive 
explained, Sunny has already agreed it shouldnt have lent. 
Putting things right
Considering what Sunny has already agreed to do, in order to put things right it should: 
refund all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 6 to 20;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove adverse information about loans 6 to 12 from Mr Cs credit file;
remove loans 13 to 20 from Mr Cs credit file entirely, this is because the period of 
time Mr C owed Sunny money means that any information still recorded about these 
loans is adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must 
give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I partly uphold Mr Cs complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should put things right for Mr C as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 July 2020.
