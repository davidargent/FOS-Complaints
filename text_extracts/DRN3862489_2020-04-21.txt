K821x#15complaint
Mr K has complained about a number of loans  he took out through a company called  
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr K says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Mr K took out some 18 instalment loans from Sunny between May 2016 
and August 2018, although there was a significant  gap in the lending after the first 2 loans.  
Ive enclosed a summary  of Mr Ks borrowing with Sunny, based on the information it 
provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan number  12 onwards. Sunny initially said it hadnt  done anything wrong 
although much later,  it offered  to settle from the point of loan 17. The complaint has come to 
me for an ombudsmans  final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Ks 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr K could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable  manner.  These checks  ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN38624892There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr K could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr K could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr K. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern of lending with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some  point, 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loans 1 - 2 and 3 -11 ought  not to 
be upheld as they appeared affordable. Ive described them in two blocks like this because 
of the 13 month break in lending and in accordance with our normal  approach, we consider 
these as separate lending  chains. 
I have taken note of Mr Ks declared income and Ive also looked at what  he said about his 
monthly expenditure. With all this information,  and bearing in mind what  Ive said above 
about the length of the (two)  separate lending  relationship(s), I think the checks  which Sunny 
most likely carried  out appear to have been  proportionate for loans 1  2 and for loans 3 - 
11. I think these levels  of checks,  together with the income and expenditure details provided 
by Mr K, would have made all these  particular loans appear affordable.  Mr Ks 
representatives havent showed  me anything that proves otherwise. So Im not upholding  
this part of the complaint.
However, I think the emerging pattern of repeated lending from the point of loan 12 onwards 
in this case would have looked  different and therefore required a more thorough and 
responsible approach. The overall  pattern of Sunnys lending to Mr K should have caused it 
to see, in my view,  that it shouldnt have  provided any further loans from this point onwards. 
This is because this was Mr Ks tenth continuous short-term loan application with Sunny in 
just 6 months. In common with his borrowing pattern thus far, he was again asking to borrow 
from Sunny  relatively  soon after paying  off a previous loan and indeed  whilst  other  lending  
was still outstanding. His borrowing was also increasing in value. So Sunny ought to have 
realised that Mr K wasnt merely borrowing to deal with short-term cash-flow problems; he 
was borrowing very regularly, to address shortfalls  in his income and to meet an ongoing 
need. Mr K was having to consistently  take out high interest, short-term  lending over a 
sustained period and the indebtedness  caused  by this type of borrowing was harmful,  in my 
view. Sunny should have seen this and ought to have realised Mr K was at risk of not 
managing to repay the loans sustainably  or getting into financial difficulties. 
So Im upholding  this complaint in respect of loans 12 - 18. Sunny repeatedly lent to Mr K in 
an unsustainable manner  because:
Ref: DRN38624893 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr K borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans 12 - 18;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
the number  of loans taken from loan 12 onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 12 -18 should  be completely 
removed from Mr Ks credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Mr K a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Ks complaint. Elevate Credit  International Limited  
should put things right for Mr K as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 21 May 2020.
