The complaint
Mr T complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wont refund a purchase after initially 
agreeing to do so.
What happened
Mr T was the highest bidder for an item from a third party auction company. He paid Â£3,200 
for the item through PayPal but when the item was delivered on 11 June 2020 Mr T said that 
the item was not as it was described. He believed the item was a counterfeit item and 
refused to accept the delivery.
Mr T contacted the third party auction company to obtain a refund and raised a dispute with 
PayPal on 12 June 2020. As a result of this, the third party auction company said they 
couldnt process a refund as Mr T had raised this through PayPal.
On 19 June 2020 the seller had agreed to issue a full refund upon return of the item. PayPal 
asked Mr T to provide them with proof of delivery. PayPal define proof of delivery as (i) a 
status of delivered (or equivalent) and the date of delivery (ii) the recipients address, 
showing at least the city/county or postcode (or international equivalent). PayPal told Mr T 
that evidence would need to be uploaded to the resolution centre by 29 June 2020.
PayPal sent two reminders to Mr T on 22 June 2020 and 26 June 2020 but Mr T didnt 
respond to these as PayPal were asking for additional information but didnt document what 
additional information they required on the messages.
On 29 June 2020 PayPal declined Mr Ts dispute as they hadnt received the evidence they 
asked for. Mr T complained to PayPal and explained that as he refused to accept the item he 
had no tracking number/delivery status. 
PayPal didnt uphold his complaint as they had no confirmation from the seller that he had 
received the item back and Mr T wasnt able to provide PayPal with the required information. 
PayPal said he didnt meet the PayPal buyer protection conditions, specifically the following:
PayPal may request and require you to (and you shall in a timely manner): (i) provide 
documentary evidence (at your own expense, unless PayPal agrees otherwise) to support 
your position (including, without limitation, proof of delivery, receipts, third party evaluations 
and police reports); and (ii) take any other action that PayPal specifies. If you refuse to 
comply with PayPals requests, PayPal may make a final decision in favour of the other 
party.
Mr T has raised complaints with other bodies such as the police, trading standards and had 
attempted to have the case mediated at court. There is currently no court dates agreed at 
the moment although Mr T says he would rather not go down this route. Hes said he wishes 
for the complaint to be resolved before court action.
Mr T brought his complaint to our service as he wasnt happy with the response from 
PayPal. He provided us photographic evidence of the purchased item and a re-delivery 
invoice from the delivery company dated 11 August 2020 (the return of the item was delayed 
due to COVID). Mr T said he didnt ask PayPal to raise a dispute for a refund and that had 
PayPal not done this then he mightve been able to obtain a refund from the third party 
auction company instead. 
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Ts complaint. The investigator summarised that Mr T 
hadnt met the PayPal buyer protection conditions. Mr T said to the investigator that he didnt 
ask for PayPal to process the refund but our investigator explained that by raising a dispute 
and saying he would like to make use of whatever protection PayPal can offer that the 
investigator concluded that the claim wasnt raised against his wishes.
Mr T asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an Ombudsman and raised further points for 
consideration. He said he didnt know PayPal and the third party auction company werent 
related and felt PayPal should have directed him to the third party first. He noted that he 
didnt have a tracking number as he rejected the delivery of the item and raised the legality 
of returning what he felt was a counterfeit item.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When considering the merits of an individual complaint I need to consider whether the 
company involved in the complaint have acted how they shouldve and Im satisfied PayPal 
have acted fairly towards Mr T. I will outline my reasons why below.
Mr T raised a dispute with PayPal and asked them to look into the purchase. He also asked 
PayPal to make use of whatever protection they can offer. Thats what PayPal did here. 
They asked Mr T to provide proof that the item had been delivered, as that is one of the 
conditions of their buyer protection scheme. When Mr T couldnt provide the evidence, the 
buyer protection policy wasnt met and so PayPal didnt refund the purchase. PayPal 
reached out to the seller, but as the seller didnt confirm that they had received the item then 
Im satisfied that PayPal have tried to help Mr T. They followed the terms of the protection 
policy and did what they could have been expected to do here.
I understand why Mr T hasnt been able to get the evidence PayPal required as he simply 
refused to accept the delivery of the item, as he felt it wasnt delivered as described. 
Unfortunately, the invoice he provided from the transit company doesnt show that the item 
was successfully delivered to the seller or include a tracking number so PayPal has said it 
wont process the refund. But I cant hold PayPal responsible for the actions which Mr T 
decided to take, although I can understand the reason why he did this. It remains that 
without this information, PayPal explains that it may decline a claim under its buyer 
protection scheme and so I think it did this fairly here.
Mr T says he didnt realise that the third party auction company and PayPal werent linked 
and PayPal shouldve directed him to the third party before raising a dispute. PayPal has 
explained that they and the third party company are two separate companies, so PayPal can 
only reasonably follow out Mr Ts instructions in terms of its own procedures for helping 
customers. Ultimately, PayPal raised a dispute in line with what Mr T told them he wanted 
them to do and they followed their procedures in doing so I think that was fair here.
Its not for this service to reach a finding on the legality of returning counterfeit goods or Mr 
Ts argument that PayPal shouldnt require him to do so. Our service is a quick and informal 
alternative to the courts. So while Ive considered what hes had to say about this, Ive 
thought about this impartially  alongside what PayPal have said here. With that in mind PayPal are entitled to set their own fair requirements for how refunds to be processed and 
Im satisfied theyve done that here and treated Mr T fairly  even if it hasnt led to the 
outcome he wanted. 
PayPal have said if Mr T can provide the evidence the transaction was delivered to the seller 
and provide a tracking number then they would still be able to look into the dispute. So Mr T 
might want to contact the transit company to obtain this information. If the transit company 
are able to provide this information this may help resolve Mr Ts complaint but as PayPal 
havent done anything wrong here it follows that Ill not be asking them to do anything 
further.
My final decision
I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 March 2021.
