Miss Y says Elevate Credit International  Limited,  trading as Sunny (Sunny) 
irresponsibly lent to her.
background
I issued my provisional decision in January 2020,  a copy of which  is attached and forms
part of this final decision. There is a table at the end of this decision which  shows  some of 
the information Sunny has provided about the lending.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I was intending to uphold  Miss Ys complaint 
about loans 8 to 23. I asked everyone  to send me any further  comments  and
information before I reached a final decision.  
Miss Y had nothing further to provide. Sunny had some further  comments, in summary it 
said:
Miss Y taking out seven loans in six months  doesnt automatically indicate she was 
having problems  managing money;
There were  some  small breaks between lending  so theres no consistent  pattern of 
borrowing;
Miss Y was never in arrears and repaid  all her loans with Sunny;
Miss Y had sufficient  disposable income  and was required to use a small proportion 
make her repayments;  and
There is no evidence that Miss Y was having difficulties in making her repayments. 
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive carefully considered  what Sunny  has said but this doesnt  change my decision. I am still 
upholding loans  8 to 23. 
Sunny has said it doesnt agree that it was wrong  to grant loans 1 to 16. I havent upheld 
loans 1 to 7  so I dont think Sunny was wrong  to lend these  loans. Miss Y hasnt disagreed 
with what Ive said about loans 1 to 7 so I wont be looking at these any further as there is no 
ongoing disagreement about them. But I will bear them in mind  when Im looking at Miss Ys 
other lending.
I explained my reasoning  as to why Miss Ys complaint  should  be partly  upheld in the 
provisional decision. But Sunny has received a number of final decisions from colleagues 
and our approach  to dealing with these types  of cases  can be found  on our website.  We 
would expect Sunny to learn from these decisions and from our approach when considering  
these types of cases. 
The regulations say that assessments  needed to be proportionate to the circumstances of 
the lending and the consumer. It may be reasonable early  on to rely on what the consumer 
has said or to rely on assumptions about their circumstances, but it might not be reasonable 
to do so in all circumstances.  
Ref: DRN78350142Given the number  of times Miss Y borrowed shortly after making  a repayment, I think  its 
more likely than not that making  her repayments left her short,  irrespective of the amounts 
involved.
The FCA and OFT have  both been  very clear that lenders need to consider the potential 
harm caused by relending  and that not doing  so would  be irresponsible.  
CONC 6.7.22G says:
A firm should not allow a customer to enter  into consecutive agreements  with the firm for 
high-cost short-term credit if the cumulative effect  of the agreements  would be that the total 
amount payable by the customer is unsustainable.  [Note: paragraph 6.25 (box) of ILG]
Section 6.25 of the ILG focuses specifically  on short-term credit products and says that it 
would be a deceptive and/or unfair  practice where a lender is:
Repeatedly refinancing (or 'rolling over') a borrower's existing credit commitment  for a 
short-term credit product  in a way that is unsustainable or otherwise harmful.
Section 6.25 then goes  on to say:
The OFT considers that this would include a creditor allowing a borrower to sequentially 
enter into a number of separate  agreements  for short-term loan products, one after another,  
where the overall effect is to increase  the borrower's indebtedness in an unsustainable  
manner
And
The purpose of payday loans is to act as a short-term solution to temporary
cash flow problems experienced by consumers.  They are not appropriate for
supporting sustained borrowing over longer periods, for which other products
are likely to be more  suitable.
A Dear CEO letter from the FCA in March  2019 said that a high volume  of relending  may be 
symptomatic of unsustainable lending patterns: 
https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/portfolio-letter-firms-high-cost-lending.pdf
The purpose of short-term loans was set out in OFT guidance (Section 6.25 referenced by 
CONC Section 6.7). They  are a short  term solution  to temporary cash  flow problems. The 
FCA defined what is meant by this short-term  solution (credit due to be repaid or 
substantially repaid within 12 months of advancement). And in this complaint, I think by the 
time Miss Y asked for Loan 8 she was not likely to have been borrowing to solve a short-
term problem but rather to meet an ongoing  need.  
I am not concluding  that Miss Y was unable  to access any form of mainstream credit of any 
amount because of Sunnys loans. But it is my experience that prolonged use of high-cost 
short-term credit over extended periods is more likely  than not to be been viewed negatively  
by other  lenders. And so I remain satisfied that there was a risk that agreeing further credit at 
this point would cause harm. 
Sunny has said there were small breaks  in lending which  I acknowledge. And I have 
considered it as two chains of lending. However, as well as taking out loans when previous 
Ref: DRN78350143loans were outstanding, after repaying her loans Miss Y would return to borrow further in a 
matter of days. For example,  after paying for loans 4 and 5 at the same  and repaying them 
on the same  day, Miss Y returned 15 days to take out loan 6. So, as said in my provisional 
decision, I believe Miss Y was having to borrow further to cover a hole in her finances. 
Sunny has said Miss Y was never in arrears and repaid all of her Sunny loans. It has also 
said she was only required to use a small proportion of her monthly income to make her 
repayments to Sunny  and always had sufficient monthly disposable  income. Ive looked  at 
the overall pattern of lending history  with Miss Y and I believe by the time loan 8 was taken, 
Sunny should  have  seen  that further  lending was unsustainable or otherwise harmful.  And 
so should not have  provided any further loans. These loans had the effect of unfairly 
prolonging Miss Ys indebtedness  by allowing her to take expensive  credit intended for short-
term use over an extended period of time.
Sunny has said Miss Y didnt inform  it of any difficulties  she was having repaying her loans. 
Whilst Miss Y did not declare anything, as Ive already said,  her lending pattern should have 
indicated that something wasnt right. 
Ive also thought about Sunnys comments in relation to the credit file, but as Ive said above, 
this service has issued a number of decisions  explaining why we think  that for some loans 
records should be deleted  from a credit file. And in this case, I think it is appropriate for loan 
8 onwards to be deleted  from Miss Ys credit file. 
Firstly, because we are satisfied that Miss Y has suffered detriment because Sunny 
approved these loans and secondly,  I think it is more likely  than not that as result  of these 
loans Miss Ys ability to obtain mainstream credit  has been affected.  
So having  thought about the points Sunny has made, these  havent  changed my mind  about 
which loans I think should be upheld.  And  for the reasons Ive outlined  above, and in my 
provisional decision I still think Sunny was wrong to have provided loans 8 to 23. 
Ive taken everything Sunny has said in to consideration but it does not change my decision. 
Im partially upholding Miss Ys complaint about loans 8 to 23. 
Ref: DRN78350144my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ys complaint  and Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out in my provisional decision.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss Y accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 April 2020.

Ref: DRN78350146complaint
Miss Y says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly lent to 
her.
background
This complaint is about  one running credit account (loan  1) and 22 instalment loans Sunny provided 
to Miss Y between  November 2014 and February 2018. There is a table at the end of this decision 
which shows some of the information Sunny has provided about the lending.
Miss Y has said she should  not have been given  the loans as she couldnt afford  them. She was 
struggling to make repayments to other lenders  as well as the loans she had with Sunny.  She has 
said if Sunny  had checked  her credit  reports it would have seen the financial difficulties she was in. 
Sunny has said creditworthiness checks were conducted and proportionate and responsible checks  
were completed at the time.
Our adjudicator upheld Miss Ys complaint in part and thought the loans from loan 7 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny  disagreed  with the adjudicators opinion.  It did agree that it should 
have done things differently after approving loan 17. So it offered compensation on this basis.
Miss Y didnt accept this offer and so the complaint  has been  passed to me.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in 
the circumstances of this complaint. Weve  set out our general  approach to complaints about  
short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry  practice - on our 
website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Miss Y could repay  the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different  things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  
to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors include:
 the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any 
loan repayments  to a given  loan amount from a lower level of income);
 the higher  the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment  from a particular level of income);
 the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time 
during which a customer has been given loans  (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish  whether  Miss 
Y could sustainably  repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
Ref: DRN78350147pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet
the repayments.
And it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make 
their repayments without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully  considered  all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ys complaint. Im intending to uphold Miss Ys 
complaint in part and have explained why below.
Miss Y hasnt  disputed  our adjudicators findings about  loans  1 to 6 so I wont be considering these  
loans any further because they are no longer in dispute.
Our adjudicator thought that Sunny should not have approved loan 7. But having looked  at the 
circumstances of the sale I dont think the lending  had become unsustainable at this point. And I 
havent seen anything else that leads  me to conclude that Sunny was wrong to approve this loan.  
So Im not intending to uphold Miss Ys complaint about this loan.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  history with Miss Y, with a view to seeing if there 
was a point at which  Sunny  should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful.  And so Sunny should have realised  that it shouldnt have provided any further  
loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ys case, I think that this point  was reached by loan 8 
for the following reasons:
 by loan 8 Miss Y had taken  out 7 loans  within  6 months.  So Sunny ought  to have realised  
it was more likely than not Miss Y was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying 
her previous  loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Ys indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably;
 Miss Ys first loan in the second chain of lending was for £250 and loan 8 was for
£700. This was a significant increase At this point  Sunny  ought to have known that Miss 
Y was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in their income but to meet  an 
ongoing need;
 from loan 8 onwards  Miss Y was provided  with new loans a very short  time after settling 
a previous one. And she often had more than one loan running at the same time;
 Miss Y wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 23 was taken  
out around two and a half years  after loan 2 which was the start of this chain  of lending. And 
whilst the loan amounts could fluctuate  I havent seen a significant  decrease in Miss Ys 
overall indebtedness. Miss Y had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt 
to Sunny over an extended  period.
I think  that Miss Y lost out because  Sunny  continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because:
 these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Miss Ys indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive  credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended period of time.
Ref: DRN78350148 the number of loans and the length  of time over which  Miss Y borrowed  was likely to have  
had negative implications  on Miss Ys ability  to access  mainstream credit and so kept her 
in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im intending to uphold the complaint about  loans 8 to 23 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things  right  what Sunny needs to do
 refund all interest and charges Miss Y paid on loans 8 to 23;
 pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 the number of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse. So all entries about loans 7 to 23 should be removed from Miss Ys 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Miss Y a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im intending to partially upholding Miss Ys complaint and will ask 
Elevate Credit International Limited to put things right as set out above.
I will now await a response from both parties.
