complaint
Mr M complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid and Pounds  to Pocket) 
lent to him in an irresponsible manner.
background
Mr M took 5 payday loans  from QuickQuid between June 2016 and March 2018  and an 
instalment loan from Pounds to Pocket  in April 2017.  The instalment loan was refinanced in 
July 2017 and Mr M took some additional borrowing. I intend to treat that additional 
borrowing as refinancing the original  loan. All of Mr Ms loans  have been  successfully  repaid  
and a summary of his borrowing  from QuickQuid and Pounds to Pocket is as follows;

Mr Ms complaint has been  assessed  by one of our adjudicators. He didnt think CashEuroNet 
should have given Mr M any of the loans it gave him. He thought that the information that 
Casheruonet had from its own credit  checks suggested that Mr Ms declared credit  outgoings 
were unreliable and CashEuroNet  should  have done  some further checking. He thought that if 
these checks had been carried out the business would have seen that the loans were 
unaffordable for Mr M. So he asked CashEuroNet to pay Mr M some compensation.
CashEuroNet didnt  agree  with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved  
informally, it has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our 
process. If Mr M accepts my decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
CashEuroNet needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that
Mr M could  repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account  a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
Ref: DRN50977062But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet  should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  include:
the lower a customers  income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet  was required to 
establish whether  Mr M could sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict  pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as 
being without  undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without having 
to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought  fairly 
and reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  
sustainably if theyre  unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Mr M asked  to borrow £200 in June  2016. The repayments on this loan were over three 
instalments. Interest only was due of £20 and £48 for the first two repayments and the final 
repayment was the capital  and interest of £235.  Ive taken this payment structure into 
account when  considering  the loans that CashEuroNet gave  to Mr M. Mr M declared that his 
income was £1450 and his total expenses were  £700  this included a figure  of £50 for other  
credit commitments.  CashEuroNet carried out a credit search and this suggested that Mr Ms 
other credit commitments alone were £780 which  was the figure it used  to calculate the 
monthly disposable income. Taking that figure  together with the figures Mr M had given 
about his other normal monthly living costs for food, housing, utilities,  transport and other 
costs Mr Ms outgoings were £1430 and so Mr M didnt have enough disposable  income to 
repay the loan or make the savings over the life of the loan. I think  if CashEuroNet  had 
properly verified Mr Ms income and outgoings  it wouldnt  have agreed  to the loan.
Mr M repaid loan 1 and there was a gap before Mr M applied for or loan 2. Mr M declared his 
income as £1350 and said his outgoing had reduced to £375. This included a figure  of £50 for 
regular credit commitments. However  CashEuroNet applied the figure of £648 for credit 
commitments as a result  of its credit search. I think that by this point given that Mr M had 
significantly underestimated his credit commitments CashEuroNet should have further verified  
Mr Ms outstanding credit.  If it had done  so it wouldve seen that Mr M had around £800 to repay. 
I dont think further  borrowing for Mr M, given  his disposable income, was sustainable here.
Ref: DRN50977063The position  is the same  for loan 3. Mr M again declared credit  commitments of £50 but 
CashEuroNet applied  a figure of £811  but didnt  verify whether Mr M had possibly under-
declared his other outgoings as well. I think it would have been proportionate to verify Mr Ms 
other expenses by checking his bank statements or asking for some  other  information.  If it 
had done CashEuroNet would have discovered  that Mr M hadnt declared all of his 
outgoings and he didnt have enough money  to repay the loan.
Had it asked Mr M for more details of his borrowing and expenses at the time it agreed loan 
4 I think CashEuroNet  would have seen the real difficulties that Mr M was facing in 
managing his money. I think the poor nature of Mr Ms finances  should have been a clear 
indicator that it was unlikely he could afford to repay  any new borrowing in a sustainable 
manner. So I dont  think CashEuroNet should  have given this loan to Mr M either. It follows  
that I dont  think it should  have been  refinanced.
The position  is the same  for loans 5 and 6. Mr M continued to under declare his expenses 
and CashEuroNet  shouldve done more to verify  what Mr M was saying. I have looked at Mr 
Ms bank account statements and his credit  report and I agree with the adjudicator that had 
CashEuroNet done further checking  for these loans it wouldve seen that further lending for 
Mr M was unaffordable  and unsustainable.
putting things right
I dont think CashEuroNet  should have agreed to give Mr M any of the loans. So for each 
loan CashEuroNet  UK LLC should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans.
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded  on Mr Ms credit  file in relation to the loans.
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC must  give Mr M a certificate  showing how much tax its taken  off if he 
asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint and I direct CashEuroNet  UK LLC to put 
things right as set out above.
 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 October  2019.
