DRN-4177991
The complaint
Mr P complains that a buyer dispute with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA was declined. 
Mr Ps account has also been limited. 
What happened
Mr P says he bought a mobile telephone that turned out to be counterfeit. He says he 
contacted PayPal and they told him to send it back, but he didnt get a refund. So, he logged 
a complaint.
PayPal looked into the complaint but didnt uphold it. It said some months after Mr P bought 
the phone, it received a chargeback request from Mr Ps card issuer. It supplied the 
information it was asked for, but the decision to not pay the claim was down to the bank and 
not PayPal. It went on to say that due to the number of claims Mr P had raised, it 
permanently limited his account in March 2022. Mr P remained unhappy, so he brought his 
complaint to our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. Our 
investigator found the limitation had been fair and in line with the User Agreement Mr P 
signed up to. She also found the decision to decline the claim was down to the bank rather 
than PayPal. 
As Mr P didnt agree with our investigators view, the complaints been passed to me for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the investigators outcome, for largely the same reasons. Ill 
explain why. 
For me to say PayPal did something wrong, Id need to be satisfied that they failed to act 
within the terms of the accounts User Agreement. Or, if I feel like they did work within these, 
that it was unfair for it to limit the account in the circumstances of this complaint. And in this 
situation, I dont think thats the case.
PayPal didnt decline the chargeback of funds, Mr Ps bank did. So, PayPals role was to 
supply information to the bank to support Mr Ps case for the return of funds. Ive seen the 
information PayPal sent to Mr Ps bank, and Im satisfied it did wat it was required to do. So, 
I dont find PayPal have acted unfairly in the circumstances of the complaint.
PayPal have also supplied information to show why Mr Ps account was limited and his 
buyer protection removed. Having seen this information, Im satisfied PayPal havent acted 
unfairly or outside of the User Agreement Mr P signed up to when he opened his account. 
Mr P has logged a large number of claims over a short amount of time. PayPals User 
agreement says 
  To be eligible for PayPal Buyer Protection you must meet all of the following requirements: 
 Have a PayPal account in good standing.
PayPal can also end a relationship with a consumer at any point. Our service wont generally 
get involved in a businesss decision to end a relationship with one of its customers, but we 
can look at whether its been done fairly. On this occasion I think it has been.
PayPal sent Mr P a warning about the way he was managing his account and went on to 
limit his account. This means when Mr Ps claim with his bank was declined, it wouldnt have 
been possible to open a buyer dispute with PayPal as his account no longer had that 
protection. 
Mr P has said that he contacted PayPal and it told him to send the phone back to the seller. 
Neither party has supplied any information to evidence this conversation took place. PayPal 
have said the first contact it had regarding the phone was the request from Mr Ps bank for 
information relating to the chargeback. I also find it unlikely PayPal wouldve given Mr P this 
advice without opening a dispute claim and as Ive explained above, this wouldnt have been 
possible at this time. So, I havent found PayPal have done anything wrong regarding this 
point.
In summary, I havent found PayPal have treated Mr P unfairly or acted outside of its User 
Agreement in the circumstances of this complaint. The decision to decline the charge back 
request was made by Mr Ps card issuer and the limitation was applied correctly. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 August 2023.
