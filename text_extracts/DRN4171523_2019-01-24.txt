K821x#15complaint
Mr D complains that NewDay Ltd didnt register a default on his account  at the same time as 
his other  creditors. It affected his rating.
background
Mr D had a credit card provided by NewDay. He got into difficulty with his payments. And in 
August 2010 he entered into a debt management plan. When he checked his credit  file he 
noticed that NewDay didnt default  his account  as soon  as he started the plan. Instead itd 
continued to apply late payment markers until 2012.
If NewDay had reported the default  in 2010  like his other creditors then it wouldve been 
removed from his credit file by now. But NewDay only registered  it in November 2012. Mr D 
said he thought  hed already defaulted  when he stopped  making his minimum monthly  
payments. So he wants the default  backdating  to the start of his debt management plan.
NewDay said Mr D had fallen into arrears in August  2010. Because a payment arrangement 
had been put in place  in October 2010  itd delayed issuing a default notice until 2012. The 
delay had been provided to Mr D so he had the chance to clear  his balance  without  a default 
being registered. 
NewDay said Mr D offered £750 to settle the account in 2012.  And NewDay told Mr D if it 
accepted the offer then the remaining balance on his account would be defaulted.  So itd 
registered the default when Mr D had made  his last payment on 29 November 2012. 
Mr D wasnt satisfied with NewDays response. So he contacted our service  and our 
investigator looked into the matter. He felt NewDay had acted positively by freezing the 
charges and interest on Mr Ds account. But it hadnt told Mr D he was in an amended  
agreement. And it shouldve  been clear after 3-6 months of reduced  payments  that it wasnt  
a short  term issue. So he felt NewDay shouldve registered the default by April 2011. He said 
NewDay should remove the default  from Mr Ds account. And it should pay him £200 for the 
impact itd had on him.
NewDay didnt agree. It said Mr D had been made aware the default would be registered on the 
remaining balance after his settlement offer. So its asked for an ombudsmans final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see Mr D fell into arrears in August  2010  and entered into the debt management plan 
in October 2010.  The plan reduced his monthly payments. In November 2012  Mr D made an 
offer of £750 in full and final settlement which NewDay accepted.
Mr D feels NewDay  shouldve placed  a default on his account when he started  the 
management plan.  Thats what  his other  creditors did. But NewDay  didnt default his account  
until November 2012. So Mr Ds credit  file was affected for a further  two years.  
Ref: DRN41715232NewDay said it didnt register a default against  Mr D because he was keeping  up with the 
payments from his debt management plan. It said it was trying to give him a chance to repay 
his debt and avoid a default.  Mr D said he wasnt aware NewDay  was doing  anything 
different to his other creditors. But NewDay said itd made it clear that the default  would be 
entered on his account if it accepted his settlement offer. So Mr D wouldve known in 
November 2012  that a default would only be registered at the point.
I appreciate NewDay  acted sympathetically and positively towards Mr D once it became 
aware of his financial difficulties. It stopped adding further charges and interest to his 
account. And it delayed  registering  a default on his credit file to give Mr D the chance of 
sorting things out. But I would  expect  the situation  to be temporary.
When Mr D reduced  his monthly payments to NewDay he was paying  less than the minimum 
amount. So he wasnt paying as much  as hed originally agreed to. And I havent seen 
anything to suggest Mr D was sent an amended agreement. 
NewDay had to manually  alter its records each month to show  there wasnt a default despite 
the reduced payments. So I dont think it was fair to Mr D that NewDay  didnt record  the 
default by the time he was between three and six months in arrears.  By then it shouldve 
been clear he wasnt  able to make  his contractual payments. And at this point  it would be 
better for NewDay to register  the default  so that Mr D could start to rebuild his credit history 
for the future.
Allowing for the three to six month period I wouldve expected NewDay to have registered a 
default against Mr D by April 2011 at the latest. But NewDay only acted in November 2012 after 
itd received his settlement offer. So Mr Ds credit file was affected for a further 19 months.
I would expect the default to clear from Mr Ds credit history  after six years. So it shouldnt  be 
on his file anymore.  But I think its right that Mr D is compensated. By delaying the default 
Mr D was put in a worse  position that if hed not actually paid anything  after 2010. And I dont 
think thats right. Our investigator has suggested  £200 compensation for the impact this 
wouldve had on Mr D. And I think thats an appropriate amount. 
my final decision
My final decision is that NewDay should ensure the default was removed from Mr Ds credit 
file in November  2018. And it should pay Mr D £200  compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2019.
