The complaint
Mr L complains that NewDay Ltd declined his application for a credit account.
What happened
This service has previously considered a complaint about a declined application Mr L made 
for a credit account with NewDay. This complaint wasnt upheld by the Investigator, as they 
felt that NewDay hadnt acted unfairly in declining the application. However, as part of that 
complaint, NewDay said:
However, we have recently made further enhancements to our strategies and therefore Mr 
L can re-apply. 
 
We cant guarantee that Mr L will be accepted but assuming there has been no further 
material changes, the application should be approved.
Subsequently, Mr L went ahead and applied for the account again, however he has 
explained that he wasnt able to make it past the eligibility criteria, and his application was 
again rejected. I can see from Mr Ls submissions on his previous complaint that he had 
concerns about applying again, because he didnt want a declined application to show on his 
credit file. But it seems that based on what NewDay had said to Mr L, in implying the 
application should be approved, Mr L went ahead.
Mr L complained to NewDay about this again but received no response.
The Investigator requested a business file from NewDay, but it only provided its casefile for 
the previous complaint. Despite the Investigator requesting a file for this new complaint, 
NewDay hasnt responded.
The Investigator upheld Mr Ls complaint and thought that NewDay should pay Mr L £200. 
Thats because NewDay hadnt been able to provide this service with any information about 
why Mr Ls most recent application didnt meet the eligibility criteria. And the Investigator felt 
that if Mr L doesnt meet the eligibility criteria, this should have been obvious to NewDay 
from the outset, and so it shouldnt have told Mr L that his application would likely be 
approved.
Mr L accepted the Investigators view. But NewDay didnt respond at all.  The Investigator 
then went back to NewDay and explained that we would also expect NewDay to remove any 
trace of a credit search, if one happened, in relation to this second application. Again, 
NewDay didnt respond to this.
Because NewDay didnt reply to say whether it accepted the Investigators view, the 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision on the matter.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered all of the information available to me, I uphold Mr Ls complaint  for 
much of the same reasons as the Investigator.
It is disappointing to see that NewDay hasnt provided this service with any information 
relating to Mr Ls new complaint, despite requests from the Investigator for this information. 
Subsequently, I dont know why Mr Ls application didnt pass the eligibility criteria. 
Without any further information, I cant fairly say that NewDay has acted fairly or reasonably 
in declining Mr Ls most recent application. And it currently seems that the advice it gave Mr 
L to reapply for the application was either incorrect or misleading. While I accept that 
NewDay explained that it couldnt guarantee that Mr L would be accepted for the account. It 
did also say that if there hadnt been any material changes in Mr Ls situation, which Im not 
aware there has been, that the application would likely be approved  which didnt happen. 
I also accept that its possible that Mr Ls application declined for another reason  for 
example, its possible there could have been an IT issue when the application was 
processed. But because NewDay hasnt responded on this complaint at all, I cant be sure of 
what happened when Mr L made the second application. So I cant find that Mr L has been 
treated fairly.
Putting things right
To compensate Mr L for the inconvenience of applying for the account again, NewDay 
should compensate Mr L £200. It should also remove any credit searches applied to Mr Ls 
credit file relating to this second application.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold Mr Ls complaint. I order NewDay Ltd to put things 
right for Mr L by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 November 2023.
