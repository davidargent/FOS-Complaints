K820x#14complaint
Mr S says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties  my provisional  decision on 20 February 2019. A copy  of it is attached and 
it forms part of this final decision. The full background to the complaint is set out in my 
provisional decision, so I wont  reiterate it here.
I asked Mr S and QuickQuid to let me know if they had anything  else to add. QuickQuid 
confirmed it had nothing  to add and Mr S didnt respond.
my findings
Ive again considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
As neither Mr S nor QuickQuid sent me anything new to consider,  I see no reason to depart 
from my provisional findings.
So, for the same reasons  as given in my provisional  decision, Im not upholding Mr S 
complaint.
my final decision
I do not uphold  Mr S complaint against CashEuroNet  UK LLC.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 April 2019.

complaint
Mr S says CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading  as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr S had two loans with QuickQuid:
Loan  1, which commenced on 12 June 2017 and was for £200. There were two repayments  
due: £28.80 on 30 June  2017 and £249.60 on 31 July. The loan was repaid as scheduled.
Loan  2, which commenced on 10 August  2017  and was for £700. There were three  
repayments due: £94.08 on 31 August, £162.40 due on 29 September and £879.20 on 31 
October. QuickQuid says there is still an outstanding balance  on this loan.
An adjudicator considered Mr S complaint and recommended it be upheld. QuickQuid didnt agree 
with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.  
loan 1
QuickQuid asked Mr S about his income  and expenditure. It also carried out credit checks  although 
it hasnt  shown us the full result of these.
It seems that Mr S initially  declared a net monthly income of £1,650. This was amended to £1,275 on 
the same day the loan was approved. This was because QuickQuid asked Mr S for a payslip  and it 
showed this lower  figure. QuickQuid however  used the higher figure  for Mr S income when assessing 
the affordability of loan 1. Its not clear to me why this is  but as I explain below, it doesnt make a 
difference.
Mr S declared monthly living  expenses totalled £375  and I think  it was reasonable for QuickQuid to 
rely on this information for this loan. So even if QuickQuid had used the lower income figure  of 
£1,275, Mr S would still have in the region of £900 left over (after  his declared expenses) to make the 
highest repayment of £250.
I dont think it was unreasonable for QuickQuid to think loan 1 was affordable,  so Im not planning on 
upholding the complaint about it.
loan 2
For loan 2, QuickQuid did use the lower income figure of £1,275.  At this time,  Mr S declared an 
increased monthly expenditure  of £525.  This resulted  from a £100 increase in housing  costs and a 
£50 rise in other (miscellaneous) expenditure.
The highest  payment for loan 2 was £879.20  about 70% of Mr S recorded  net monthly income.  This 
is very high, even when taking into account that the loan payments were  due across three months.
In the circumstances,  I think it would have been proportionate for QuickQuid to have asked Mr S for 
further evidence to support  what he was saying about his income and outgoings.
Ref: DRN94552023QuickQuid didnt do this, so Ive considered Mr S bank statements. I appreciate this isnt necessarily 
what QuickQuid wouldve  seen, but in the absence of any other similar information, I think its 
reasonable to rely on them.
Having done this, I think QuickQuid wouldve seen that Mr S income was generally  higher than stated 
on the payslip it saw. Ive noted that Mr S referred to an incorrect tax code in his email to QuickQuid 
when he sent the payslip. On average, it seems Mr S was paid closer to £1,650 a month  as he had 
originally declared. And he was actually  paid £2,250 in August 2017. I dont know why Mr S pay was 
so much higher in this month,  but its possible Mr S tax code was adjusted, as he mentioned.
In terms of Mr S declared expenditure, his bank  statements  dont undermine  what he said about  his 
usual monthly  living costs.  The total he declared was £525 and I dont think  a proportionate review of 
Mr S usual monthly expenditure  would have caused QuickQuid to reject that figure. 
But Mr S didnt provide  any information about his monthly credit commitments  he said he didnt 
have any, and this wasnt correct. I can see he had a credit card with a £200 limit to which he made  
variable payments; an average of around £50 per month. He also had another  payday loan of £160 to 
pay in August 2017.
So I think a proportionate review of Mr S outgoings at this time wouldve caused QuickQuid to add 
around £210  to Mr S outgoings for August and around £50 per month for September and October 
2017. And QuickQuid wouldve seen  that Mr S disposable income was around £915 a month (when 
using the typical monthly income figure of £1,650) for August and £1,000 for the following months.
This means  that, whilst  I cant say QuickQuid carried out proportionate  checks, I dont think  
proportionate checks wouldve suggested the loan was unaffordable for Mr S. Im therefore not 
planning to uphold Mr S complaint about loan 2.
my provisional  decision
I do not intend  to uphold Mr S complaint against CashEuroNet UK LLC.
