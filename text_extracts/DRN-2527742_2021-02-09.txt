The complaint
Mrs A complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
Conister Bank Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality. Her husband is also involved with her 
complaint.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mrs A under a hire purchase agreement with Conister 
Bank that she signed in August 2019;
Conister Bank, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory quality will 
depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the car and the 
price that was paid for it;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car that was supplied to Mrs A was eight years old, had been driven for 27,966 
miles and had a price of £5,500;
Mrs A was concerned about the car juddering and jerking so it was inspected by a 
manufacturers dealer in September 2019 but she was told that this was normal for 
this gearbox and she paid £148.76 for the inspection (but that has been reimbursed 
to her); 
the car broke in January 2020 and a gearbox fault was identified by the recovery 
service (which recorded the cars mileage as 32,181 miles) and the car was taken to 
a gearbox specialist;
the transmission was repaired later that month and the repairs cost £2,554.91, 
£1,000 of which was covered by a warranty and the dealer contributed £500 with 
Mrs A paying the balance of £1,054.91;
Mrs A complained to Conister Banks agent and then to this service  our investigator 
thought that it was probable that there was a fault with the cars gearbox when Mrs A 
first reported it in September 2019, and that the issue worsened by the time of the 
failure in January 2020  so he didnt think that the car was of satisfactory quality at 
the point of supply and he recommended that Conister Bank should reimburse Mrs A 
for the cost of the repair;
Mrs As husband, on her behalf, says that the gearbox is too dangerous for Mrs A to 
drive so she should be able to reject the car and Conister Bank has provided a 
response from the dealer which says that the manufacturers dealer said that the 
issues reported by Mrs A were normal operation for this gearbox, she arranged the 
repair without contacting it (or Conister Bank), Mrs As driving style may be causing 
the issues and that she shouldnt be able to reject the car;
Mrs A first complained about issues with the gearbox the month after the car was 
supplied to her and in that time the car had been driven for about 1,500 miles  the 
car was inspected by a manufacturers dealer and it said that the issues about which 
shed complained were normal for this gearbox;
the gearbox then failed in January 2020, less than five months after the car had been 
supplied to Mrs A and in that time it had been driven for 4,215 miles;
I consider it to be more likely than not that there was an issue with the gearbox when 
the car was supplied to Mrs A which caused the gearbox to fail in January 2020 and, 
for that reason, I consider that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was 
supplied to Mrs A  Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
issues have been caused by Mrs A driving the car incorrectly;
the gearbox has been repaired and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that there continues to be an issue with the gearbox so Im not persuaded 
that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for Mrs A to reject the car; 
and
Mrs A paid £1,054.91 for the repair and I consider that it would be fair and 
reasonable for Conister Bank to reimburse that amount to Mrs A, with interest.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Conister Bank to pay 
£1,054.91 to Mrs A to reimburse her for the amount that she paid for the car to be repaired  
and that it should pay interest on that amount.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs As complaint in part and I order Conister Bank Limited to:
1. Pay £1,054.91 to Mrs A to reimburse her for the amount that she paid for the car to 
be repaired.
2. Pay interest on that amount at an annual rate of 8% simple from the date of payment 
by Mrs A in January 2020 to the date of settlement.
HM Revenue & Customs requires Conister Bank to deduct tax from the interest payment 
referred to at 2 above. Conister Bank must give Mrs A a certificate showing how much tax 
its deducted if she asks it for one.
.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2021.
