Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Hs complaint and thought the loans from loan 17 
onwards shouldnt have been given because the pattern of Mr Hs borrowing seemed to 
indicate he was reliant on short-term lending. Sunny disagreed but offered to uphold Mr Hs 
complaint about loan 22 onwards. Mr H declined Sunnys offer. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me. I issued my 
provisional decision in February 2020. Here's what I said: Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint. Having done so, Im thinking of partially 
upholding the complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to do more when it approved loans 1 to 17. Mr H 
didnt respond to the view. Having reviewed the complaint afresh, I think Sunny should have 
done more before it approved loans 6 onwards. But, as it stands, there appears to be no 
dispute about loans 1 to 5, so I wont be making any further findings on them.
Sunny says it carried out adequate checks before it lent loan 6 to Mr H and the results of 
these checks didnt raise any concerns. But as this was Mr Hs sixth loan in three weeks, I 
think Sunny should have been looking to build a clearer picture about Mr Hs finances before 
lending him this loan. 
Had Sunny carried out proportionate checks, its likely it wouldve seen that Mr H wasnt able 
to maintain this borrowing. At the time Mr H took out loan 6, he still had loans 1, 4, and 5 
outstanding. This meant the combined monthly repayment Mr H wouldve been paying was 
around £244 from his monthly income of £996.67. The combined repayment represented a 
significant proportion of Mr Hs income and I think Sunny ought to have realised this. As well as realising the potential for Mr H to struggle to make the repayments. Given Mr Hs income 
and borrowing, it seems there was a significant chance of Mr H having to borrow again to 
meet his commitments under this loan and the outstanding ones. I think this was shown 
when Mr H borrowed loan 7 on the same day he repaid loan 1. 
Also, I think the fact Mr H was borrowing in quick succession should have caused some 
concern to Sunny. I say this because in the space of 22 days Mr H had borrowed £950. This 
might be the sort of behaviour that would indicate someone was facing problems managing 
their money and needing to fill a gap in their finances. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Our adjudicator thought this point was reached by loan 17. Given the circumstances of      Mr 
Hs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 10. I say this because: 
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr H was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr H had taken out 10 loans in three months. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely that Mr Hs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Hs first loan was for £250 and loan 10 was for £200. At this point, Sunny ought to 
have known that it was unlikely Mr H was borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in 
his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 10 onwards Mr H was provided with a new loan within days of receiving 
his previous one.  
He also wasnt really making any inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Mr H had 
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Mr H lost out because Sunny provided borrowing for loan 10 onwards because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
The length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
 
I asked everyone to send me anything they wanted me to consider before I issued my final 
decisions.
Neither party has sent me anything more. 
my findings
Ive now reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
As no one has anything else they wanted me to consider the findings remain the same. I 
partially uphold Mr Hs complaint and I ask Sunny to put things right as Ive set out below. putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 6 to 35;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 6 to 9 from Mr Hs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 10 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 10 to 35 should be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Hs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2020.
