The complaint
Mr B complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Secure Trust Bank plc, trading as Moneyway, wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr B under a hire purchase agreement with Moneyway that he 
electronically signed in January 2020. He returned the car to the dealer because of an issue 
with the cars power and because of blue smoke coming from the exhaust. He complained to 
Moneyway about those issues in April 2020 and it arranged for the car to be inspected by an 
independent expert. 
The inspection took place in July 2020 and found that the cars diesel particulate filter 
needed to be cleaned and regenerated. Moneyway said that that was a wear and tear issue 
so it wouldnt pay for the issue to be dealt with or allow Mr B to reject the car. Mr B wasnt 
satisfied with its response so complained to this service. 
Our investigator initially said that he thought that there was a fault with the diesel particulate 
filter but he wasnt sure that it was present when the car was supplied to Mr B and that it was 
a wear and tear issue. Mr B then returned the car to the dealer for the diesel particulate filter 
to be cleaned and regenerated but the dealer then identified a fault with the cars turbo. The 
dealer replaced the cars turbo at no cost to Mr B.
Our investigator then recommended that Mr Bs complaint should be upheld. He was 
satisfied that there was a fault that was present at the point the car was supplied to Mr B but 
it was missed when the car was inspected. He recommended that Moneyway should pay 
£200 to Mr B to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that he was caused.
Mr B has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that hes still 
having trouble with the car and wants to reject it, he should receive more than £200 
compensation and hes complained about the dealer. Moneyway says that theres not 
enough evidence to show that the fault was present when the car was supplied to Mr B.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Moneyway, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr B - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car that was supplied to Mr B was more than eight years old, had been driven for 
94,000 miles and had a price of £3,500;
Mr B complained to the dealer about issues with the car soon after it was supplied to 
him and he complained to Moneyway about those issues in April 2020;
it arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert but there was a 
delay in the inspection taking place because of the government imposed restrictions 
in response to the pandemic;
the car was inspected in July 2020 and the inspection report recorded the cars 
mileage as 101,844  it recommended:   that the DPF filter is taken to a suitably 
qualified repairer for the DPF filter not only to be regenerated but to be cleaned, this 
should be classed as a routine maintenance issue not a direct result of a 
manufacturing defect  this would not impinge on the vehicle being fit for purpose at 
the point of sale as the current issues are directly attributed to a service issue;
Mr B then returned the car to the dealer for the diesel particulate filter to be cleaned 
and regenerated  but there were still issues with the car so the dealer inspected it 
again and found a fault with the turbo  it replaced the turbo at no cost to Mr B;
Mr B said that he was no longer experiencing the issues with the car but he wanted 
some compensation for the distress and inconvenience that hed been caused  our 
investigator recommended that Moneyway should pay him £200 compensation for 
that distress and inconvenience;
Mr B says that hes still having trouble with the car and wants to reject it, that he 
should receive more compensation than our investigator has recommended  and 
hes complained about the dealer;
I consider it to be more likely than not that there was a fault with the cars turbo that 
was present when the car was supplied to him and that the fault wasnt identified 
when the car was inspected because the diesel particulate filter also needed to be 
cleaned and regenerated;
I also consider it to be more likely than not that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality 
when it was supplied to Mr B  but the turbo has been replaced, the diesel particulate 
filter has been cleaned and regenerated and Mr B said that he was no longer 
experiencing the issues with the car;
I consider that the replacement turbo was an appropriate repair for the issues that 
Mr B had with the car and, although he says that hes still having trouble with the car, 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that there are any other 
faults that were present with the car when it was supplied to Mr B;
the car is more than nine years old and has been driven for more than 101,000 miles 
and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require Moneyway 
to allow Mr B to reject the car or to pay for any further repairs to the car;
Mr B has also complained about the dealer  but this service has no jurisdiction over 
the dealer and Moneyway isnt liable for the way that the dealer has responded to 
Mr Bs issues with the car; and
these events will have caused some distress and inconvenience for Mr B  but I 
agree with our investigator that it would be fair and reasonable for Moneyway to pay 
him £200 to compensate him for that distress and inconvenience  Im not persuaded 
that a higher award of compensation is justified in these circumstances or that it 
would be fair or reasonable for me to require Moneyway to take any other action in 
response to Mr Bs complaint.Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Moneyway to pay £200 to Mr B to compensate 
him for the distress and inconvenience that hes been caused.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint and I order Secure Trust Bank plc, trading as 
Moneyway, to pay him £200 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2021.
