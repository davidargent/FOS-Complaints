The complaint
Mr H is unhappy with how PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, handled his request for a 
payment reimbursement.
What happened
Mr H bought purchased an item using his PayPal account. When the item arrived it was 
damaged, so Mr H contacted PayPal to arrange a refund and returned the item to the seller. 
The seller offered a refund for the item, but Mr H needed to claim the return shipping costs 
from PayPal.
Mr H could see from the courier tracking information that the item he had sent back to the 
seller had been delivered, but PayPal werent reimbursing the shipping costs and were 
requesting tracking information from Mr H that had already been provided. PayPal did 
eventually reimburse the shipping costs, but Mr H wasnt happy with how PayPal had 
handled his case, so he made a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mr Hs complaint, but they noted that the tracking information Mr H had 
provided hadnt initially included an address to confirm that the item had been returned to the 
address of the seller, and so they didnt feel that they had acted unreasonably in chasing this 
information. So, they didnt uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Mr H wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but they also felt that PayPal hadnt acted 
unreasonably in seeking to confirm that the item had been returned to the seller. So, they 
also didnt uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Mr H remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear that Mr H feels strongly about this complaint, but having completed my review, 
PayPals position here  that they were unable to reimburse Mr H the shipping costs until 
such time that they could confirm that the item had been returned specifically to the seller  
seems reasonable to me.
Im aware that Mr H feels that the tracking information that hed provided demonstrated that 
the item had been returned to the seller, but PayPal contend that the information didnt 
include an address to allow them to confirm this point. Unfortunately, given the length of time 
that has elapsed, this information is no longer available on the couriers website, and it must 
be noted that none of the screenshots provided by Mr H provide direct confirmation of the 
address such that Im convinced that PayPal should have accepted this information as the 
confirmation that they were seeking.
So, its difficult for me to conclude that PayPal have acted unfairly or unreasonably here, 
especially considering that a condition of the reimbursement that Mr H was seeking was that 
item should be confirmed as being returned to the seller. And PayPal did ultimately 
reimburse the shipping costs, once they were satisfied that the item had been returned to the 
seller, so its clear that Mr H didnt suffer any financial loss in this instance.
It follows then that I wont be upholding this complaint or asking PayPal to take any further 
action at this time. I realise that this wont be the outcome that Mr H was wanting, but I hope 
that he can understand, based on what I have explained above, why I have made the final 
decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 April 2021.
