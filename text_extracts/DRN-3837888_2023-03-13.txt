The complaint
Miss M is unhappy that Prepay Technologies Limited trading as Prepay Solutions (Prepay) 
wont refund money she lost after falling victim to a scam.
What happened
In 2021, Miss M received a phone call from someone who she thought worked for the 
government. Miss M was told that her National Insurance number had been used for money 
laundering and her accounts would be frozen while it was investigated.  She was told to 
move her money to new accounts that had been set up. 
Miss M says she received the call while she was with her husband  who Ill refer to as A. 
And as part of the scam, they believed they needed to move money from her husbands 
accounts to her account, then onto the bank details they were given.
The following transactions were made on Miss Ms Prepay account on 20 May 2021. The 
payments in bold were made out of her account as part of the scam.

Miss M reported the scam to Prepay and asked them to refund her. But Prepay declined to 
refund her, saying shed breached the terms and conditions of her account. They accepted 
that theyd suspended Miss Ms account in error and paid her £200 in compensation and 
apologised for the error. Prepay were able to recover £2,503.15, from the beneficiary bank 
accounts - which theyve paid into Miss Ms account.
Miss M wasnt happy with Prepays response, so she brought a complaint to our service.
An investigator looked into Miss Ms complaint but didnt uphold it because:
The financial loss Miss M suffered was only for £800, with the balance of the loss 
being her husbands.  
Miss M had already been refunded £2,503.15 which was more than her loss of £800.
Prepay delayed contacting the beneficiary banks to try and recover the funds, but this 
didnt decrease the amount they could recover as most of the funds were removed 
within hours of Miss M making the payments.
Prepay were wrong to suspend Miss Ms account and shouldve fixed it sooner  but 
the £200 compensation they had paid was fair.
Miss Ms husband could set up complaints with his bank/s to attempt to recover the 
balance of the funds.
Miss M wasnt happy with the investigators response, saying its unfair were separating out 
whose money it is as they consider it to be their combined funds. She also remains unhappy 
with the customer service she received from Prepay. So, the case was passed to me to 
review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to disappoint Miss M but Ive reached the same answer as the investigator, and Ill 
explain why.
Its not in dispute that Miss M fell victim to a cruel scam, and as a result of that scam, 
forwarded money from her account to the scammer which had been transferred to 
her by her husband.
Miss M says the funds sent to the scammer were part of their joint finances. But the 
funds paid into Miss Ms account came from accounts held in her husbands name or 
in his businesss name. Miss M, her husband and her husbands business are 
considered separate legal entities by our service. Because of that, I cant consider 
her husbands financial loss in a complaint brought by Miss M against Prepay. I 
realise that this may be confusing, but I can only consider a complaint against Prepay 
about the loss suffered by their account holder  which in this case is Miss M as the 
account is held in her sole name. 
As the investigator explained, Miss Ms husband could raise complaints with the 
banks or financial institutions that hold the accounts he transferred the money from.
It wouldnt be fair for me to ask Prepay to refund Miss M for the scam payments, if 
the liability for that loss sits with another financial institution, i.e. the banks her 
husband holds his accounts with.
Based on the funds paid into Miss Ms account from her husbands accounts  her 
loss is only £800. Prepay have already credited her account with over £2,500 
(recovered from the beneficiary bank accounts), so Miss M isnt out of pocket any 
money and I cant fairly ask Prepay to refund her anything further.
Based on the evidence Ive seen, although Prepay were slow to contact the 
beneficiary banks, this didnt decrease the amount of money they were able to 
recover as the funds were moved out of those accounts shortly after they were received.
It took Prepay several months to let Miss M know whether any funds were recovered 
from the beneficiary bank accounts. This was because the beneficiary banks were 
slow to respond to Prepay. But I can see that Prepay chased them for their response 
which is what I would expect in the circumstances, so I cant fairly hold Prepay liable 
for those delays. 
Prepay accept they suspended Miss Ms account in error and have apologised for the 
mistake. Having considered everything Miss M has told us, Im satisfied that the £200 
compensation theyve already paid her is fair.
Having carefully considered everything Miss M has told us, I cant fairly ask Prepay to do 
anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint against Prepay Technologies Limited 
trading as Prepay Solutions.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 April 2023.
