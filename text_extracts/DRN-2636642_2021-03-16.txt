The complaint
Mr C is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Debenhams Mastercard, made excessive
telephone calls to him in relation to outstanding balances that he had with them.  
What happened
Mr C has five accounts with NewDay linked to five different retailers. Mr C previously raised
a complaint about all of these accounts as he felt that NewDay had offered him credit which
he couldnt afford in all five instances. This complaint was eventually referred to this service
and upheld in Mr Cs favour on 3 April 2020.
As a result, NewDay were instructed to take action which included making reimbursements
to Mr Cs accounts and removing all adverse information about these accounts from his
credit file. NewDay were asked to complete these actions within 28 days, which gave them a
deadline of 1 May 2020.
However, it was acknowledged as part of the previous complaint decision that Mr C would
be liable to repay any balances that remained on the accounts after NewDay had completed
the necessary restorative action, and that NewDay should make repayment arrangements
with Mr C regarding these balances.
In March and April 2020, Mr C received what he considers to be an excessive number of
telephone calls from NewDay in relation to the outstanding balances on these accounts. Mr
C wasnt happy about this, so he made a complaint.
NewDay looked at Mr Cs complaint, but they noted that while the previous complaint was
being reviewed by this service Mr C was still required to make his minimum payments
against the accounts, which he hadnt done. As such, NewDay felt that it was appropriate
that they had continued to try and contact Mr C about the arrears on his account, and they
noted that they had ceased all calls by 1 May 2020, which was the deadline they had been
given to complete the corrective actions on his accounts. So, they didnt uphold this aspect
of his complaint.
Mr C wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, and he was also unhappy that NewDay
hadnt taken due account that he suffered with mental health issues despite his informing
them of this previously. So, he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that the number of phone
calls that NewDay had made to Mr C was excessive, and that NewDay hadnt taken due
notice of Mr Cs mental health issues following him informing NewDay about these. So our
investigator upheld the complaint and recommended that NewDay make a payment to Mr C
of £200 as compensation for this.
Mr C didnt think that the offer of compensation recommended by our investigator went far
enough, and he thought that he should be compensated a similar amount for each of the five
accounts he held. So, the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on 17 February 2021 in which I stated the following:
Its clear that Mr C feels strongly about this complaint, and I note the emails that he 
has provided to this service which demonstrate that he mentioned his mental health 
issues to NewDay on 21 November 2019 and also on 17 April 2020.
I must begin immediately by addressing the issue of the number of calls which 
NewDay made to Mr C which he considers to be excessive. Our investigator has 
agreed with Mr Cs assessment here, but Im not convinced that the number of calls 
is excessive in this instance, especially considering the number of accounts that Mr C 
held and the fact that the majority of the calls made by NewDay went unanswered.
In our investigators view of this complaint, they noted that information provided by 
NewDay confirmed that they had made a total of 82 calls across all five accounts to 
Mr C between 14 March and 27 April 2020  which is just over a six-week period. 
This equates to approximately 14 attempted calls per week, which when considered 
as being calls relating to five different accounts equates to approximately three calls 
per week, per account.
I know that Mr C feels that the numbers provided by NewDay arent accurate and that 
more calls were attempted by them than they have a record of. However, even if I 
were to grant that NewDay made five calls per account per week to Mr C, I would still 
find it difficult to conclude that this was excessive, especially considering as how the 
large majority of the calls werent answered by Mr C, which if they had been may 
have mitigated the need for follow up calls to have been made by NewDay.
Of crucial importance here is the fact that Mr C holds five accounts with NewDay 
relating to different retailers. The overall number of attempted calls made by NewDay 
is large. However, if it were the case that each of the five accounts were 
administrated by different companies then it would be difficult to claim that any one of 
those companies was contacting Mr C excessively. Because of this, I dont feel that 
its fair to consider that NewDay have contacted Mr C excessively, given that they 
have been acting separately as administrators of Mr Cs five different accounts.
It follows then that, while I am provisionally upholding this complaint, Im not doing so 
on the basis that NewDay have contacted Mr C excessively.
Instead I am upholding this complaint for two reasons. The first being that NewDay 
didnt take due notice of Mr C informing them in at least two emails  as dated above 
 that he suffers with mental health issues.
In instances where a business is informed by a customer that they are experiencing 
mental health issues, it would be expected that the business would react positively 
and sympathetically and would listen to what the customer has to say about their 
issues before exploring what ramifications this might have for how the business might 
manage that customers account.
NewDay dont appear to have done this here, at least not at the times that Mr C firstinformed them of his mental health issues, and NewDay have confirmed that they 
didnt record that Mr C was suffering with mental health issues until he reported this 
to them again on 12 May 2020.
The second point of consideration is that, while NewDay have expressed that it was
appropriate for them to have continued to try to contact Mr C up until the deadline of 
1 May 2020 set by the outcome of the previous complaint, its difficult to conclude 
that this has led to a fair outcome here. The previous final decision gave a deadline 
of 1 May 2020 for NewDay to complete the corrective action needed on the accounts. 
However, this complaint response was issued on 3 April 2020, and it was apparent 
that from that time any contact that NewDay made with Mr C would have been 
ineffective and inappropriate.
I say this because the purpose of the calls that NewDay were making was to chase
outstanding arrears on the accounts held by Mr C. But, following 3 April 2020, both 
NewDay and Mr C became aware that corrective action was needed on these 
accounts before the true balance of the accounts would be known.
So, its hard to see what NewDay would have achieved by contacting Mr C during 
this time, because the result of any conversation that took place would surely have 
been that Mr C would have explained to NewDays staff that the balance of the 
account was under dispute because reimbursements had been instructed on these 
accounts by this service and had not yet been applied. As such, it would be expected 
that NewDay would have altered their contact strategy so as not to call Mr C while 
these corrections were being made, and so I feel that isnt reasonable or fair to Mr C 
that they continued to attempt to call him during this period.
Having reviewed this complaint, I feel that NewDay should compensate Mr C for the 
distress and inconvenience that he has suffered because of the issues I have 
detailed above. Matters of compensation are always subjective, but I feel that an 
award of £200 is an appropriate amount in this instance. So, I am provisionally 
upholding this complaint on that basis.
My provisional decision invited both Mr C and NewDay to provide any comments that they 
wished me to take into consideration before making my final decision.
NewDay confirmed that they had no further points to add. However, Mr C drew attention to 
what he believes is a misunderstanding of his complaint. 
Mr C advised that his complaint wasnt just about the amount of phone calls that NewDay 
had made, but that NewDay shouldnt have made any attempt to contact him by phone 
following this service issuing a final response on his earlier complaint. Mr C explained that 
after he received the final response from this service on 3 April 2020 which instructed 
NewDay to take corrective action regarding the outstanding balances on his accounts, Mr C 
immediately raised a dispute with NewDay about the balances outstanding.
Mr C thus believes that because the account balances were in dispute that NewDay should 
not have contacted him about these balances at all, and Mr C references several FCA 
guidelines to corroborate this claim. Additionally, Mr C doesnt accept that NewDay being 
given 30 days to implement the balance amendments in the previous final decision issued by 
this service should override the requirements to not contact him on the basis that the 
amounts were in dispute.
Id like to assure Mr C that I have understood the basis of his complaint. Indeed, I can 
confirm that that one of the reasons why I am upholding this complaint in Mr Cs favour is because NewDay continued to attempt to contact him before implementing the balance 
corrections as mandated by the previous final decision issued by this service. And this was 
explained in my provisional decision letter.
I must also note that, technically, the balances were no longer in dispute. I say this because 
the basis for calculating the balances on the accounts had been determined by the outcome 
of the prior complaint and detailed in the final decision letter from this service that related to 
that earlier complaint  which had detailed the corrective action NewDay were required to 
undertake. So, rather than being in dispute, that the balances on the accounts were incorrect 
and would remain incorrect until the corrective action that NewDay needed to undertake on 
the account balances was completed.
However, as I have explained, I am of the opinion that NewDay shouldnt have continued to 
attempt to contact Mr C before taking the necessary action to correct the account balances, 
and I will be upholding this complaint on that basis.
Mr C has also expressed his concern at the amount of compensation that I instructed in my 
provisional decision and believes that he would be awarded a larger amount if this complaint 
was treated as five separate complaints  against each account individually  and that he is 
therefore being disadvantaged that this is not the case. 
I can understand why Mr C might think this. But Ive considered the overall impact of what 
has happened here, and Im satisfied that the £200 compensation that I provisionally 
awarded represents a fair and reasonable outcome to this complaint. 
All of which means that I see no reason to deviate from the decision I provisionally arrived at 
as outlined above, and I will be upholding this complaint on that basis.
Putting things right
NewDay must make a payment to Mr C of £200 for the distress and inconvenience that he 
has incurred.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd, trading as Debenhams 
Mastercard on the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 April 2021.
