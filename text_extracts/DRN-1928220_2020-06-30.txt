The complaint
Mr Bs complained that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) blocked a payment he 
made. And that theyve not refunded the payment back to him.
What happened
In late 2018, Mr B made a trip to Cuba. He arranged this with a local resident, who charged 
Mr B US$800. Mr B used his PayPal account to send the payment. But the payment was 
blocked by the PayPal compliance department.
Mr B made alternative arrangements for the payment and requested a refund from PayPal. 
PayPal created a refund transaction, but Mr Bs money wasnt returned to his account. So he 
contacted PayPal to find out why. PayPal told him the payment was under compliance 
review.
Mr B heard nothing else so, at the end of December 2018, he complained to PayPal. When 
they replied, PayPal told Mr B that their compliance department had reviewed his account 
and identified activity which violated United States regulations. They said that, as a US 
company, they had to report this to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)  part of the 
US Treasury Department. And they couldnt refund Mr Bs money until hed got a licence 
from OFAC which allowed them to do that.
PayPal gave Mr B a link to apply for the OFAC licence, which he did. But in May 2019, 
OFAC wrote to him saying they didnt have a record of his money. OFAC said he should 
contact the bank (or, in his case, PayPal) for confirmation that theyd blocked the funds and 
had notified OFAC. 
Mr B contacted PayPal about what OFAC had said. But he didnt get a reply, so he 
complained to us. PayPal did reply after this. They confirmed to Mr B when theyd blocked 
the funds and that the details hed given OFAC were right. 
PayPal sent Mr B their final response to his complaint in October 2019. They repeated that 
they couldnt refund his money until they were authorised by OFAC  even though the 
money is still his.
I provisionally decided to uphold this complaint. I explained that I didnt think that PayPal 
were wrong to report the transaction to OFAC  US government regulations required them 
to. And the same regulations mean PayPal arent allowed to release Mr Bs money to him 
without OFACs consent. So it wouldnt be fair for me to decide they should do that.
But I did think that PayPal shouldve done more to help Mr B get his money released. It was 
him who needed to apply to OFAC for the release of his money  which he did. But when he 
needed information and guidance from PayPal, they didnt help him - they simply repeated 
what theyd told him before. And Mr B had to chase them for information, even after the matter had been escalated. I thought PayPal should pay Mr B £200 compensation for the 
frustration this caused him.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I sent Mr B and PayPal a copy of my provisional decision. Both have told me they accept it. 
So Im making my final decision for the reasons Ive summarised above.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, Im upholding Mr Bs complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCA and directing them to pay him £200 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2020.
