K821x#15complaint
Mrs K complains that British Gas Insurance Limited  is responsible for poor service in 
connection with a home emergency insurance  policy.
background
Mrs Ks company owned a redundant church building  that she planned to redevelop into 
flats. From  2014 to 2018 she had British Gas HomeCare to cover  its central  heating, 
plumbing and drainage.  
Where I refer to British Gas I refer to the insurance  company of that name  and I include its 
associated plumbing  and drainage company, engineers and others  for whose  actions I hold 
that insurance company responsible.
British Gas made some visits in 2014,  2015  and 2016. From November 2016 the policy  also 
included an annual boiler service and cover  for electrics. Mrs K agreed to pay the yearly 
premium by monthly instalments. 
In April 2017, Mrs K called for help with an electrical issue.  British Gas said it would cancel 
the policy because  the building was commercial property. A couple of days later Mrs K set 
up a new policy. In about January 2018, Mrs K called  for help with plumbing and drainage. 
British Gas sent an engineer out to unblock a sink. 
Mrs K complained that  on other occasions - British  Gas had declined  to help. In its final 
response, British  Gas said it would refund £252.02  for the payments she'd  made  from 2014 
until 2017 for the plumbing and drains  cover. 
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld.  She thought that - cover 
effectively not having  been in place for from 2014 to 2017 - British  Gas should refund all of 
the premiums Mrs K had paid. But the investigator thought the British Gas policy terms 
entitled it  on a policy cancellation - to recover £70.00 per piece of work completed. She 
recommended that British  Gas should:
1.refund  to Mrs K all the premiums she had paid to date less the cost of any jobs that 
had been completed  as per the terms and conditions; and
2.add 8% simple interest   to this; and
3.pay £100.00 compensation  for the inconvenience  Mrs K had experienced to date.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mrs K 
and to British  Gas on 24 September 2019.  I summarise my findings:
Mrs K only experienced  difficulty in the policy period from October  2016 and in the 
policy year from April 2017.  So I was minded  to find it fair and reasonable to direct 
British Gas to refund  to Mrs K the instalments she paid between October 2016 and 
April 2018.
Ref: DRN04683122As British Gas became inconsistent about  whether it would do repairs,  I wasnt 
minded to find it fair to allow a deduction for unblocking the sink in early 2018. I did 
give British Gas credit for the refund of £252.02.
As Mrs K shouldve had the larger refund some time ago, I was minded to direct 
interest at our usual  rate.
I was minded to find that  by inconsistency  in applying its policy terms from April 
2017  British Gas caused some inconvenience  and distress  to Mrs K. In particular 
she suffered wasted time in waiting for engineers and on the telephone. I was 
minded to agree with the investigator that £100.00  is fair and reasonable 
compensation for this.
Subject to any further information from Mrs K or from British Gas,  my provisional  decision 
was that I was minded to uphold this complaint  in part. I intended  to direct British  Gas 
Insurance Limited to pay Mrs K:
1.a refund (insofar as it hasnt already  paid a refund) of each instalment she paid for 
HomeCare (including central heating and plumbing  and drainage and electrical 
cover) between 7 October 2016 and 11 April 2018; and
2.simple interest at a yearly rate of 8% on each such amount it refunds from the date 
she paid it to the date of the refund. If British Gas considers that its required by HM 
Revenue & Customs to withhold  income tax from that interest, it must tell Mrs K how 
much its taken  off. It should also give her a tax deduction certificate  if she asks for 
one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate; and
3.£100.00 for distress  and inconvenience.
Mrs K disagrees with the provisional decision in part. She says, in summary, that:
British Gas knew from the start that the property was a redundant Church and they 
werent going to provide the service under the contract. 
The only service that she ever received was unblocking the kitchen sink or servicing 
the boiler. Any other job was refused. 
The refund  of £252.02 was mainly for issues before October 2016. Therefore it 
shouldnt be credited to British  Gas.
The provisional decision encourages British  Gas to continue its bad practice.
£100.00 isn't enough  compensation for numerous lengthy phone calls and waiting for 
a repairer who either didnt turn up or refused to do the repair.
British Gas disagreed  with the provisional  decision. It says, in summary, that:
Ref: DRN04683123It no longer has call recordings  or evidence from when Mrs K took out the policy  in 
October 2014.
It completed both repairs and service visits to the appliances, therefore Mrs K clearly 
had the benefit of the policy during the time she was on cover.   
It dealt with the complaint quickly.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   
British Gas hasn't provided any call recordings.
British Gas hasnt  shown us any evidence that, when Mrs K took out the policy in October 
2014, it asked  any question to which she provided  an incorrect answer.  
British Gas hasnt  provided the version  of its policy terms in use in 2014.  But Im familiar with 
later versions of its policy terms. And I accept that they cover a property that is a home  to the 
policyholder or a tenant. British Gas couldve made  that clearer. But in the context of a 
product called HomeCare Im satisfied  that its clear enough.
The British  Gas records show  that it visited the redundant  church building in October  2014.  It 
mustve realised that it wasnt anyones home. So I think it shouldve told Mrs K that the 
policy wasnt one from which she could benefit. If it had done so then I dont think she 
wouldve continued paying the instalments. Therefore I would usually find it fair to direct 
British Gas to refund  all her payments. 
In Mrs Ks case  however,  British Gas worked on the boiler anyway. In October 2015 British  
Gas did an annual boiler service. From  its records, I find that in January 2016 it replaced a 
thermocouple. I think Mrs K has forgotten about  that. And in September  2016 British Gas did 
another annual  service.
I think Mrs K renewed the policy from October  2016.  I think  the yearly premium  was going to 
be about £288.97. And I think  she mustve paid an instalment of £24.20 on about 28 October 
2016. 
From early  November 2016  she added  electrical cover. The letter said the yearly premium  
was £328.03 and she had to pay an instalment of £27.83 on 28 November followed by ten 
instalments of £27.60. Those  instalments total £303.83. Thats why I think shed paid £24.20  
on about 28 October 2016.
I think that all the previous  visits gave Mrs K a reasonable  expectation that British Gas 
wouldnt decline help on the grounds  that the building wasnt a home. I find that British  Gas 
met that expectation  until April 2017.  
On about 5 April 2017 British Gas declined to help with an electrical  issue.  It said it was 
cancelling the policy. A file note indicates  that British Gas intended to refund £141.31. I think  
that was for all the instalments paid in that policy  year to that date. But I dont  think it made 
such a refund.
Ref: DRN04683124In the absence of call recordings,  I find it likely that British Gas gave Mrs K confusing  
information about what it could cover and what it couldnt. And Mrs K took out a new policy.  
British Gas didnt  cancel it.
Matters came to a head in early 2018  when Mrs K called for help with plumbing and 
drainage. British Gas unblocked a sink in February. But on other occasions it said it wouldnt  
do a plumbing  repair  because the building  wasnt  a home. Mrs K complained  in March 2018. 
I think her policy  renewed on about  7 April 2018. 
In its final response letter  on 9 April 2018, British Gas said it was refunding  payments for the 
policy years  from October 2014, 2015 and 2016. But it quoted  figures of £74.20, £90.72 and 
£87.10 and said it was sending a cheque for the total of £252.02.  That was only for the 
plumbing and drainage  cover. 
British Gas didnt  explain why it was treating the plumbing and drainage cover differently to 
the other sections of cover such as central  heating or electrics.  I think all the sections of 
cover were  affected by the policy terms relating to a home.
Mrs K cancelled the policy on about  11 April 2018.
Ive thought about directing a refund  of all instalments  of premium  subject to a deduction 
for the work  carried  out.
But Mrs K didnt experience any difficulty in accessing  services in the policy years  from 
October 2014 and 2015. I find that British  Gas met her expectations  for those  years.
She only experienced difficulty  in the policy period from October 2016 and in the policy year 
from April 2017. So  instead of the British Gas refund  of £252.02 for plumbing and drainage 
for the policy years 2014, 2015  and 2016  - I find it fair and reasonable to direct British  Gas to 
refund to Mrs K the instalments she paid for all aspects of cover between  October  2016  and 
April 2018. 
Im increasing the refund for the period from October  2016. I find it fair and reasonable to 
give British Gas credit for the refund of £252.02.
As British Gas became inconsistent about  whether it would do repairs,  I dont find it fair to 
allow a deduction  for unblocking the sink in early 2018. 
As Mrs K shouldve had the larger refund some time ago, I will direct interest at our usual  
rate.
I find that  by inconsistency in applying  its policy terms from April 2017  British  Gas 
caused some inconvenience and distress  to Mrs K. In particular she suffered wasted time in 
waiting for engineers and on the telephone. I agree with the investigator that £100.00 is fair 
and reasonable compensation for this.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct British Gas Insurance Limited to pay Mrs K:
Ref: DRN046831251.a refund (instead of its refund of £252.02) of each instalment 
she paid for HomeCare (including central  heating and 
plumbing and drainage and electrical  cover)  between 7 
October 2016 and 11 April 2018; and
2.simple interest at a yearly rate of 8% on each such amount it 
refunds from the date she paid it to the date of the refund. If 
British Gas considers  that its required by HM Revenue & 
Customs to withhold income tax from that interest, it must tell 
Mrs K how much its taken off. It should also give her a tax 
deduction certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the 
tax from HM Revenue & Customs  if appropriate; and
3.£100.00 for distress  and inconvenience.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 November  2019.
