K822xcomplaint
Mrs M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wrongly made payments to a 
management company  acting  for the freeholder of her two buy to let properties.  She asks 
that NatWest waives interest  on the amount paid to the management  company and pays  her 
legal costs in recovering the money. 
background 
Mrs M says she wasnt told about  the amount the management company claimed was owed, 
and which  she says is incorrect. Mrs M also says she wasnt  served notices in respect of the 
court proceedings that resulted in default judgements against her or any notices before 
forfeiture. And NatWest was wrong to make  payments in excess  of the amount the court  said 
was owed. The default judgements have now been  set aside. 
Mrs M says while NatWest has accepted  it should have contacted her before making the 
payments, it hasnt done enough to put matters right. She now has to pay legal fees to 
recover the amounts  wrongly paid to the management company and says NatWest  should 
compensate her for this.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that the complaint  should  be upheld.  He said NatWest  
was entitled to pay the amount demanded as the solicitors acting for the management  
company said they were  close to withdrawing the lease. This would have  affected  NatWests 
security. While Mrs M was in dispute with the management company this wasnt  something 
we can help with. The compensation  offered  by NatWest for not contacting her before 
making the payment was fair and reasonable.
Mrs M didnt  agree. She said if NatWest had contacted  her before making the payment, 
shed have been able to point out shed made the payment.  And shed have told NatWest  
that no notices  had been served to start forfeiture proceedings.  
my provisional findings
I didnt agree with all of the adjudicators findings.  So I sent a provisional decision to the 
parties to explain why. In it, I set out the following provisional findings:
I cant comment on Mrs Ms dispute with the management company about the amount 
she owed. What I must do here is decide  whether NatWest made errors and, if so, what 
it should do to put matters  right.
what happened?
In early 2017 Mrs M made  a cheque payment of £2,932.98  to the management  
company. She sent a cover letter  saying  shed paid less than the amount  it had 
requested: she says her account was in credit  due to a previous overpayment.  The 
cheque was cashed on 2 February  2017.
In late February 2017 NatWest received  a letter from the management company about 
unpaid ground  rent of about £1,300 for one of the properties. It forwarded the letter  to 
Mrs M. Mrs M says she ignored the letter  as shed already paid the management 
company.
Ref: DRN73664812In August  2017  default judgements were issued in favour of the freeholder for £1,516.61 
(£1,446.61 debt and £70 costs)  for each property.  Mrs M says she was unaware  of this. 
In October  2017 solicitors  acting for the management company wrote  to NatWest stating 
its intention to start proceedings to forfeit the leases unless payment was made of 
£2,895.61 per property.  It enclosed  copies of notices before forfeiture. Mrs M says these 
notices were not served on her.
In November 2017 NatWest told Mrs M that it had made payments to the management 
company of £2,895.61 per property. 
did NatWest make an error?
The terms and conditions  of Mrs Ms mortgages say that NatWest can make payments 
on her behalf in respect of the properties.  Id only consider this reasonable if it genuinely 
believed its security was at risk. 
NatWest received copies  of notices before forfeiture which the solicitor acting for the 
management company  said had been  served on Mrs M. It also received copies of court 
judgements saying a debt was owed. While Mrs M says the notices werent  correctly  
served, NatWest didnt know this. On this basis, it was reasonable for NatWest to think 
there was a genuine risk to its security.
However, I think NatWest made  errors. It didnt contact Mrs M before making  the 
payment. She didnt  have an opportunity to take action  herself   either  to pay the 
amount demanded or to challenge  it.
I dont think it was reasonable  for NatWest to pay £2,895.61 per property to the 
management company  when  the default judgement was for £1,516.61 per property. 
NatWest didnt know if the management  company was entitled to ask Mrs M to pay its 
additional costs  (about £1,380 per property). NatWest had itself queried whether these 
costs were reasonable.
what should happen now?
Mrs M says this money wasnt  owed to the management company and shes taking 
legal action to recover it. If a court or tribunal  decides that the money  was owed to the 
management company  Mrs M wouldnt have  suffered any loss due to NatWests  errors. 
And if Mrs M is successful, she might be able to recover the amounts paid and some or 
all of her costs from the management  company.  As I cant at this point determine what  
Mrs Ms actual  losses are, I cant reasonably require NatWest  to pay compensation. But 
I can set out what I think should happen  if Mrs M does obtain a decision by a court or 
tribunal in her favour.
Mrs M should  provide  evidence to NatWest  such as a court  or tribunal determination  
that some  of all of the money paid by NatWest wasnt due. 
If the money  that wasnt due is refunded by the freeholder  or its agent, it should be paid 
into the mortgage account. If this money isnt refunded by the freeholder or its agent,  
NatWest would need to refund the money  to the mortgage account as at the date it was 
paid. In either case, NatWest would also need  to refund any mortgage interest that 
accrued on the amounts that shouldnt have been  paid.
Ref: DRN73664813Mrs M has also asked  that NatWest compensate her for her legal costs in recovering the 
money. If NatWest hadnt paid the amount requested by the management  company,  its 
possible the freeholder  or its agent  would have pursued a court process  and Mrs M 
would have incurred  legal  costs. I think its likely Mrs M would have incurred some legal 
costs regardless of NatWests error.  However, if the process  to prove that the money 
shouldnt have been paid costs more  than defending a case brought  by the freeholder, 
its not fair that the Mrs M has to pay the additional  amount. So if Mrs M can provide 
evidence of these  additional costs  including that shes paid the solicitors  bill  
NatWest should  compensate  her.
NatWest offered £300 compensation  for its poor service. I think, on the basis  this is for 
the upset caused by its poor service only and any financial loss will be dealt with 
separately, this is fair and reasonable.
Mrs M said she agreed with my provisional decision.  She made some comments  on my 
provisional findings:
to correct and clarify events and amounts paid or owed. In particular, that the amount of 
ground rent owed  was significantly less than £1,300;
she didnt ignore the letter from NatWest  in early 2017: she says she didnt take action 
because shed already paid the amount due;
Mrs M said that proceedings  to recover the money paid by NatWest  to the freeholders 
agent were ongoing;
her legal costs of recovery action were  now about £11,000;
NatWest should  have been aware  that the addresses on the notices were  incorrect;
as the properties were  tenanted  there would be a significant process to follow to forfeit 
the leases, so this wasnt imminent;
NatWest had no right to pay funds to the freeholders agent  without giving  her notice;
her hope is that at the end of this matter, she wont  be out of pocket.
NatWest didnt respond to my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
Im not persuaded to change my provisional  findings  or the outcome from those  set out in my 
provisional decision. While I agree that Mrs M shouldnt be out of pocket as a result of 
NatWests error, I cant at the moment determine Mrs Ms actual losses. So I cant 
reasonably require NatWest to pay compensation. 
I set out in my provisional decision what I think should happen if Mrs M obtains a decision by 
a court  or tribunal in her favour (that is, that some  or all of the money  paid by NatWest 
wasnt due). I think this is still the right approach.
Ref: DRN73664814my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order National Westminster Bank Plc to:
pay £300 to Mrs M for its poor service; and
take the steps set out above under what should  happen now if Mrs M provides 
evidence that some or all of the amount paid by NatWest  to the freeholders agent wasnt 
due.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 June  2019.
