K821x#15complaint
Mr C says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 8 high-cost short term loans. Loan  1 and loans 3 to 8 were payday  
loans. Loans 1, 6 and 7 were topped up with additional credit.  Loan  2 was a flex credit 
account. QuickQuid  provided the loans to Mr C between December 2013  and November 
2016. This is a summary of Mr Cs lending history from QuickQuid:

Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Cs complaint in part and thought the loans from loan 4 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. QuickQuid disagreed so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr C 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN07722832the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading guidance on Irresponsible Lending, and 
later the Consumer Credit  Sourcebook (CONC)  defines sustainable  as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
I agree  with the adjudicator that there was nothing to indicate  QuickQuid needed  to do more  
when it approved loans 1 to 3. So I dont think QuickQuid was wrong  to give loans 1 to 3 to 
Mr C.
Ive then looked at the overall  pattern of QuickQuids  lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
4 which  was taken  out in March 2015. I say this because:
From  loan 4 onwards  Mr C was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr C 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Cs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid. Loan  8 was 
taken out 35 months after Mr Cs first loan.  And it was for a larger amount. Mr C had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to QuickQuid over an 
extended period.
Ref: DRN07722833I think that Mr C lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from loan 4 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Cs ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 to 8 including the top ups on loans 6 and 7 and 
QuickQuid should  put things right. 
I have considered QuickQuids response  to our adjudicators view, including  its comments on 
Mr Cs repayment history; its affordability  declaration; and its external validation  of Mr Cs 
monthly credit commitments. 
But it doesnt change  my conclusion. These points do not alter my finding  that loans 4 to 8 
unfairly extended Mr Cs use of high cost short  term credit.  In addition, I think the increasing  
level of other credit  commitments  shown  in QuickQuids external  validation also evidences  
that it should have done more to check the loans were sustainably  affordable  before making 
its later lending decisions.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 4 to 8, including  the top ups on 
loans 6 and 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 4 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 4 to 8 should be removed from 
Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr C a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Cs complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) should pay Mr C compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 July 2019.
