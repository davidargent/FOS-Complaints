The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc failed to inform him when his fixed 
interest rate mortgage product on his buy to let mortgage came to an end in July 2019 which 
meant that his rate went on to NatWests Buy to Let variable rate. Mr D wants NatWest to 
allow him to take out a two-year mortgage product backdated to July 2019. 
What happened
Mr D has a mortgage with NatWest which was on a fixed rate product. In September 2018 
Mr D visited a NatWest branch to notify them he was moving to a new house. The NatWest 
adviser entered the new address on the system and said that they would be notified when 
the mortgage product ended. In July 2020 Mr D checked and discovered that his mortgage 
product ended in July 2019. NatWest confirmed that there had been a mistake and as the 
local branch had failed to update the mortgage centre of the change of address. Mr D 
discovered he had been on the variable for 11 months and says that this is the fault of 
NatWest who told him that he would be informed when the product period ended.
NatWest agreed that its mortgages department didnt have the new address, so it sent the 
reminder letters which it says is a matter of courtesy to the old address where it also sent the 
2019 annual mortgage statement. It accepted that it was at fault for this and offered £200 
compensation. But it said that it was Mr Ds responsibility to know when his interest rate is 
expiring. Our investigator accepted that the compensation was appropriate as NatWest had 
failed to update the address. Our investigator didnt recommend that NatWest should 
backdate the interest rate to compensate Mr D for the increase. In her view there was an 
onus on Mr D to keep track of his finances. Mr D disagreed saying in summary that she was 
looking at the entire sequence of events in pure hindsight without giving sufficient weight to 
the banks own processes.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr D took out this mortgage in 2010 and took out a further fixed rate mortgage product in 
June 2017. The variation agreement document showing the new mortgage product, sets out 
that the interest rate will be fixed at 1.99% until 31 August 2019 when it would transfer to 
NatWests Buy to Let variable rate. Mr D is a buy to let landlord. In 2017, NatWest effectively 
told Mr D that a major cost of this business - the interest rate on the loan - would increase in 
2019 and Mr D agreed to that.  But Mr D didnt take steps to mitigate that until 2020. Mr D 
says that he was waiting on NatWest informing him of a pending change in interest rates. 
But Mr D already knew when the interest rate would change and after it changed, his bank 
statements would have told him that the interest rate had changed. 
My view is that the variation agreement of 2017 which tells Mr D when the interest rate will 
change would be sufficient information to alert him to when it does change. I accept that 
NatWest gave him to understand that it would be in touch in advance of the change but that 
doesnt detract from the fact that Mr D would have known that date and if he wanted to avoid 
going on the Buy To Let variable rate it was his call to take the  appropriate action before the 
end of August 2019.
It seems that NatWest did as a courtesy try to remind Mr D before the interest rate changed 
although of course Mr D didnt get the reminder as its mortgage department had failed to 
record his new address. By courtesy I understand that these reminders are sent to assist 
the consumer. But, importantly, such reminders arent regulatory requirements so I cant say 
that NatWest breached any regulations. But clearly Mr D missed out on the courtesy of the 
reminders and also didnt get the mortgage statement and my view is that the compensation 
offered of £200 is appropriate for that.  Mr D has also sent in a screenshot from a NatWest 
website saying that it will contact any borrowers before the fixed rate ends. That particular 
screenshot seems to apply to personal rather than buy to let customers and so wouldnt 
apply to Mr D as it refers to personal mortgages and to going onto the SVR which is the rate 
that applies to personal customers. My understanding is that Mr Ds buy to let mortgage 
transferred to NatWests Buy to Let variable rate and not the SVR. 
NatWest has already offered the compensation referred to above. As I dont find that 
NatWest is at fault for Mr Ds failure to transfer his mortgage to a more favourable rate, I 
cant fairly uphold his complaint.   
 
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 May 2021.
