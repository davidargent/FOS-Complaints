The complaint
Mrs W is unhappy that HSBC UK Bank Plc has refused to refund all the money she lost after 
falling victim to a romance scam.
What happened
The circumstances that led to this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat 
them in detail here. But, in summary:
Mrs W was contacted by a person  who I will refer to as A - through a social media 
platform. She believed they were in a romantic relationship. After a couple of weeks, A told 
Mrs W he had a substantial amount of money in a safety deposit box and needed help from 
Mrs W to release it. Mrs W made several transfers towards the release of the box and for 
medical expenses for As son. Mrs W began giving A money on 7 July 2021 and I have
detailed the transactions within my findings below.
On 14 July 2021, Mrs W visited a branch and attempted to make a payment of £6,000.00,
but branch staff refused to make the payment as they held concerns that Mrs W was being
scammed. Within an hour Mrs W visited a second branch and withdrew £6,000 in cash.
HSBC agreed that it didnt do enough at this point and refunded this and some of Mrs Ws
later transactions.
Our investigator upheld the complaint and recommended HSBC should refund an additional
three transactions, totalling £9,200. Mrs W accepted the conclusions, but HSBC did not
agree.
I issued my provisional decision on 26 October 2023. Both parties accept my provisional 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In deciding whats fair and reasonable, Im required to take into account relevant law and 
regulations; regulatory rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and, where 
appropriate, what I consider to have been good industry practice at the time.
As neither party has provided any further evidence or arguments for consideration, I see no 
reason to depart from the conclusions set out in my provisional decision. For completeness, I 
have set this out below.
I think there has been a misunderstanding or miscalculation with the transactions that 
occurred here. Having reviewed everything  I believe the following transactions took place 
in relation to this scam.

HSBC has already upheld the transactions in yellow (the darker/greyed-out transactions are
those that were attempted and prevented). I understand £135,000 was refunded to the
customer via her representative on 25 January 2023.
So, I am looking at the four unhighlighted transactions. The CRM code only covers 
Authorised Push Payments (APPs) and does not cover cash withdrawals, card payments, 
international payments or transfers to an account in Mrs Ws own name. 
Outside of the CRM Code, a bank still has wider obligations and a duty to protect its 
customers, as far as is reasonably possible, against the risk of financial harm from fraud and 
scams. 
In broad terms, the starting position at law is that a bank is expected to process payments 
and withdrawals that a customer authorises it to make, in accordance with the Payment 
Services Regulations and the terms and conditions of the customers account. And I have 
taken that into account when deciding whats fair and reasonable in this case. However, taking into account the law, regulators rules and guidance, relevant codes of 
practice and what I consider to have been good industry practice at the time, I consider 
HSBC should fairly and reasonably: 
Have been monitoring accounts and any payments made or received to counter 
various risks, including anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, 
and preventing fraud and scams. 
Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that 
might indicate that its customers were at risk of fraud (among other things). This is 
particularly so given the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years, 
which banks are generally more familiar with than the average customer.
 
In some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, have taken 
additional steps, or made additional checks, before it processed a payment, or in 
some cases declined to make a payment altogether, to help protect customers from 
the possibility of financial harm from fraud.
For branch transactions, such as the ones on 7 and 14 July 2021, follow the Banking 
Protocol where appropriate.
 
The first transaction for £2,500 on 7 July 2021 was a cash withdrawal from a branch. It 
seems from HSBCs internal notes, staff did question Mrs W and she confirmed she hadnt 
been coerced and was adamant it was a legitimate transaction. I think the checks were 
proportionate to the sum involved here and due to the fact that the transaction didnt look 
unusual or suspicious based on the account history. So, I dont think HSBC did anything 
wrong when allowing Mrs W to make the withdrawal.
However, HSBC has agreed it should have been concerned by the time Mrs W made the 
£6,000 on 14 July 2021. I agree.
The previous day Mrs W had attempted to make the payment by her mobile banking and the 
payment was stopped for checks. HSBC was unsuccessful in contacting Mrs W over this 
payment, so it reversed it. The following day Mrs W attended a branch to try to take £6,000 
out in cash. But staff were concerned this was a scam and refused to make the payment. 
Staff noted she was vague in her answers, didnt know who the beneficiary was, and she 
had explained that she was paying on behalf of someone shed met online. A note was left 
on the account internal fraud notes indicate Mrs W was noted as being PVC  which I take 
to mean a potentially vulnerable customer). However, 40 minutes later, when Mrs W tried to 
make the same cash withdrawal at a different branch HSBC did not, by its own admission, 
do enough to prevent the scam.
This is the point at which HSBC ought to have intervened and prevented the scam. HSBC 
has accepted that. It follows that all subsequent payments would not have been made and 
therefore any further losses prevented. This means all transactions from 14 July 2021 
onwards should be refunded. This includes the card payment on 2 August 2021. The 
subsequent online warning(s) would not have been enough, in my view, to break the chain in 
causation.Putting things right
In order to put things right for Mrs W, in addition to the £135,000 HSBC has refunded, HSBC 
should: 
Refund the three transactions from 30 July 2021 to 2 August 2021 inclusive  that is £9,200.
As Mrs W has been deprived of the use of this money, HSBC should add 8% simple interest 
from the date of each transaction to the date of settlement.
If HSBC considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct income tax from 
the interest award, it should tell Mrs W how much its taken off. It should also give her a tax 
deduction certificate if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and require HSBC UK Bank Plc to put 
things right for Mrs W as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2023.
