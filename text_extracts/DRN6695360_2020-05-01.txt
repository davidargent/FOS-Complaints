K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that a hire purchase agreement with BMW Financial  Services (GB) Limited,  
under which a car was supplied to him, was mis-sold to him. 
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments (including Mr Cs detailed response 
to the investigators  recommendation) to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I agree with the conclusions  reached by 
the investigator for these reasons:
Mr C signed the hire purchase agreement and an explanations document  in August 
2016 and a new car was supplied to him;
by signing the agreement he confirmed that hed read it and it said:  This is a Hire-
Purchase agreement  regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you 
want to be legally  bound  by its terms:
he agreed to make  47 monthly  payments of £369.99 for the car, there was an 
optional final repayment of £13,330.25 and the agreement said: If you decide not to 
purchase the Vehicle at the end of this agreement,  the Option to Purchase  Fee and 
the Optional Final  Repayment will not be payable;
the agreement  also set out Mr Cs right to repay  the agreement early;
theres nothing in the agreement to show that BMW Financial Services  guaranteed  a 
minimum future value of the car or that Mr C would have  equity in the car;
he has described in detail the discussions that took place with the dealer before he 
signed the agreement but theres no written  record from that time, other than the 
agreement and the explanations document, to show what  was discussed;
I consider that the agreement clearly sets out the basis on which the car was being 
supplied to Mr C and that its reasonable to expect that he wouldnt  have  signed  the 
agreement if it didnt  properly set out the terms that he understood to have  been  
agreed;
its clear that the agreement was a hire purchase  agreement and it was Mr Cs 
decision to sign it and for the car to be supplied  to him on that basis - rather than to 
hire a used car as he said hed intended to do;
Im not persuaded that theres enough  evidence to show  that the agreement  was mis-
sold to Mr C or that BMW Financial Services has acted incorrectly  in connection with 
the agreement   so I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require BMW  
Financial Services: to allow Mr C to reject  the car; to refund to him any of the 
payments that hes made for the car; or to take any other action  in response to his 
complaint; and
Ref: DRN66953602Mr C has complained  about the way that the dealer has dealt with his complaint  but 
that isnt something  that this service can consider  or something  for which  BMW 
Financial Services would  be responsible.
my final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Mr Cs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 June 2020.
