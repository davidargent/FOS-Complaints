The complaint
Mr E complains about a missing payment due into his account with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et 
Cie SCA (PayPal).
What happened
Mr E sold an item through a third-party selling website and used his PayPal account to 
receive the funds. The buyer opened a goods not received case and the dispute was upheld 
in their favour. This meant the payment was taken from Mr Es PayPal account and returned 
to the buyer. A day later the goods arrived, and Mr E says the dispute was reversed but the 
money never arrived back into his PayPal account. 
Mr E has now complained to PayPal as he says he hasnt received the money. 
PayPal looked into the complaint but didnt uphold it. It run several searches on Mr Es 
account and evidenced that the money hadnt been received from the third-party website. 
Mr E remined unhappy, so he brought a complaint our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint but didnt think it should be upheld. Our 
investigator said it was clear from the evidence PayPal provided that the money hadnt been 
received into the account. He went on to say that PayPal had done everything it could to 
locate the funds, but as they were not received from the third party, there was no more it 
could do. 
Mr E didnt agree with the investigators view, so its been passed to me to issue a final 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator, for largely the same 
reasons. Ill explain why.
The sale of the goods and the buyer dispute were both through the third-party website and 
not PayPal, so PayPals involvement in this complaint was only as the account the money 
shouldve come back to. 
PayPal have supplied evidence that shows its done a thorough search on Mr Es account 
going back to the day of the refund, and no money has been received into Mr Es PayPal 
account from the third-party website or the buyer. In these circumstances, Im satisfied 
PayPal have done enough to try and locate the missing funds. Mr Es complaint should be 
now be directed to the source of the funds. 
Its also clear from Mr Es testimony that he has had a lot of issues with the third-party 
website and inconsistent information regarding where the payment went. This further 
satisfies me that the issue is most likely with the third party rather than PayPal. Mr E did 
originally ask that the investigation of this complaint was directed the third-party website, but 
our investigator has correctly pointed out that we are unable to investigate that as part of this 
complaint. 
I can see from Mr Es testimony that when the third-party website asked PayPal for 
information to enable it to locate the payment, this was provided. This is what we would 
expect PayPal do in these circumstances. 
In summary, based on the evidence Ive seen from both parties, I havent found PayPal have 
acted unfairly or done anything wrong in the circumstances of this complaint. 
My advice would be to go back to the third-party website and log a formal complaint. PayPal 
have also said it can investigate the issue again if Mr E can provide a valid payment 
transaction ID. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 June 2022.
