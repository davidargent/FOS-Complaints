The complaint
Miss O is unhappy that NewDay Ltd sent her account to a debt collection agency and 
recorded a default against her credit file.  
What happened
Miss O had a credit card administered by NewDay which had a credit limit of £3,000. The 
credit card benefited from a 0% interest rate which was applicable to the balance transferred 
to the card by Miss O when she took it out, and which was conditional on Miss O maintaining 
the card below the agreed credit limit.
In November 2019 Miss O took the card over the agreed credit limit. Miss O contacted 
NewDay and arranged to make a payment to bring the account under the agreed credit limit, 
and NewDay agreed to reinstate the 0% interest promotional offer. In addition, NewDay 
agreed to refund fees that had accrued on the card because the credit limit had been 
exceeded and advised Miss O to wait until these refunds had taken place before making the 
agreed corrective payment on the account. NewDay also told Miss O that she wouldnt have 
to make a monthly payment against the account in December because the refunds she 
would receive would cover the required amount.
In December 2019 Miss O made a complaint to NewDay because the refunds she had been 
promised on her account had still not taken place and because of this the card was still over 
the agreed credit limit.
In January and February 2020, with NewDays complaint investigation still ongoing, Miss O 
sent a series of emails to NewDay chasing a resolution to the ongoing issues with her 
account. 
On 28 January 2020 NewDay sent a notice of default to Miss O as no payment had been 
made against the account since 18 November 2019. The notice gave Miss O until 19 
February to make the outstanding contractual minimum payments, which at that time totalled 
approximately £190. 
On 22 February 2020, because no payment had been received on the account, NewDay 
issued a notice of termination to Miss O. However, as mentioned above, Miss O was 
attempting to contact NewDay at this time and sent emails to NewDay dated 9 January, 21 
January, 12 February, and 14 February 2020.
On 5 March 2020, NewDay passed Miss Os account to a debt collection agency and issued 
a final response letter to the complaint that Miss O had raised in November 2019. In their 
response, NewDay upheld Miss Os complaint as they agreed that Miss O had been given 
incorrect information about the details of the 0% interest promotional offer on her card, and 
also that she had been wrongly informed that she wouldnt need to make a payment against 
the account in December, when in fact this had been required.
Miss O complained to NewDay. She didnt fee that it was fair that they had passed her 
account to a debt collection agency and recorded a default against her credit file while her 
complaint was ongoing and considering that NewDay had told her that she didnt need to 
make the account payment for December. Miss O was also unhappy that NewDay had taken 
this action even though she had attempted to contact them via email on four separate 
occasions.
NewDay looked at Miss Os complaint, but they noted that Miss O had not made a payment 
on the account since 18 November 2019, and so they felt that they had acted appropriately 
and didnt uphold Miss Os complaint.
Miss O remained unhappy, so she referred her complaint to this service. One of 
investigators looked at this case. They felt that, because Miss O had been actively trying to 
contact NewDay via email, and because she had been told by NewDay to not make a 
payment until the refunds she was promised took place, and also that she wouldnt need to 
make a December payment against the account, that NewDay hadnt treated Miss O fairly in 
passing her account to a debt collection agency and recording a default on her credit file. 
So, our investigator recommended that NewDay remove all adverse information relating to 
this account from Miss Os credit file and that NewDay should recall the account from the 
debt collection agency so that Miss O can make payments to her account in line with the 
original credit agreement. Finally, our investigator said that NewDay should pay £100 to Miss 
O to compensate her for the distress and inconvenience this matter had caused.
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendations put forward by our investigator and so the 
matter was escalated for an ombudsman to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In doing so Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator, for essentially the same 
reasons.
I accept that Miss O didnt make any payment against the account in the period from 18 
November 2019 to when the account was passed to a debt collection agency on 5 March 
2020, but I feel that there are mitigating circumstances as to why this was the case.
For instance, Miss O was told by NewDay to wait until the refunds she was expecting were 
credited to her account before making the payment to bring the account back within the 
agreed credit limit. Miss O was also told by NewDay that she wouldnt need to make a 
monthly minimum payment against the account for December, as NewDay acknowledge in 
their complaint final response letter.
In their correspondence with our investigator, NewDay explain that the default notice sent to 
Miss O on 28 January 2020 was a regulatory requirement and had to be sent by them 
because no payment had been received on the account for two months. However, there is 
no such regulatory requirement that a default notice must be sent if an account falls two 
months into arrears. 
It is a regulatory requirement that a company must send a customer a default notice if that 
company chooses to begin default proceedings against that customer, but it is at the 
discretion of the company to decide when it is appropriate for such proceedings to 
commence.
The Information Commissioners Office publishes guidance which recommends that the action of issuing a default notice be considered by a company when an account has fallen 
between three and six months into arrears. While this is only guidance, I highlight it here to 
demonstrate that there was no requirement that NewDay issue a default notice to Miss O 
when her account was two months in arrears. 
It is also the case that one of the two payments which Miss O was in arrears at the time that 
NewDay issued the notice of default was the December 2019 payment, which NewDay had 
themselves told Miss O that she didnt need to make. 
Furthermore, its apparent from the emails that Miss O sent that she was actively trying to 
contact NewDay to arrange a resolution to the ongoing issue. NewDay have explained that 
these emails were sent by Miss O to their complaints department which attached them to 
Miss Os complaint and that they were not made available to staff from other departments or 
recorded against her general account.
But it seems to me that whats important here is that Miss O did attempt to contact NewDay 
by email, and that NewDay did receive the emails that Miss O sent. It may be the case that 
NewDay didnt disseminate the contents of those emails effectively between their different 
internal departments, but this isnt something I can reasonably hold Miss O accountable for.
NewDay have also said that they would have expected Miss O to contact them via other 
channels once she realised that her emails werent being responded to, but Im not 
convinced of the validity of this argument, especially considering that NewDay dont seem to 
have attempted to contact Miss O by any other channels when their letters werent being 
responded to. 
Its also notable that Miss O had an outstanding complaint against NewDay which would 
ultimately be found in her favour at the time that NewDay began default proceedings against 
her. Whilst it is at the discretion of a business whether or not suspend collections activity 
while a complaint is ongoing, there may be instances where not doing so leads to an unfair 
outcome for the customer, and I think that thats the case here. 
I say this because the complaint response was issued by NewDay on the same day that they 
transferred the account to a debt collection agency, and because the nature of the complaint 
was such that if a response had been issued sooner by NewDay, this may have contributed 
to Miss O making the necessary repayments required by NewDay to avoid the account being 
transferred as such.
And so, considering the key points that I have outlined above, I cant reasonably conclude 
that NewDay have acted fairly toward Miss O in recording a default against her credit file and 
in transferring her account to a debt collection agency in the way that they have.
It follows then that Im in agreement with the view put forward by our investigator, and I will 
be upholding Miss Os complaint on that basis.
Putting things right
To put things right, NewDay Ltd should recall this account from the debt collection agency 
and allow Miss O the opportunity, if still required, to make an arrangement to bring the 
account under the agreed credit limit so that it may continue on the original contractual 
terms.
NewDay have explained that their internal systems may make it difficult for the original 
contractual terms to be reinstated. This does not effect the spirit of my decision, and it is left 
to the discretion of NewDay whether they need to offer repayment terms to Miss O that differ from the original contractual terms in order to fulfil the obligation of recalling the account from 
the debt collection agency, so long as any difference in terms is in Miss Os favour.
NewDay Ltd should also remove all adverse information from Miss Os credit file relating to 
this account and should pay £100 compensation to Miss O for the distress and 
inconvenience caused.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd on the basis outlined 
above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss O to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 March 2021.
