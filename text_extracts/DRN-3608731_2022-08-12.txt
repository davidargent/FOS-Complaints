The complaint
Miss K complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc hasnt refunded a payment to her account and 
has provided poor service.
What happened
Miss K says that a payment for £123.73 to a merchant was taken from her account. It wasnt 
returned to her. She says that the merchant separately took £92.23. And she received 
notification on 20 May 2021 that her account was overdrawn and made a transfer from her 
savings account to cover this. She is unhappy because HSBC hasnt addressed the issue 
and a member of staff was rude to her.
HSBC said that it couldnt find the payment of £123.73 had debited Miss Ks account. And it 
paid her £50 for the issues she had experienced with online banking.
Our investigator didnt recommend that HSBC do anything further. The initial amount of 
£123.73 had been a pending payment which affected the available balance on the account. 
The actual amount of £92.23 had been taken and the pending amount was removed. She 
couldnt see that Miss K would have been overdrawn on 20 May 2021 if she hadnt made the 
transfer. Our investigator had listened to calls with HSBC and didnt think that Miss K was 
dealt with rudely. She thought that the £50 reflected any inconvenience caused.
Miss K didnt agree and wanted her complaint to be reviewed. There was money missing 
from her account and it had been overdrawn. The compensation isnt fair and only reflected 
what happened up to the complaint being raised. There had been subsequent issues. She 
said she hadnt been listened to by HSBC and this was rude treatment and poor service. 
And the dispute about the payment was incorrectly closed by HSBC.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand the dispute here and Miss K had been very consistent in what she has said and 
genuinely believes she has lost money.
I want to set out some points which I think are agreed first before I say what I think about 
what happened:
18 May 2021: Miss K orders goods for £123.73  from the merchant. 
20 May 2021: The merchant debits her account with £92.23 as one item isnt in stock.
20 May 2021: Miss K credits the account with £110 from her savings. The closing account 
balance shown on the statement that day as in credit by £146.77.
25 May 2021: Miss K speaks with at least two members of staff (she refers to an earlier call, 
but this hasnt been identified by HSBC).
1 June 2021: The merchant debits the other £31.50.
7 June 2021: Miss K receives a refund from the same merchant for £51.75
5 July 2021:  HSBC pays Miss K £50 compensation
21 July 2021: HSBC writes to Miss K to say it has raised a dispute about the transaction.
24 August 2021: HSBC writes to say the dispute is resolved because of the £51.75 refund.
HSBC hasnt been able to provide information about what the available balances were 
during this time. It is agreed that for a period the £123.73 authorisation was showing as a 
pending payment which would reduce the available balance on the account. Miss K is 
adamant that she received information from HSBC that on 20 May 2021 there was an 
overdrawn position of £108 on her account. And thats why she transferred £110 to cover 
this. I dont have reason to doubt that she saw this information during that day but as set out 
above at the end of that day the statement balance was £146.77 in credit. 
I think part of the issue here is that the merchant didnt take all of the amount Miss K had 
authorised at once. I think its possible that the pending payment and actual debited amount 
were at one point during 20 May 2021 showing on her account. Miss K refers to speaking to 
the merchant that day about what happened. When Miss K spoke to HSBC on 25 May 2021 
it seems to be agreed that there was by then no pending payment then showing.
I need to use Miss Ks account statement as the evidence of the actual payments that were 
debited and credited to her account. There is no debit for a single payment of £123.73. The 
amounts of £92.23 and £31.50 were the sole debit of the authorised amount. There was a 
partial refund of £51.75 which I understand was related to an item returned by Miss K. There 
is no duplicated payment and so no basis to refund £123.73 as Miss K wants. I know she will 
be very disappointed by my conclusion here.
This means that I wouldnt have expected HSBC to need to raise a dispute. My 
understanding of what subsequently happened is that it disputed the actual payments of 
£92.23 and £31.50. And having not identified a valid reason for raising a chargeback of 
these amounts it considered that the merchants refund of £51.75 resolved things. I 
appreciate that this wasnt the outcome Miss K wanted. But again, I dont see that there was 
a valid reason to dispute this payment. 
I understand Miss K felt she wasnt being listened to by HSBC when she called. I have the 
call recordings and consider she was given the correct information about what happened. 
That was counter to what she believed. So, I can see why she was frustrated. I wouldnt 
though agree that HSBC was rude to her and provided poor service. She was given the 
explanation Ive set out here. And so, I dont have a basis to require HSBC to do anything 
further.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 September 2022.
