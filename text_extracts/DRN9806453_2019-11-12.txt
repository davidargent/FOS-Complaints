K820x#14complaint
Mr B is unhappy with the amount of compensation Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds)  has offered to 
settle his complaint about a mis-sold payment protection  insurance (PPI) policy  taken out 
alongside a credit card.
background
In November 1995 Mr B opened a credit card account with Lloyds Bank  PLC, and was 
issued with two separate  cards, one ending 6232 (later  card ending 6383) and the other card 
ending 6703. 
In 2019 Mr B complained to Lloyds that he had been  mis-sold PPI with his cards. In 
February 2019 Lloyds  wrote to Mr B and said it wasnt  upholding his complaint that the PPI 
had been mis-sold. But it said he was owed some excess commission  that had been paid as 
part of the costs of the PPI hed been  charged. So it offered him £114.52 after tax to refund 
this excess commission.
Mr B wasnt  happy with what Lloyds said and brought  his complaint to this service.  
Lloyds reviewed what it had said and then agreed  it would  uphold Mr Bs complaint the PPI 
was mis-sold. In addition  to the £114.52 it had paid it offered an additional  £64.97 after tax 
as it said this would then refund the total costs of the PPI plus compensation for being out of 
pocket for all the costs.  
Our adjudicator said what Lloyds had now offered in compensation was fair. Mr B still wasnt  
happy as he said hed been paying the PPI for much  longer than Lloyds had worked out. So 
he asked for an ombudsman to look into his complaint.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Lloyds has now agreed to uphold the complaint  that a PPI policy associated with one of the 
cards was mis-sold  and it has offered to pay Mr B compensation. So in this decision Im not 
looking at how the PPI came to be mis-sold.  Im only looking at whether Lloyds has offered 
fair compensation to settle  the complaint.
Mr B has been unable to find any statements or paperwork  relating to his credit  cards.  
Lloyds said the account was opened  in 1995 and two credit  cards were taken out but that it 
only had statements for each card from January 2000. It has eventually provided the credit 
card statements for the two cards from January 2000. There are no charges shown for PPI 
on card ending 6282 (6383) on any of the statements.  Therefore there  is nothing  to show 
that PPI was ever taken  out and charged  on this credit card.  Other records  from Lloyds also 
indicate there was no PPI associated with this card.
For credit  card ending 6703  there are no PPI payments shown on the statements in January 
2000 when actual statements are first available. But in June  2003  a charge for PPI is shown. 
And then charges for PPI are shown on the statements until April 2008,  in the months  when 
Ref: DRN98064532there is a balance on the account. The balance on this credit card was also fairly  low as the 
credit limit is shown as £250.
Taking into account all the records provided by Lloyds Im satisfied that there was no PPI 
charges made to credit card 6282 (6383) after January 2000. And based on the evidence I 
think it most likely no PPI policy  was charged before January 2000. So I dont think  there 
was ever any PPI ever associated with this credit card, from the date the card opened  in 
1995.
Looking at card ending 6703 I think the evidence is clear some PPI charges  were made 
during the period from 2003 to 2008. But it is most likely no PPI was added before 2000  as 
there is no PPI showing on the statements from January 2000 until June 2003. So there is 
nothing to indicate PPI may have been  charged to the card before the records start in 2000.  
I have then looked at the calculation Lloyds has made to work out what Mr B actually paid for 
the PPI whilst it was active on the account.  Lloyds has statements showing the premiums 
and interest rates and I can see from its calculations that it has used these  to work out the 
costs of the PPI. It has also worked  out some  compensatory interest for periods when Mr B 
would have repaid all the PPI cost by clearing  his balance  and was out of pocket.
In total the costs of the PPI, including card rate interest and compensatory  interest, comes to 
£179.48 after tax. The premiums paid by Mr B are not large  as the credit limit on the card 
account was low, so the balance was always quite low and there were periods that I can see 
when there  was no balance on the account  at all.
Therefore I think the offer that Lloyds has made to settle the complaint is fair. It did pay part 
of this, £114.52, when it originally said only excess commission should  be refunded. But it 
has now offered the additional amount of £64.97 so that all the costs of the PPI, plus some 
compensatory interest,  are repaid to Mr B.
my final decision
For the reasons  I have  set out above I think what Lloyds Bank PLC has offered  in 
compensation for the mis-sold PPI with Mr Bs credit card is fair.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 December  2019.
