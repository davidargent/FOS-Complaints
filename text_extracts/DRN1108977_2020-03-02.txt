K820x#14complaint
Mr Ms complaint against NewDay  Ltd (NewDay) concerns how it handled his account when 
it knew he was going through difficulties.
background
Mr M had a loan with NewDay. In 2017 he made  it aware he was having some  heath 
difficulties which affected his work and income. Attempts were made to agree repayment 
plans, and for interest and charges to be put on hold,  but each of these  failed. This meant  
that Mr Ms loan was defaulted and sent to a debt collection agency.
Mr M was unhappy with how NewDay had treated him. Specifically, he explained hed told it 
about his difficulties in 2017, but until our service became involved it didnt acknowledge this 
was the case.  He found this disingenuous and upsetting. He also said it wasnt true that 
NewDay had tried to help him. He said he himself made most of the contact, and had tried to 
set up payment plans.  He also said hed paid over Â£1,000 in interest on his account, and 
didnt think this was fair. 
To resolve  matters, he wanted his remaining balance to be written-off  and for any adverse 
entries to be removed from his credit  file. 
NewDay didnt uphold  his complaint. It showed  us the repeated  contact it had had with Mr M, 
including attempts to agree repayment plans, and then making  him aware  of the 
consequences of not sticking to these.  Mr M had been offered a six-month repayment plan, 
but had called back in the first month asking for it to be cancelled. It said it didnt agree it had 
treated Mr M unfairly. It felt it had done  everything that could reasonably  have been 
expected. 
As matters couldnt be resolved, Mr M brought his complaint to our service.
Our Investigator  looked  into matters, and while she sympathised with Mr Ms circumstances, 
she couldnt  agree  that NewDay had made mistakes with his account, or treated him 
unfairly. 
Mr M didnt  agree. He maintained that NewDay had treated him poorly, and hadnt  tried to 
help him. He asked  for an ombudsmans review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im in agreement with our Investigator that theres not enough evidence  to 
convince me that NewDay treated  Mr M unfairly, and specifically that it failed to help him 
when he was in difficulties. 
I know my decision will be disappointing for Mr M. Id like to say Im genuinely  sorry for what  
hes gone through, and I do understand that worrying about his NewDay account would only 
have added to his troubles. But thats  not the same  as saying  that NewDay  acted incorrectly 
or badly  towards  him. 
Ref: DRN11089772Ive looked at all the evidence, and I can see that NewDay did contact Mr M on numerous 
occasions to discuss his circumstances, and try to help him. Its also explained that when  a 
repayment arrangement  is agreed, but then the first repayment isnt made, the account falls 
back to being  interest  bearing, and charges would be applied.  And Mr M was made aware of 
this. While its unfortunate that Mr M wasnt able to fulfil the repayment plans (and this may 
well be for good reason), I cant criticise NewDay for what then happened.  I can see it tried 
in good faith to reach reasonable and affordable plans, and that Mr M agreed.  When the 
plans didnt then succeed, I cant say it was unreasonable  for what  happened  to the account 
next. Im satisfied that Mr M was aware  of the consequences, and that NewDay  was entitled 
under the terms  and conditions to do what it did. 
Mr Ms particularly  unhappy that NewDay initially denied being  informed about his health and 
financial difficulties in 2017, only to later admit  that it did actually know about them. I can see 
why this will have hurt and offended  Mr M. But I havent seen evidence to suggest that this 
was anything other than an honest mistake, with no malice or harm intended. Further,  I dont 
think this had a bearing on what MewDay  offered  to do for Mr M at the time,  so I cant  say 
there was a financial impact on him. As such,  I dont think  it would be a proportionate 
response to ask NewDay to clear  Mr Ms remaining balance, or remove  the loan from his 
credit file. 
Overall, I cant say that NewDay failed to try to help Mr M, or treated him unfairly.  I think it 
did what it could at the material times, with the information it had. Lenders have a duty to 
treat customers in difficulties positively  and sympathetically. And I hope and expect thats 
what NewDay will continue  to do here.  I do appreciate that Mr Ms had a difficult experience  
with NewDay, but I cant  fairly say it was all NewDays  responsibility. I think it did what  it 
could when it could.  I think other  factors stopped the repayment plans from succeeding.
I have to reach an outcome in this complaint thats fair to both  parties. Asking for the 
balance of Mr Ms loan to be written-off  wouldnt  be fair. He benefited from the money, and 
failed to adhere to the terms of repaying it. It also wouldnt be fair for me to ask NewDay to 
remove the loan from Mr Ms credit file. This is because whats been  recorded there is a true 
and accurate representation of how the accounts been managed. And NewDays  obliged  to 
report in this manner.
While Im sorry to hear whats happened to Mr M, I dont  have  the evidence  to say NewDays 
treated him unfairly, and so Im not going to ask it to take any further steps to resolve this 
complaint. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 April 2020.
