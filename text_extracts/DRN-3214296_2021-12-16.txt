The complaint
Mr M complains that Retail Money Market Ltd trading as RateSetter failed to transfer his 
funds within the timeframe given.
What happened
On 4 April 2021, Mr M logged onto his RateSetter account to request a transfer of his funds 
into his bank account. But two days later, the funds hadnt transferred, and he was 
concerned regarding the whereabouts of his money. So he called RateSetter to find out what 
had happened. 
RateSetter said it was experiencing technical issues, and that the funds would be in Mr Ms 
account by 6pm that day. When this didnt happen, he called again the following day and 
was told the same thing. But the money didnt transfer into his account until 8 April 2021.
Mr M raised a complaint. He said he was worried and anxious about where his money had 
gone, and RateSetter werent helpful or reassuring during this time. Instead, he was given 
incorrect time frames of when the issue would be resolved. As RateSetter didnt uphold the 
complaint, Mr M has brought it to our service.
RateSetter has told us that there was a technical issue outside of its control. Its provided us 
with emails sent to Mr M on 7 and 8 April 2021 explaining this. It has also provided the call 
recordings from 6 and 7 April 2021 where its advisor explains this to Mr M. 
Based on this, our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. She was satisfied RateSetter had 
done enough to keep Mr M updated and as the technical problems were down to a third-
party, she didnt recommend that RateSetter do anything further to resolve the complaint. 
As Mr M didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate Mr Ms strength of feeling regarding this complaint. I have no doubt that he 
wouldve been worried about his money when it didnt appear in his account after two days. 
But to be able to uphold this complaint, I need to be satisfied that RateSetter did something 
wrong and that this led to unnecessary distress and inconvenience. 
From the information I have available, RateSetter experienced delays in processing many 
customers transfers due to a technical issue with its payment processing provider. As this 
was outside of RateSetters control, I cant fairly say it did anything wrong here. But Ive also 
thought about how RateSetter handled this situation, and whether it treated Mr M fairly whilst 
the problem was rectified. 
I can see that RateSetter contacted all of its customers, including Mr M, by email to make 
them aware of the delay. Im also aware that Mr M called RateSetter on two occasions and 
was told about the technical issues. So Im satisfied that any anxiety about his money being 
lost had been resolved at this point, as RateSetter had provided a clear explanation of why it 
wasnt in his account. 
RateSetter did tell Mr M that the problem would be resolved that day, on two occasions  but 
it wasnt. I think more couldve been done to manage his expectations. But Im mindful that 
Mr M had the money in his account by 8 April 2021, which is only two days later than he 
originally anticipated. As such, I think the impact on Mr M was minimal. 
I think its important to explain that our role is to bring complaints to a fair and reasonable 
resolution. Were not a regulator and any award of compensation we make isnt intended to 
fine or punish a business. 
Sometimes things go wrong and inevitably this may cause a customer some distress and 
inconvenience. This doesnt mean the customer must be compensated in all circumstances. 
Instead, well look at the impact any errors had. 
In Mr Ms case, Im satisfied RateSetter treated him fairly by providing updates. And whilst 
this took longer to resolve than Mr M was led to believe, he had the money in his account 
four days after the transfer was requested. So Im not persuaded that the impact on Mr M 
was to the extent that compensation is warranted.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 January 2022.
