K822xcomplaint
Mr S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc continued to send post for his ex-partner 
to his current address  despite him asking  them not to. Debt agencies who worked  with 
NatWest also used  his current  address for his ex-partner.  
Mr S said that this has caused problems with his current partner. He wants  NatWest and the 
debt agencies to stop sending post for his ex-partner to him. He also wants  compensation 
for the distress and inconvenience caused  to him by NatWests mistake.
background 
Mr S says that he split up with his ex-partner around  12 years ago. He had a joint loan with 
her. He says that he has been  paying  this off but that she hasnt made any contributions 
towards it. 
Mr S says that for around several years, when he changes his address, he tells NatWest. It 
seems that they then also change the address for his ex-partner to his new address. This 
results in NatWest and the debt agencies that they work with sending post for his ex-partner 
to Mr Ss new address.  
Mr S says that he has complained to NatWest at least four times about this. 
Mr S raised a complaint towards  the start of 2018 as he was getting  post for his ex-partner at 
his address. This address  was his current partners address. Having his ex-partners post 
being delivered here was putting a strain on his relationship. Mr S says he was getting to the 
post before  his partner so that he could hide any letters for his ex-partner. He says he didnt 
enjoy having to be deceitful.  
In February 2018,  NatWest told him that they would try to trace  his ex-partners address so 
that they could  send  her post to her. They  said that they couldnt promise that this would 
happen, but that they would try. They paid Mr S £100 compensation for the distress and 
inconvenience caused to him. They also paid him £25 for poor service. 
Mr S hoped that the matter had been resolved  but, in October 2018, he started to receive 
post from NatWest and debt agencies, again,  addressed to his ex-partner. 
NatWest found that they had updated Mr Ss ex-partners address to his address  incorrectly  
in September  2018. 
Mr S brought his complaint to us. 
He says he also started to get calls from debt agencies for his ex-partner. 
Our investigator found that NatWest had sent Mr Ss ex-partners post to his current address. 
This post was not only for the joint loan that Mr S held with his ex-partner, but also for a loan 
in her sole name. 
NatWest agreed to change the address for his ex-partner back to a previous address that 
they held for her. They  also said that they would tell the debt agencies  of this change  of 
address.
Ref: DRN71493942The investigator also thought that NatWest should  pay Mr S a further £150 for the distress 
and inconvenience  caused to him. 
Mr S wasnt  happy with this outcome. He didnt  believe  that NatWest  would stop sending  his 
ex-partners post to him. He thought  that the only way to deal with this was to legally remove 
his name  from the loan and pursue his ex-partner for the balance. 
Our investigator explained that he couldnt  ask NatWest to do this.
Mr S then asked for compensation  of £1,500 instead of £150.  Our investigator didnt agree 
so the complaint has now come to me. 
Since then,  Mr S has received post for his ex-partner  from one of the debt agencies  that 
NatWest use.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im afraid that Mr S wont be happy  with my decision. I think  that £150 compensation is fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances. I will explain why. 
I do sympathise with Mr S having gone  through  the same thing with NatWest a number of 
times. But I also think that NatWest is trying  to put things right. Because of time limits that 
apply to this complaint, I can only look at what has happened since  February 2018. 
At this point, NatWest said that they would  try to trace  Mr Ss ex-partners address but that 
there was no guarantee that they could do this. 
When Mr S started to get post for his ex-partner again in October 2018, I do think  that it was 
NatWests fault as they had incorrectly changed  the address for his ex-partner to Mr Ss 
current address. 
I think that £150 compensation is fair and reasonable  for the mistake  that NatWest  made in 
changing the address. The Financial Ombudsman  Service isnt here to punish  a business. 
We try to reach a fair and reasonable  outcome in the complaints  that we look at. 
NatWest has agreed that they will change Mr Ss ex-partners address to one that they 
previously held for her. I believe that this will be done. 
I note that Mr S has received a further letter addressed to his ex-partner at his current 
address recently  from a debt agency  used  by NatWest. I accept that NatWest  has told the 
debt agencies of the ex-partners change of address. But, they cant force the debt agencies  
not to use Mr Ss address. So, I think that Mr S will have to complain to these debt agencies  
if they continue  to use his address for his ex-partner. 
Im sorry  that this isnt the outcome that Mr S wanted. I hope that I have clearly explained my 
reasons why I think that it is the right decision.  
Ref: DRN71493943my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I require National Westminster Bank Plc:
to pay £150  compensation to Mr S, and
to ensure that the address for Mr Ss ex-partner is changed to the previous address 
that they hold for her, and
to inform the debt agencies  that they use of the change of address for Mr Ss ex-
partner.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 September 2019.
