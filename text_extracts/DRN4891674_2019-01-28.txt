K821x#15complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest)  applied a default  to his 
account without  telling  him.
background
Mr A had a bank account and credit card with NatWest. When  he moved abroad for a few 
years he didnt use his accounts very much. And his credit card limit was reduced from 
£15000 to £4000 while he was away. But NatWest never told him about it. And he only found 
out when his card was declined when he was paying a bill. Hed assumed his account 
manager had been looking after things while he was abroad.
Mr A said hed let NatWest know he wasnt at his old address. But the bank only updated  his 
bank account   not his credit card. He eventually found out that a default  had been applied 
against him. But NatWest  had written to his old address. And he was embarrassed  his 
ex-wife had seen the correspondence. Mr A would like the default removing while  he pays  
off the remaining balance.
NatWest could see a direct debit had been  returned unpaid in 2014. But it couldnt  contact 
Mr A on the telephone  numbers hed provided. And the mail it had sent to Mr A had also 
been returned. When NatWest spoke to Mr A in February 2015 he told the bank  the address 
on file belonged to his ex-wife. But she passed  on any mail to him. NatWest said itd 
received a payment of £100 from Mr A but it didnt receive any further payments. And the 
bank hadnt received an updated address or been able to contact Mr A by telephone.  So his 
account was closed and defaulted.
NatWest said it spoke  to Mr A again in October  2017. And it noted his new address. But it 
didnt update its records properly. And it didnt call back Mr A as promised. So NatWest 
acknowledged hed been unaware  of what was happening. NatWest  apologised and credited  
Mr As credit  card with £50 to reduce the outstanding balance. And it informed the debt 
collection agency of Mr As contact details so he could arrange a repayment plan. The 
default would be removed once the balance had been cleared.
Mr A wasnt  satisfied with NatWests response. So he contacted our service  and our 
investigator looked into the matter. She could  see Mr As account had fallen into arrears due 
to returned direct debits  rather  than Mr A failing to make the payments himself.  And she 
could see Mr A was embarrassed the information had been sent to his ex-wife.  He shouldve  
been told by email or telephone. NatWest  had agreed it didnt update its records properly. 
But she felt the default wouldve probably  still been applied. So she couldnt  recommend it 
being removed  before the balance had been  cleared. But she did think  NatWest should pay 
Mr A £250  compensation for the trouble and upset hed suffered.
NatWest didnt agree. The default notice had to be sent by letter.  It was a statutory 
requirement. So it was sent to the only address it had on file. And itd asked Mr A for 
updated information on two occasions without response.  So its asked for an ombudsmans 
final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN48916742I can understand Mr As frustration. He had a private  banking  account and a personal  
account manager. And he doesnt think he received the proper service. NatWest failed to 
update his address when he moved overseas.  And it placed a default on his account and 
sent the correspondence to his ex-wife. So it caused  him a great deal of embarrassment.
NatWest said it tried to contact Mr A on a number of occasions without success.  And it had 
to send the notice of default by post to the address  it had on file. But Mr A had told NatWest  
in June 2014 he was working abroad. And he said it should contact  him by email or 
telephone. So I wouldve  expected his manager to send copies of any correspondence to his 
email address as well - especially as the posted copies were being  returned to the bank. 
Mr A says he told NatWest in February  2015 he would set up a PO box for correspondence.  
But theres no record of the bank updating its records.  And when he informed the bank again 
in 2017 it took a further 5 months for his address to be altered on his credit card account  
even though the bank  had already updated his savings account.
Based on what Ive seen  I think its likely Mr A did give NatWest a new address before the 
default was applied in July 2015. And its clear  NatWest made further mistakes in updating  
its records in 2017. I recognise NatWest  needed  to send a letter confirming the default.  But I 
do think Mr As manager couldve also emailed copies to Mr A. It shouldve been clear  he 
was unlikely to see the default letter if it was posted  to an address hed already said hed left. 
I realise Mr A didnt always make the agreed payments. And I cant say for certain he would 
have managed his account differently even if the correspondence had been handled better. 
NatWest has said it will remove  the default  once the balance is cleared. I think  thats 
reasonable in the circumstances. And I wont ask NatWest to remove  the default any sooner. 
But I do think the bank  couldve offered  a better  level of service.  It was sending important 
information to an address  it knew was out of date. And there  doesnt  appear to have been 
any effort to send copies  by email - which wouldve  had a better  chance  of getting to Mr A. 
NatWest has acknowledged mistakes were made in updating its records.  So I do think the 
bank should compensate Mr A for its poor service. And for the trouble and upset its caused 
him. I can see our investigator has recommended NatWest pay Mr A £250 compensation. 
And I think thats a fair and reasonable amount given everything  thats  happened.
my final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should  pay Mr A £250 compensation 
for his trouble  and upset.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 February  2019.
