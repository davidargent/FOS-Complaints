The complaint
Mrs W complains that Monzo Bank Ltd wont refund transactions she says she didnt 
authorise.
What happened
Mrs W said on 5 October 2020, she received a call from someone claiming to be from 
Monzo where she was told there was suspicious activity on her account. She said she 
looked and saw transactions involving Argos and her Lloyds account. She said the caller 
already knew her personal details and PIN, and they asked her to verify her details.
The next day, Mrs W realised several payments had debited her account and that her email 
account and her Lloyds account had been compromised.
She reported this to Monzo, who declined to refund the transactions. Thats because it 
couldnt see how the payments had been authorised by anyone other than Mrs W. 
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint, agreeing with Monzo that these payments were 
authorised. Mrs W disagreed. In summary she said:
She didnt authorise the payments, add Apple Pay to any device or share any 
personal information.
Two people were arrested in connection with the fraud, so she cant understand how 
this doesnt help her case.
Monzo ought to have intervened as the activity was highly unusual for her account.
The complaint has been passed to me to reach a final decision. For ease, Ive included a 
timeline showing the key events over the period in question. Some of the precise times 
arent know, but Ive generally reflected the order they appear on Mrs Ws statements.

What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons.
The starting position under the Payment Services Regulations 2017 (PSRs) is that 
Mrs W is liable for payments she authorised. 
The PSRs explain that authorisation depends on whether the payment transactions 
were authenticated correctly and whether she consented to them.
Its not disputed here that Mrs Ws card and security details were used to make the 
card transactions and that her banking credentials were used to make the faster 
payment. So Im satisfied the transactions were authenticated.
So Ive gone on to consider whether Mrs W gave her consent. The PSRs state how 
consent is given  it must be in the form, and in accordance with the procedure 
agreed between Mrs W and Monzo. In other words, consent happens when Mrs W 
uses the steps agreed for making a transaction. Its also possible for someone else to 
act on Mrs Ws behalf and use these agreed steps.
Its not clear that Mrs W herself used the agreed steps for all the transactions  for 
example, shes pointed out that she was at work when some of the transactions took 
place in a different location. So I have instead considered whether she did something 
that meant someone else could make payments on her behalf.
To answer this, I have noted that: 
oA device, that Mrs W used since July 2020 and was in Mrs Ws possession, 
was active on Monzos app at the time the disputed transactions were made. Indeed, it was this device that approved some of the card transactions and 
made the faster payment. It was also this device that made a withdrawal from 
Mrs Ws Savings Pot that ultimately facilitated some of the payments from the 
account. 
oSome of the payments were facilitated by incoming payments from Mrs Ws 
Lloyds account. Its not clear how someone else was able to access this 
account. 
oSome of the payments were facilitated by incoming peer to peer payments 
from individuals that Mrs W had transacted with before. 
oMrs W said that shed received a call from someone pretending to be Monzo, 
who talked her through verifying her details. But shes said that at this point, 
the payments to Argos and those involving her Lloyds account had already 
happened. So this doesnt explain how someone else was able to get the 
details needed for these transactions and the involvement of Mrs Ws device. 
oIve noted that arrests were made in connection with the faster payment to 
buy a car and Ive reviewed the police report. But this notes that the suspect 
called Mrs W in the days before and at the time of the faster payment. Mrs W 
has only told our service about one call with someone pretending to be 
Monzo on 5 October. Shes not told us about further calls or explained how 
she couldve been tricked into using her device to make payments.  
I cant say for certain what happened. But disputes like this one are only ever 
decided on the balance of probabilities. In other words, whats more likely than not to 
have happened. 
Here, given what Ive noted, I dont think these transactions couldve made without 
Mrs Ws knowledge or involvement. To summarise, thats in light of her devices 
involvement, how the payments were facilitated, the suggested calls between her 
and the accused, and that Ive not been persuaded how Mrs W couldve inadvertently 
shared her details and taken steps to make payments. 
So, even if she didnt take all the agreed steps to make the payments herself, I think 
its more likely than not that she did something that allowed these payments to be 
made and understood that payments were being made.
I recognise that Mrs W may not have benefited from what was purchased, but thats 
not a consideration in whether the payments were authorised. And for the reasons 
Ive explained, Im satisfied that Monzo acted fairly in treating them as authorised 
payments.
That means the starting position is that Mrs W is liable for the payments. I have also 
considered Monzos responsibility to protect Mrs W from financial harm  and so to 
intervene with any unusual or suspicious activity.
Here, its arguable that Monzo ought to have been concerned when a new device 
was registered to Mrs Ws account and a payment was attempted. But even if Monzo 
had intervened, Im not persuaded this wouldve stopped the payments. Thats 
because Im not persuaded the payments couldve happened without Mrs Ws 
knowledge and involvement with the payments. So had she been questioned, Im not 
convinced that it wouldve revealed that these transactions werent genuine. I recognise that Mrs W feels very strongly about this. But, having considered this 
carefully, I dont think Monzo can be held fairly asked to refund these disputed 
transactions. 
Following our involvement, Monzo made an offer to pay £75 compensation for 
closing Mrs Ws account immediately without notice. Given that Monzo were entitled 
to make that decision, and that I cant see the lack of notice had a significant impact 
on Mrs W, I consider the offer fair.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I think the offer to settle the complaint is fair. Monzo Bank Ltd 
must pay Mrs W £75. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 September 2022.
