The complaint
Mr J complained about lending made to him by NewDay Ltd. He said he already had a
considerable amount of unsecured debt when NewDay lent him this money, and he thought
this lending was irresponsible.
  
What happened
Mr J said he applied for a credit card with NewDay in 2017, around the time that he
experienced a close family bereavement. He said that he had a large amount of lending at
the time, with multiple applications for other credit, and loans with late repayments and
default notices issued. Mr J also said he was off work and had a minimum income. He didnt
think that this lending was responsible.
Mr J said he told NewDay in 2017 about his personal situation, and this wasnt taken into
account. This made his mental health much worse. Mr J said that the debt has since been
sold, and hes being harassed to pay money he cant afford.
Mr J wanted this default removed, and the debt to be written off in full, because he said he
shouldnt have been lent this money.
NewDay said that Mr J had opened his account at the end of May 2016. Hed told NewDay
he was earning £18,500 and had total unsecured debt of £22,300. NewDay said that the
information it received from Mr Js credit file at the time showed that he had no adverse data.
It didnt think it had made a mistake by lending to him.
NewDay also showed us that it had taken action when Mr J told it about his financial
difficulties, including cancelling the interest on Mr Js card.
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said that Mr J had applied
for the card earlier than he thought, in 2016 not 2017. And he had no arrears, no defaults,
and no payday loans at the time. Although the credit file data did show nine active accounts
and seven credit searches done in the past 12 months, that didnt necessarily mean Mr J
was experiencing financial difficulties.
Our investigator said that NewDays decision to lend Mr J £900 wasnt irresponsible.
Our investigator also said that NewDay had initially said there was no record that Mr J had
contacted it about his financial difficulties. But when it replied to our service, it said it had
found this record, and could show it had taken action. It received his letter in April 2017, and
placed the account on a payment arrangement from May 2017. NewDay also stopped
applying interest and charges to the account. Our investigator said hed confirmed this by
checking Mr Js statements. The account was later sold on to a third party, at the end of
August 2017.
Our investigator didnt think NewDay had done anything wrong.
Mr J said that multiple accounts with a high utilisation percentage shouldve been a red flag
to NewDay. And unsecured debt of £23,000 should also have been a red flag. So he felt that
lending him £900 was irresponsible. He said that although data showed he was managing
his account well, that wasnt the case, and he fell into financial difficulty shortly after this
lending. He thought this lending was a significant part of that.
Mr J wanted this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman, so it was passed to me for a
final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did propose to uphold 
it. This is what I said then: 
Mr Js complaint is in two parts, about the lending NewDay made to him, and how it
responded when he told it about his financial difficulties.
Id like to start by saying that Im satisfied NewDay did take steps when Mr J told it 
about his financial problems, and that those included suspending interest on the 
account. Ive checked that too.
I dont think that this part of Mr Js complaint should be upheld.
Ill now turn to the question of whether NewDay lent responsibly to Mr J.
The Financial Conduct Authority Handbook sets out what a lender must do to satisfy
themselves that someone can make the repayments that will fall due, before that 
lender enters into an agreement to lend. And its important that any assessment the 
lender does is based on sufficient information.
This part of the handbook sets out the different sources that a lender can use, to put
together its assessment. And it says that the extent of this assessment must be 
dependent upon and proportionate to a list of factors. Those factors include the 
financial position of the customer at the time of seeking the credit.
NewDay has told us that Mr J had no adverse credit data. But it also noted his low 
income, and high indebtedness.
When Mr J sought this credit, he had overall indebtedness which was 1.24 times his 
annual salary, before tax. That was all unsecured debt. The lending that NewDay 
was proposing would take that figure up to 1.29 times his annual salary.
I think, in those circumstances, it was appropriate for NewDay to seek more 
information than it has shown us. It didnt have anything to tell it about the monthly 
repayments that Mr J was making, and his expenses.
NewDay had to assess Mr Js ability to repay this lending in a sustainable manner. I 
simply dont think that NewDay had sufficient information to do that.
Because of the questions raised by the high number of other active accounts, the 
extent of Mr Js unsecured credit, and his relatively low income, I dont think it was 
sufficient in this case for NewDay to base its assessment on assumptions about Mr 
Js outgoings, or to rely on the credit reference agency report and score that it told us 
constituted the basis for the decision it made.
So I think that NewDay did make a mistake when it lent Mr J this money without 
completing additional checks.Mr J wants this default removed, and he wants the debt to be written off entirely. But I 
dont think either of those steps would be appropriate in this case. Thats because I 
cant say that this lending was definitely irresponsible, or that it was NewDays 
lending decision which has caused the later default. What Mr J has told us about the 
events that happened subsequently, make me think that this default wouldve been 
likely to occur in any event.
Nor do I think that this debt has to be written off entirely. Mr J did receive the money 
that NewDay lent him. It would be very unusual for our service to say he doesnt have 
to pay it back. But allowing a lender to profit from lending which it hasnt been clear is 
responsible lending is different. Because NewDay cant show this lending was 
responsible, I think it should pay back all the interest and fees that were added to this 
lending. It should use that money to reduce Mr Js debt in the first instance.
If NewDay isnt able to make this refund without buying back Mr Js debt from a third 
party, then it must do so.
Mr J says that he was in a cycle of debt, and this lending made it worse. Mr J has 
also told us about personal issues which happened a little after this lending was 
made. I think those personal issues have clearly also contributed to the problems Mr 
J experienced, so I dont think NewDay is solely responsible for that. I think the 
refund Ive asked NewDay to make, provides a fair and reasonable outcome to this 
complaint.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
NewDay didnt reply. Mr J simply said he accepted my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I havent changed my mind. Ill now make the award I originally proposed.
  
My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd must pay back all the interest and fees that were added 
to this lending. It should use that money to reduce Mr Js debt in the first instance.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 August 2021.
