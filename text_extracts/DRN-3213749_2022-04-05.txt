The complaint
Mr H complains that Tesco Personal Finance PLC (Tesco) defaulted his credit card.
What happened
Mr H had a Tesco credit card. In December 2019, the balance was £7,924.54 and the limit 
was £7,825. On 19 March 2020, Tesco sent Mr H a Notice of Default with the balance at 
£8,174.58. It said that arrears of £558 should be paid within 28 days.  Mr H paid in £100 on 2 
April 2020. On 15 April 2020, Tesco sent him a termination letter with the balance at  
£8,074.58. In April 2020, the default was registered. On 4 May 2020, Mr H paid in £790  
which cleared the arrears on the account.
Mr H complained. He said the default wasnt fair as he was affected by the pandemic and 
Tesco shouldve been more sympathetic in the light of that. He said he hadnt received any 
letters from Tesco, nor had they contacted him. He said he now couldnt get a mortgage as 
the default was shown on his credit records for six years.
Tesco said theyd acted fairly. Mr H hadnt made any payments to his credit card since 18 
December 2019. He hadnt paid in the amount needed under the Notice of Default dated 19 
March 2020 (£558). Following the termination letter dated 15 April 2020, no further interest 
or charges were debited to his account. The default was registered on Mr Hs credit file in 
the same month. Tesco said theyd tried to contact Mr H many times  they said theyd 
called him 84 times since 18 January 2020, and a further five letters had been sent to his 
home address since January 2020 (in addition to the Notice of Default and termination 
letter). He had also been able to see his statements online. And so  Tesco said theyd 
communicated effectively with Mr H about his situation. They offered to consider a payment 
break under the pandemic support scheme  but as Mr Hs financial difficulties predated the 
pandemic, the defaults registered in his name had to remain in place. Tesco offered to 
refund some of the money Mr H had paid in in May 2020 (£790)  and offered to consider a 
payment plan for him to pay back the money owed over a period.
Mr H brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Tesco acted fairly. The last payment 
made by Mr H was on 18 December 2019  when he paid in £354. No further payments 
were made in January 2020, February 2020, or March 2020. Mr H was then three months in 
arrears.  So, a Notice of Default was then sent to Mr H and a default registered. She said 
this was in line with guidance from the Information Commissioners Office (ICO)  which said 
that a default may be registered where an account was three months in arrears. Mr H 
couldnt be considered for assistance under the Financial Conduct Authoritys (FCA) Covid  
19 support scheme  as he was already in financial difficulty prior to the pandemic. This 
meant he didnt qualify for it.
Mr H didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H had said that he feels that Tesco werent supportive or sympathetic in taking the 
actions they did  by registering a default against him. He said this was harsh in the light of 
the effects of the pandemic. He now cant get a mortgage as the default is showing on his 
credit file for six years.
Ive looked at what happened here. Ive looked at Mr Hs statements and I can see that 
during most of 2019, he was regularly in arrears on his Tesco credit card. Between January 
2019 and October 2019, Mr H was in arrears each month; and was also over his limit of 
£7,825. On 31 October 2019 he paid in £479  but this still left the account in arrears. On 18 
December 2019, he paid in £354 and this cleared the arrears  for the first time in the year. 
And so - its fair to say that for some time before the default actions were taken by Tesco, Mr 
H had been in difficulty. And I think its reasonable for Tesco to have taken this into account 
when they took their action later, starting in March 2020.
I can also see that Tesco contacted Mr H many times during 2019. Their records show that 
Mr H was sent Notices of Default every month between February 2019 and November 2019. 
And in January 2020 and February 2020, they sent a further five letter to Mr H about the 
arrears and impending default action  so he must have been aware of his situation well 
before Tesco took further action in March 2020.
I can also see that Mr H paid in £479 and £354 in October 2019 and December 2019  and 
these payments finally cleared the outstanding arrears on his account. But equally, the credit 
of £354 paid in on 18 December 2019 was the last payment made by Mr H until £100 was 
paid in on 2 April 2020. So, by that time no payments had been made for three months.  
Tesco sent Mr H a Notice of Default on 19 March 2020  requiring payment of the arrears of 
£558 within 28 days (i.e. by 16 April 2020). The letter said that if the amount wasnt paid We 
will terminate the agreement and demand immediate repayment of the full balance on your 
card, not just the overdue payment.Your account will be reported to the credit reference 
agencies as in default and this may seriously affect your ability to gain credit in futureWe 
may pass your account to a debt collection agencyWe may sell your account to a debt 
purchaserWe may take court action to recover the balance outstanding and you may be 
liable for any court costs. So  I think Tesco were clear about what might happen if Mr H 
didnt pay the amount due.
As the amount of £558 wasnt paid, Tesco sent Mr H a termination letter and registered the 
default in April 2020. The guidance for how defaults may be applied is provided by the ICO. 
They say a default may be recorded when a customer is three months in arrears  which 
was the case here. And so  I dont think that Tesco acted unreasonably in doing so.
Mr H has said he didnt receive any of Tescos letters  but I can see they were sent to his 
address. And, given the number of them, Im not persuaded that he couldnt have received 
any of them. Ive also seen the records of Tescos calls to Mr H  and between 18 January 
2020 and 10 March 2020  they called him 84 times. So  its clear that Tesco did all they 
could to contact Mr H to try to establish a way forward with him.
Mr H had said that he believes that Tesco shouldve been more sympathetic about his 
circumstances because of the pandemic. I think he is referring here to the FCAs support 
scheme for customers who were affected. In March 2020, The Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) announced guidance to lenders in response to the effects on customers of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. All lenders, including Tesco, had to put in place payment deferrals on 
many credit agreements to help customers who were affected. Customers could ask for a 
total of two payment deferrals, each of three months  whereby payments could be 
suspended. But  the objective of the scheme was to help customers who found themselves in difficulty solely because of the pandemic. Customers who were already in arrears didnt 
qualify for it. And  because Mr H was already in arrears in March 2020  he wouldnt have 
qualified for the FCAs scheme. 
Ive then gone onto consider whether, in more general terms, we wouldve expected Tesco 
to have been more sympathetic to Mr H because of the pandemic. But  given that Mr H was 
in arrears for most of 2019, and that he made the last payment to his account on 18 
December 2019  I dont think it would be fair to expect Tesco to have taken a different 
course of action because of the later pandemic which started with the first lockdown in the 
UK announced on 23 March 2020. 
Mr H had said to us that he intends to repay the debt. But also - Tesco have said to Mr H 
that they will consider a payment plan for him to help him repay the balance he owes. Id 
encourage Mr H to speak to Tesco to see if thats something that will help him. 
But in the circumstances of Mr Hs complaint, I dont think Tesco have acted unfairly or 
unreasonably, and I wont be asking them to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 May 2022.
