K821x#15complaint
Miss C complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) was irresponsible to 
lend her money.
background
Miss C took out 12 loans  with QuickQuid between June 2015  and June 2018.  Miss C topped 
up some  of the loans.
Miss C says that was borrowing from a number of short term lenders to keep up with her 
repayments. She thinks that with better  checks, QuickQuid wouldve discovered that she 
couldnt afford to take on new debt. 
The adjudicator recommended that Miss Cs complaint  should  be upheld  in part. In 
summary, she thought  that QuickQuid should not have agreed loans five to seven and 11 
and 12.
The adjudicator asked QuickQuid to remove loans  five to seven, 11 and 12 entirely from 
Miss Cs credit file. The adjudicator also recommended  that QuickQuid  refund  the interest 
and charges that Miss C had paid on the affected loans.
QuickQuid disagreed with the adjudicators view. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss C 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that 
QuickQuid should  fairly  and reasonably  have  done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN56448532There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Cs complaint.
As the adjudicator explained,  there are two separate periods of lending. This is because  
there were breaks in lending between loan seven  and eight such  that Ive looked at the two 
periods of lending separately;  loans  one to seven and loans eight and 12.
At the beginning  of each period of lending, there wasnt anything  in the information that   
Miss C gave or the information that QuickQuid shouldve been aware of which meant that it 
was unreasonable of QuickQuid to agree to lend. 
Having looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history with Miss C; I think  
QuickQuid should  reasonably have  seen Miss C was unlikely to have been able to make  her 
loan repayments  in a sustainable  manner by the time it provided loan five and then loan 11. I 
say this because:
by the time that Miss C borrowed loan five and then borrowed loan 11 she had been 
borrowing money over an extended  period of time  nine months for loan five and 
about seven months at the point of taking out loan 11.
Although the amounts that Miss C was borrowing  fluctuated, loan five was double the 
amount of loan four. And there  had only been breaks of a few days or couple  of 
weeks between taking  some  of the earlier  loans.
QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more likely than not Miss C was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole the repayment  of her previous loans left in her 
finances and that Miss Cs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
during each chain of lending Miss C wasnt making any real inroads into what  she 
owed QuickQuid and her indebtedness  was being prolonged. This meant that Miss C 
had been paying  large amounts of interest  to, in effect; service a debt to QuickQuid 
over a long period.
QuickQuid said that Miss C had a stellar repayment history with breaks  in lending and that 
there was nothing to indicate that she was experiencing financial difficulties. But I think  that 
QuickQuid will know (or should know) from previous decisions that this service considers 
there will be times when the pattern of lending alone is enough to indicate that its likely the 
customer is experiencing financial difficulties or would  otherwise be harmed by further 
lending. So it follows that a good repayment history doesnt automatically mean that Miss C 
could afford  to repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
Ive taken account of the substantial break in lending between loans seven and eight  in my 
decision. But I dont  consider some  of the shorter breaks that QuickQuid points to should  
necessarily be taken  as an indication that Miss C had moved on from whatever situation  had 
required her previous loans. 
I think that Miss C lost out because QuickQuid provided loans five to seven, 11 and 12 
because:
Ref: DRN56448533these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Cs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the extended period of time she owed QuickQuid money was likely to have had 
negative implications on Miss Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her 
in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Miss Cs complaint about  loans five to seven, 11 and 12.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges that Miss C paid on loans five to seven, 11 and 12;
 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;  and
the number  of loans taken by the time of loan five and then loan 11 means that any 
information about five to seven, 11 and 12 is negative. So all entries about loans five to 
seven, 11 and 12 should be removed from Miss Cs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss C a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Cs complaint in part and direct  CashEuroNet UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 August 2019.
