The complaint
Mr S complains about the amount that hes been charged by Mercedes-Benz Financial 
Services UK Limited, trading as Mercedes-Benz Finance, for two tyres on a car that he 
returned at the end of his hire agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr S signed a hire agreement with Mercedes-Benz Finance in March 2017 for a new 
car to be supplied to him;
the hire agreement said: When it is time to return your vehicle  you must return the 
vehicle in line with the Vehicle Returns Standards and those standards were set out 
in the agreement;
Mr S returned the car when the agreement ended and it was inspected in March 
2019 when its mileage was recorded as 21,428;
the inspection identified that the treads on the front tyres were illegal because they 
had depths of less than 1.6mm so Mercedes-Benz Finance charged Mr S £631.36  
he complained about the charge and it offered to reduce the amount of the invoice by 
25% as a gesture of goodwill to £473.52;
Mr S didnt accept that offer and says that the tyres shouldnt need to be changed 
given the cars mileage and theyre worn because of a fault with the cars tracking;
the car had a visual health check in February 2019 before it was returned by Mr S - a 
red warning was given for the two front tyres and it was noted that one was illegal 
and the other was in a poor condition  so Mr S was aware that there were issues 
with those tyres;
Mr S accepts that he didnt tell the garage that he was concerned about the cars 
tracking and Ive not seen enough evidence to support his claim that theres a fault 
with the cars tracking that has caused the wear on the tyres;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the tyres werent acceptable in accordance 
with the vehicle return standards when the car was returned by Mr S and I dont 
consider that it was reasonable for the car to be returned with tyres that had tread 
depth that was below the legal minimum;
I consider that its fair and reasonable for Mercedes-Benz Finance to charge Mr S for 
the cost of two replacement tyres and I consider that its response to his complaint 
was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Mercedes-Benz Finance to reduce (or waive) the amount that its charged Mr S for 
the two tyres or to take any other action in response to his complaint  if he now 
wants to accept its offer to pay £473.52 I suggest that he contacts it to see if the offer 
remains available.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 August 2020.
