The complaint
Mr T complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk 
acted irresponsibly when lending to him. 
What happened
MoneyBoat provided Mr T with loans as follows:
Loan Date taken Date paid Monthly 
Instalments Loan

repayment 
1 21/05/2021 26/05/2021 3 £500.00 £209.74

3 26/06/2021 outstanding 4 £1,300.00 £520.06
When Mr T first complained to MoneyBoat, it didnt uphold his complaint, so he brought his 
complaint to us and one of our adjudicators investigated. 
Mr T mainly said that MoneyBoat loaned to him despite the fact hed been unable to obtain 
credit for a long time due to adverse information shown on his credit file  and he felt it was 
particularly irresponsible when MoneyBoat kept lending to him.  
Our adjudicator thought that, at the point of loan 3, proportionate checks would most likely 
have shown that Mr T was having problems managing his money. Our adjudicator thought 
that MoneyBoat should've become aware of the extent of Mr Ts spending on gambling and 
that MoneyBoat ought to have realised it was unlikely Mr T would be able to sustainably 
repay this loan. So our adjudicator upheld Mr Ts complaint about loan 3 and set out the 
steps she said MoneyBoat should take to put things right.
Mr T accepted our adjudicators view. MoneyBoat disagreed with our adjudicators view. In 
summary, MoneyBoat said it believed that the checks it did were proportionate and Mr T had 
adequate disposable income to pay for all these loans. So MoneyBoat felt that the lending it 
provided was affordable for him. 
As the complaint hasnt been resolved, it comes to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice, this means that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr T 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income) 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
MoneyBoat was required to establish whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties. And in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments - as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Taking all this into account, Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and 
information provided and thought about what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
Looking at the first two loans, I agree with the adjudicator that it wasnt wrong for MoneyBoat 
to give Mr T these loans. And as Mr T seems happy to accept what our adjudicator said 
about these loans, I dont think that I need to say more about them.
MoneyBoat told us about the checks it did before lending loan 3 to Mr T. It asked him to 
provide details of his income and to tell MoneyBoat what he normally spent each month. And 
MoneyBoat also carried out checks on Mr Ts credit file. 
Like our adjudicator, I dont agree that MoneyBoat made a fair lending decision when it 
provided loan 3 to Mr T. Heres why I say this.Based on what Mr T had told MoneyBoat about his financial situation, MoneyBoat 
understood that he had ample disposable income each month. The amount Mr T was now 
applying to borrow was as much as the combined amount of the two loans that he had 
previously taken out and quickly repaid over the course of the last month or so. Given Mr Ts 
apparent rapidly increasing need for expensive credit, I think MoneyBoat should have 
realised that Mr Ts borrowing seemed to be at odds with what Mr T had told MoneyBoat 
about his circumstances. 
I think his pattern of lending and early repayment also suggested that potentially his finances 
were unstable and Mr T was having difficulty planning and managing his money in a 
structured way. It was apparent from MoneyBoats credit checks that there was some history 
of money problems and by the time he applied for loan 3, it looked very much as if Mr T 
might be running into more financial difficulty  a recently delinquent account was now 
entering its third month as payments hadnt been brought up to date and his balance to limit 
ratio for revolving credit/budget was 109% - in other words, he had exceeded his available 
credit limit.    
I think all this information shouldve prompted MoneyBoat to carry out more thorough checks 
into Mr Ts financial situation before agreeing to lend. I think MoneyBoat should have taken 
steps to verify what Mr T was saying about his financial circumstances as it was evident that 
it had contradictory information in front of it and what Mr T had declared wasnt reflected in 
other information MoneyBoat had gathered. MoneyBoat hasnt shown me it did this. So 
I cant fairly say that it carried out a proportionate check before agreeing to lend to Mr T. 
This means I need to think about what its likely MoneyBoat would have found out had it 
done what I consider wouldve been proportionate checking when Mr T applied for loan 3. 
Mr T has provided his bank statements so Ive looked through these to see what MoneyBoat 
was likely to have found out. 
In the absence of other evidence, I think these give a useful insight into Mr Ts finances at 
the time and had MoneyBoat looked in more depth at Mr Ts finances it would likely have 
seen that he was facing serious problems managing his money. I think it would have learnt 
that Mr T was regularly spending significant amounts on gambling transactions. I think, had it 
seen those transactions, that MoneyBoat should have concluded it was unlikely that Mr T 
would be able to repay this loan in a sustainable manner. 
This means I cant fairly say it was reasonable for MoneyBoat to think that it was likely Mr T 
would be able sustainably to repay his borrowing. So this leads me to conclude that it 
shouldnt have provided this loan.
In coming to my decision, I've taken into account that Mr T repaid some loans early  but this 
doesnt necessarily mean that he was able to do so in a way that was sustainable for him. 
Im also aware that MoneyBoat declined a later loan application  but this doesnt mean that 
loan 3 was sustainably affordable for Mr T. 
For the reasons I've explained more fully above, Im upholding the complaint about loan 3 
and MoneyBoat should put things right.
Putting things right
I think it is fair and reasonable for Mr T to repay the principal amount that he borrowed, 
because he had the benefit of that lending. 
But he has been charged extra for a loan that should not have been provided to him. In line with this Services approach, Mr T shouldnt repay more than the principal amount he 
borrowed. 
If MoneyBoat has sold any outstanding debt it should buy it back before doing what I have 
outlined below. 
If MoneyBoat isnt able to buy the debt back then it should liaise with the new debt owner to 
achieve the following:
A) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on loan 3, and treat any 
repayments made by Mr T as though they had been repayments of the principal on all 
outstanding loans. If this results in Mr T having made overpayments then MoneyBoat should 
refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from 
the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 
B) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A should be used 
to repay any balance remaining. If this results in a surplus then this should be paid to Mr T. 
However if there is still an outstanding balance then MoneyBoat should try to agree an 
affordable repayment plan with Mr T. MoneyBoat shouldnt pursue outstanding balances 
made up of principal already written-off.
C) Whilst its fair that Mr Ts credit file is an accurate reflection of his financial history, its 
unfair that he should be disadvantaged by any adverse information recorded about a loan 
that was unfairly provided. So MoneyBoat should remove any adverse information it has 
recorded on Mr Ts credit file for loan 3. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Mr T a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ts complaint about loan 3 and direct Evergreen Finance London Limited 
trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk to take the steps I've set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 May 2022.
