The complaint
Mr W complains that he has paid off all the loans approved for him by Morses Club PLC and 
he does not owe it the £93 Morses says he owes.
What happened
Using information from Morses here is a brief table of the loans approved for Mr W. 
Loan Approved Amount Term

weeksRepaid 
1 10 January 2019 £400 33 27 June 2019 (loan 3 likely used 
to repay loan 1)
2 9 May 2019 £200 33 6 November 2019 (loan 5 likely 
used to repay loan 2)
3 27 June 2019 £600 52 21 September 2020
4 29 August 2019 £180 33 8 June 2020
5 6 November 2019 £200 34 14 September 2020
6 19 February 2020 £200 24 outstanding
Mr W maintains that his last loan was 6 November 2019. He has asked Morses to 
investigate whether loan 6 was properly approved as he did not think he had a loan 6 at all. 
Morses did look into it and its final response letter (FRL) dated 21 February 2021 explained 
that it had looked into this and Morses was able to show that Mr W did take loan 6.
On 21 September 2020 Mr W gave his Morses agent what he thought was the final £50 
payment. He was informed that he still had more to pay which had worked out to be £93. 
Mr W disagreed and although he sent two cheques to clear that balance he then changed 
his mind and arranged for the bank to cancel the cheques. Morses says in its FRL that he 
owes it £93 and Mr W says he does not. 
Our adjudicator looked at the complaint and spoke to Mr W on two occasions. He gave his 
view which was as follows:  
- after careful consideration of all the account statements for the loans he thought that 
the outstanding balance did relate to loan 6 and not loan 1; and 
- our adjudicator did identify that on 16 July 2020 the balance still to pay across all 
loans was £388 and he copied to Mr W this table (adapted by me) to show the three 
outstanding balances on loans 3, 5 and 6 (loan 4 had been repaid in June 2020):
Date of payments Loan ref Payment method Payment 
madeBalance still to 
pay
13/07/2020 5 Card (PDA) £9.76 £53.84
13/07/2020 6 Card (PDA) 9.75 186.88
13/07/2020 3 Card (PDA) 20.49 147.28
Total still to pay £388
- and our adjudicator worked out that after making a number of payments from 20 July 
to 21 September 2020 Mr W had repaid £295 which did leave a balance to pay. 
Mr W had destroyed all his payment books and so our adjudicator said that without anything 
from him, there was nothing to be able to re-check the payments that Morses Club show, but 
from what he did have it seems that the payments made were insufficient. 
Because of the explanations Mr W had given to our adjudicator, he had asked Morses for a 
recording of a call between Mr W and a lady from Morses who said that Mr W did not owe 
Morses anything. Mr W did not have a date for that call. Morses has told us that it could not 
be traced. 
In the circumstances, our adjudicator did not think that the complaint should be upheld. 
Mr W disagreed and the complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Since the complaint was passed to me I have listened to the recorded calls we have 
between Mr W and our adjudicator to fully understand Mr Ws concerns. I have reviewed all 
the documents we have, including Mr Ws letters to us and the documents Morses has sent 
to us. And I asked for additional material, including all of Mr Ws letters written to Morses, 
details of his earlier complaints and any recorded calls it may have had with Mr W. 
Morses was able to send me more details and one recorded call from 2 July 2021 which did 
not really take the matter much further as the part during which Mr W spoke to the 
complaints department has not been recorded and I have not heard it. Morses has re-checked the figures and has said: 
I can confirm that the total amount borrowed including capital and interest was 
£3,059, the total repayments total £2,942.85 and the ESR total £23.15. This leaves a 
balance of £93 remaining to be paid.
An ESR is an early settlement rebate which I can see Mr W received when he repaid loan 1 
(on the same day he was approved for loan 3) and when Mr W repaid loan 2 (on the same 
day that loan 5 was approved).
Having looked at everything carefully I must agree with the adjudicator that although Mr W is 
adamant he has repaid all his loans, I have decided that the records show there remains a 
£93 balance to pay. And without Mr Ws own payment books then I have nothing to cross-
reference his records with those from Morses. 
Answering some of Mr Ws points
Mr W has said that its a well known fact that you cant have more than one loan running at 
the same time. My experience of Morses and other home-credit (doorstep) loan companies 
is that you can, and often the companies do approve customers for more than one loan at 
the same time. 
Mr W had three loans running over a long period of time and it looks as thought the 
payments he was making were allocated to each loan to gradually pay them down. There 
was a period during February 2020 to June 2020 when Mr W had four loans running at the 
same time  loans 3, 4, 5 and 6. 
I do find this surprising considering Mr W was receiving a pension only, but Mr W has not 
asked me to look into this, so I say no more about it.
I understand that Mr W has felt frustrated about this whole episode surrounding the balances 
and him still owing Morses some money. But on the information we have I can come to no 
other conclusion  that the loans were approved for him and that he signed for them and that 
he has not quite paid them all off. 
I realise that Mr W will be disappointed.
Other observations 
During my review of this complaint I have noticed a few details which may help Mr W to 
know about, as they may assist him in understanding what may have happened. 
Loans being refinanced into another is not uncommon. And the records for Mr Ws account 
shows that Loan 1 appears to have been refinanced into loan 3 and loan 2 into loan 5. 
An alert was placed on Mr Ws account around 20 June 2020 which was to indicate that 
Mr W may need some additional assistance and I asked Morses about that. It sent to me 
some notes added to Mr Ws account:  
customer has got himself into a bit of a mess financially and a few health issues - 
fully understood conversation.
And it may be that this was the time that Mr W may have misunderstood the balances of the 
accounts and had lost track as to which loan was being repaid with which amounts.  I mention it in case this may be one explanation. And as Ive said earlier, Mr W has not kept 
his payment books and so I can only proceed with Morses records. 
I have seen from the Morses account notes I have been sent that after Mr W had raised his 
dissatisfaction, on 17 July 2020 Morses had sent to him copies of the statements of account 
for loans 3, 5 and 6. The notes say that these were sent to hm so that he could check 
payments against his payment book. At that stage I understand from Mr Ws explanations to 
us that he would have had, still, his payment books. And so, in July 2020 Mr W did have the 
details needed to cross-refer his records with Morses records. So, Mr W did have the 
opportunity for these statements of account and his payment books to be double-checked. 
But I do not have those details now as Mr W has not been able to send us his payment 
books. 
I have seen a copy of a letter Mr W wrote to Morses soon after he must have received those 
statements of account and it is dated 22 July 2020. In it he says that he had decided he was 
going to pay to Morses £300 and no more because he was so annoyed. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ws complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 February 2022.
