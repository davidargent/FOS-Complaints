K821x#15complaint
Mr K has complained about fees and charges added to his mortgage account  by 
The Co-operative Bank Plc (Co-op). Mr K considers the charges  have  been  applied unfairly 
and he would like Co-op to refund them.
background
Mr K has a mortgage account with Co-op.  Over the years  the account  has been in arrears, 
as a result  of which Co-op applied fees and charges.
On 18 February 2019 another  ombudsman  decided that we could only consider fees and 
charges applied within six years of Mr K submitting his complaint. That was on 18 January 
2018. The ombudsman  decided that we could only consider fees and charges applied after 
18 January 2012.
An investigator looked at the complaint. She noted that no charges  had been  applied after 
January 2014.  With regard to fees applied between 18 January 2012 and 31 December 
2013, the investigator recommended that Co-op should refund the following fees and 
charges:
28 June 2012 Litigation fee £372.20
1 August 2012 Monthly  arrears fee £  25.00
1 October 2012 Monthly  arrears fee £  25.00
1 December 2012 Monthly  arrears fee £  25.00
30 January 2013 Litigation fee £115.00
3 April 2013 Referral to collections fee £  55.00
1 July 2013 Monthly  arrears fee £  25.00
1 August 2013 Monthly  arrears fee £  25.00
2 September 2013 Monthly  arrears fee £  25.00
1 October 2013 Monthly  arrears fee £  25.00
1 November 2013 Monthly  arrears fee £  25.00
Co-op agreed to this, and also offered to refund a litigation fee of £670.77 applied on 7 May 
2013. In total,  the refund  Co-op agreed to make was £1,412.97. 
The investigator thought this was fair. She initially thought Co-op should pay interest  at 8% 
on the refunded  fees. But after clarifying  that Mr K hadnt redeemed  his mortgage, she 
explained to both Mr K and Co-op that this wasnt appropriate.
Mr K didnt accept Co-ops  offer to refund  fees or the investigators recommendation. He said 
that he would be willing to accept, in full and final settlement, the refund of charges of 
£1,412.97, plus interest  at 8% p.a. simple  on those charges.
Because the matter couldnt be resolved, it now falls to me to make  a decision on the 
complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  After reviewing the file, the only issue  I 
need to decide is the redress which should be awarded.
Ref: DRN49822042Ive reviewed the decision made by my previous ombudsman colleague, and I agree that we 
cant consider any fees and charges  applied  before18 January 2012. Ive also reviewed the 
fees and charges applied  to the account  since then.
I see that Co-op has agreed  to refund charges of £1,412.97 and Ive noted the breakdown of 
those charges. Im satisfied that this is a fair offer of redress.
Mr K has agreed that he will be willing to accept this refund, if he is paid interest  on the fees 
at 8% p.a. simple. But because his mortgage  account is still open, rather than paying  Mr K 
interest, instead Co-op will need  to re-work the account to remove  any interest applied  to the 
fees and charges. The effect of this is that the account balance  will reduce by both the 
removal of the fees and charges and the removal of the compound  interest on those fees 
and charges.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement I direct The 
Co-Operative Bank Plc to refund fees and charges  totalling £1,412.97 as set out above back 
to the mortgage  account and to remove any interest  applied on those  fees and charges. I 
make no other order or award.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 December  2019.
