Mr C complains that his loans with CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, were  lent 
irresponsibly. 
Mr C is represented by a third party.

8.c 29/11/2016 additional £100 £873 3 £612 19/12/2016
Loan 8 was repaid early on 19 December 2016  and so the final sum paid was just under 
£589 being £500 principal  sum and just under £89 interest. 
Mr C says that he was taking out pay day loans  to pay off other payday loans. 
QuickQuid said that it did not think it had done anything wrong. 
One of our adjudicators considered the complaint and decided  that QuickQuid ought  to put 
things right for Mr C in relation to the additional  lending for Loans 8 meaning 8a, 8b and 8c. 
QuickQuid responded  immediately  and did not agree. It said that as the lending  was after 
1 March 2015 then it would have  complied with its updated affordability review and so it 
repeated that it did not think it had done anything wrong. 
Ref: DRN89794792Neither Mr C nor his representative has responded to our adjudicators opinion which was 
sent to them  in June 2018. No copy bank statements have been received from Mr C. His 
personal credit file has been  provided.
In view of Mr Cs non-response  then I take that to mean that he does not take issue with our 
adjudicators opinion. So I plan to consider the disputed loan approvals which are the 
additional sums approved following Loan 8.
 
The complaint in relation to the Loan  8 additional  borrowing remains unresolved and so it 
has been passed to me for a decision.  
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner 
without it adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. The 
key element was that any checks needed  to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different  things,  including how much was being lent and when  the sum being  
borrowed was due to be repaid. 
The argument by QuickQuid in relation to its affordability review procedures  for loans 
approved after 1 March 2015 has been presented to this service  before on other cases and it 
has received this services responses  in earlier decision of which  QuickQuid is aware. In the 
circumstances I do not propose to rehearse them here. 
I have considered the points in its email relating to its calculations  of Mr Cs EDI  
QuickQuids terminology for estimated disposable income. 
QuickQuid has not provided us with copies of any credit searches it carried  out nor the exact  
figures and method for calculation  what it says was Mr Cs EDI for Loan  8. So I cannot say 
much more about that.
Mr C has not provided bank statements but we do have  his declared income and 
expenditure as provided to QuickQuid for Loan  8 and the additional borrowing. And so I have 
used that information plus Mr Cs personal  credit  file to gain some  idea of his financial 
circumstances at the time. 
Loan 8 was applied for on 25 November 2016 and I would  have  expected that the checks 
carried out at that stage  in the lending relationship would have been for QuickQuid to know  
Mr Cs income  and expenditure. Mr C told QuickQuid his monthly  income was £1,600 and 
his monthly expenditure was £510  which included rent, utility  expenses,  transport, food and 
credit commitments  plus a sum for other expenses. So it would  have appeared to 
QuickQuid that the disposable income he had was about £1,090.
Ref: DRN89794793QuickQuid explains that in fact this is what it did (ONS being a reference  to the Office for 
National Statistics which  provides statistical data):  
We also validated his reported expenses against credit  report  data and ONS estimates, 
which resulted in an EDI of £372.99. Consequently, the total cost of this loan (£372.80)  was 
only 32% of the EDI during this period of 91 days.
When assessing Mr Cs application the full term of the loan and the agreed interest would 
have been part of the assessment. So on 25 November 2016  the term was due to be for 95 
days and the total due was going  to have  been £352 due to be repaid on 28 February 2017. 
Each top-up request  did not change the due date  28 February 2017. And the sums applied  
for were approved and led to the first two instalment figures and the final repayment figure 
increasing. So for top-up one it was going  to be around £82, £77 and £367.  For top-up two it 
was going to have been £108, £102  and £490. For the third top-up the repayments were 
going to have been £132, £128  and £612.  
So it is not entirely clear  as to which date QuickQuid has calculated that the EDI for Mr C 
was just under £373. And I understand  that where the loan is structured as a three stage 
repayment loan,  QuickQuid usually considers that Mr C ought  to have been able to save  
money in the earlier repayment months  in order to repay the larger deferred third payment.
In view of the narrow  margins  between QuickQuids EDI figure and the top-up  Loans 8a, 8b 
and 8c then I think  that the element of saving was not likely. And I take into account the fact 
that Mr C was asking  for three top-ups within four days of the original loan approval and 
before the first instalment  on any part of the loan was due. This does indicate that Mr C was 
in need of cash and quickly and so that alone ought  to have alerted QuickQuid to additional 
enquiries being needed. 
And for our purposes I think that QuickQuid ought to have taken into account  Mr Cs short 
term loans with other lenders at the stage of the lending  relationship  when Mr C started  to 
ask for top-ups. 
So I have  used Mr Cs declared income (which  QuickQuid is content with as it says it 
validated that income  at the time using credit reports) and deducted  his declared expenditure 
and the STL commitments  Mr C had outstanding for each of these top-up approvals.  And it 
is clear that Mr C was not able to afford  these additional funds advanced in the days  after 
the initial approval of Loan 8. 
I uphold Mr Cs complaint  for the top-up loans being  Loans 8a, 8b and 8c. 
how to put things right
QuickQuid should  put things right for Mr C by doing  as follows: 
- refund all interest and charges paid on the first, second, and third amount of additional  
borrowing on loan eight;
- pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment  to the date of 
settlement*;
- remove  any negative  information about loan eight from Mr Cs credit  file.
Ref: DRN89794794*HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick  Quid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Cs complaint in part and direct that CashEuroNet UK 
LLC do as I have set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 June  2019.
