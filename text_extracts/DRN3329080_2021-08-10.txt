K820x#14complaint
Miss H complains that BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited (BMWFS) has unfairly  
charged her various sums after she took the decision to voluntary terminate her hire 
purchase agreement  and that she should be refunded a number  of monthly  payments  she 
made.
background
In 2016, Miss H acquired a used car using a hire purchase agreement from BMWFS. 
The total repayable under the agreement was £28,887.52. Miss H was required to make 44 
monthly payments  of £425.68 and there was a final optional payment of £10,157.60  if she 
wished to buy the car at the end of the agreement.
The agreement set out that Miss H had the right to terminate the agreement at any time 
before the final payment was due. In doing  so, BMWFS would be entitled to the return of the 
car and at least half of the total repayable under the agreement. The agreement set out this 
was £14,443.76.
In September  2018 Miss Hs car was subject to a recall for a fix to the heater blower. 
However, due to an absence of spare  parts, the required fix to Miss Hs car was still 
outstanding come April 2019.
At the end of April 2019, and with no fix having  been undertaken on her car, Miss H says she 
felt she had no choice  but to voluntary terminate  the agreement and return  the car. This she 
did, sending the necessary paperwork  to BMWFS  on 26 April 2019. In doing so she agreed 
that:
the agreement  would  be irreversibly terminated
the vehicle  would  be inspected in accordance with the British Vehicle Rental & 
Leasing Association  (BVRLA) fair wear and tear standards
she might be charged for items which fall outside of these standards
she would receive an invoice for any excess  mileage  covered
The car was collected and inspected  on 2 May 2019 the same day Miss H says she first 
complained to BMWFS.  
After Miss H handed the car back,  BMWFS charged  her the following:
£1,247.68 termination  payment
£853.26 excess mileage
£415.00 damage charges
£10.89 interest
£2,526.83 gross sum
(£425.68) adjustment representing one months contractual payment
£2,101.15 net sum
Ref: DRN33290802Miss H says given that she felt she had no choice but to voluntary terminate her agreement 
BMWFS should write  off the £2,101.15  it says she owes  and refund her the monthly  
payments she made whilst the car was subject to a recall notice, this being £3,405.44 
(£425.68 x 8 for the period September 2018  to April 2019 inclusive).
Miss Hs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded  that it 
shouldnt be upheld. In summary he said:
It was Miss Hs decision to voluntary terminate the agreement. And although  he understood 
why she might have felt the car was unsafe to drive,  there was simply insufficient evidence 
to support her view in this respect. So, it was entirely fair and reasonable for BMWFS to try 
and seek repayment  of the sums that it did from Miss H and to refuse to not refund the 
monthly payments  made by Miss H for the period September 2018 to April 2019 inclusive 
totalling £3,405.44.
Specifically, he said he was satisfied that BMWFS had calculated  the excess mileage charge 
of £853.26 correctly in line with the terms of the hire purchase agreement  and the Consumer 
Credit Act 1974 and it was entitled  to seek recovery of this sum from Miss H.
And that BMWFS was entitled  to charge £415  for damages because these damages were  
outside what the BVRLA view as being fair wear and tear. And charging for the same was 
provided for in the agreement.
Miss H disagreed, but the investigator wasnt persuaded to change his mind. Therefore, the 
complaint has been passed to me for review  and decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First, I would like to point out Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my 
comments on what I think is relevant. If I dont comment  on any specific point, its not 
because Ive failed  to take it on board and think  about it but because I dont think I need to 
comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right outcome. 
Secondly, I would add that where  the information  Ive got is incomplete, unclear or 
contradictory, as some  of its here, Ive to base my decision  on the balance of probabilities.
Miss H says she felt she had no choice but to voluntary terminate the agreement (and return  
the car) in April/May 2020 because by this time the issue subject to BMWs  recall  notice  of 
September 2019 still hadnt been  fixed. And she says because she felt she had no choice 
but to voluntary terminate the agreement  its unfair  that BMWFS  should  hold her liable for 
the charges it has and for it to hold onto the payments she made towards  her agreement 
between September  2018  and April 2019.
However, I dont agree  Miss H had no choice but to voluntary terminate her agreement. I 
accept that Miss Hs car was subject to a recall by BMW in September  2018. But if the car 
was unsafe to drive, I would have expected to see some documentary evidence  of this 
such as a letter from BMW advising her that the car was unsafe and that it shouldnt be 
driven.
Ref: DRN33290803Furthermore, although Miss H says the car was unsafe to drive, or at least she felt it was, 
Ive seen insufficient evidence to suggest  that whist  the car was subject to the recall, but not 
fixed, that Miss H stopped using it, or reduced the journeys she made  to say just essential  
ones.
I say this because  when the car was first supplied in August 2016 it had travelled 14,868 
miles. When it had its MOT test in May 2018,  it had travelled 50,301 miles, equating to 
approximately 1,650 miles a month since August  2016.
Now when the car was collected and inspected in May 2019,  it had travelled 67,936  miles,  
equating to approximately 1,600 miles a month  since May 2018, very little difference  to the 
miles travelled each month between August 2016  and May 2018.
So, taking everything  into account, Im not persuaded that the reason Miss H has given for 
voluntary terminating  her agreement is, in itself, enough for me to say BMWFS  had no right 
to seek payment of the sums that it did and that it should refund the payments made by 
Miss H between September  2018 and April 2019. However, I would add that one such 
payment has been refunded, albeit by way of a reduction against the sum BMWFS was 
originally going  to seek recovery of from Miss H, rather than by way of a payment to her.
Notwithstanding what I say above,  Ive also considered whether there are any other reasons 
that might  have prevented BMWFS from seeking  the sums from Miss H that it did.
termination payment  £1,247.68
Im satisfied this has been calculated correctly  as outlined below:
(£28,887.52) amount repayable (everything else being  equal) under  the agreement
£13,196.08 31 monthly payments made of £425.68 October 2016 to April 2019 inclusive
(£15,691.44) outstanding balance
£14,443.76 voluntary termination amount  (50% x £27,887.52)
£1,247.68 termination  payment
Im also satisfied that this sum was payable under the terms of the agreement  and the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974.
excess mileage £853.26
Im satisfied this has been calculated correctly  as outlined below:
53,068 miles travelled during the period  of hire (67,936  14,868)
41,250 contracted miles for period  of hire (1,250 a month  for 33 months)
11,818 excess miles travelled for period  of hire
£853.26 11,818 miles @ 7.22 pence a mile
Im also satisfied, for the reasons given by the investigator and which I dont repeat here,  
that the agreement is neither unclear nor misleading  concerning  the charges for excess  
mileage and Miss H is liable to pay it.
Ref: DRN33290804damage charges  £415.00
Under the terms of the agreement, Miss H is liable for certain other  charges.  This includes 
charges for scratches and dents  to the paintwork and scratches  to the alloy wheels deemed 
outside fair wear  and tear.
In summary  Miss H was charged the following:
left hand front alloy wheel  scratches  exceeding  100mm £51
right hand front alloy wheel  scratches  exceeding 100mm £51
right hand rear alloy wheel  scratches  exceeding 100mm £51
left hand front door  dented with paint damage £114
right hand front door -scratch greater than 25mm through  topcoat £106
rear bumper  scratch greater than 25mm through topcoat £42
So, in this instance, Ive to decide  if the damage  relating to the two doors, the rear bumper 
and three  of the alloy wheels, is outside  fair wear and tear. In deciding this Ive taken into 
account (amongst  other  things) industry  good  practice including  BVRLA  guidelines. 
BMWFS has provided its inspection  report which shows  damage  to three alloy wheels. 
Having reviewed the photographs of the damage, Im satisfied it looks  like wear and tear. Im 
also satisfied that it looks to be beyond the fair wear  and tear as set out in the BVRLA 
guidelines. 
The BVRLA guidelines state that scuffs up to 50mm on the total circumference of the wheel 
rim and on alloy wheels are acceptable.  
Now having looked  at the photographs provided  by BMWFS,  Im satisfied that in respect of 
all three alloy wheels  there are scuffs  exceeding  50mm of the total circumference of each. 
And because of this, I find that BMWFS has acted entirely reasonably  in charging Miss H 
£153.
BMWFS has provided its inspection  report which shows  damage  to two doors and the rear 
bumper. Having reviewed  the photographs  of the damage, Im satisfied it looks like wear and 
tear. Im also satisfied  that it looks to be beyond fair wear and tear as set out in the BVRLA 
guidelines. 
The BVRLA guidelines state that surface scratches of 25mm  or less where the primer or 
bare metal is not showing are acceptable, provided they can be polished out. And that dents 
of 15mm or less in diameter are acceptable,  providedthe  paint surface  is not broken.
Now having looked  at the photographs provided  by BMWFS,  Im satisfied that the left had 
front door has a dent with broken paint, and the right hand  front door and the rear bumper 
both have scratches exceeding  25mm.  And because  of this, I find that BMWFS  has acted 
entirely reasonably  in charging Miss H £262. 
Ref: DRN33290805interest £10.89
Im satisfied this has been calculated correctly  and the agreement  allows  for such  a sum to 
be charged. 
I also think its worth pointing  out that despite  me being satisfied that BMWFS  has the right 
to charge interest on any outstanding sums due and owing to it (for the whole time the same 
remains outstanding  and due to it) it hasnt charged  Miss H interest  after 20 June 2019.
Now I appreciate Miss H will be disappointed, but in summary  Im satisfied that BMWFS has 
done nothing wrong in charging her the sum of £2,526.83 (later reduced to £2,101.15). 
However, I would  add that BMWFS  has confirmed  to our service that its offer of £100  
made under over of its final response letter  dated 20 August 2019  is still available  for 
acceptance if Miss H would, on reflection, like to contact it and accept it. But of course, this 
is a decision for Miss H.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 September 2021.
