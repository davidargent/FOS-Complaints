The complaint
Mrs S complains that a car that was supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement with 
Black Horse Limited was mis-sold to her because it doesnt have real leather seats.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mrs S under a hire purchase agreement with Black Horse  
that was dated in March 2017;
the car was about three and a half years old, had been driven for 60,857 miles and 
had a price of £11,696.39;
Mrs S repaid the credit in February 2018 but later, when one of the seats was torn, 
she became aware that the seats werent covered in real leather so she complained 
to the dealer and Black Horse in May 2019  and she then complained to this 
service;
our investigator said that he hadnt seen any evidence to confirm that the dealer 
advised Mrs S that it was real leather and the car that was supplied to her had 
leather (but not real leather) seats  and he said that hed seen no evidence to 
show that the price she paid for the car was based on real leather seats;
Mrs S has responded in detail to our investigators recommendations and has 
explained why leather seats were important to her  she says, in summary that the 
car was advertised as having leather seats, the dealer assured her that the seats 
were leather, the cost of replacing the seats with leather seats is £1,084.80 and she 
thinks that Black Horse should contribute to that cost;
I have carefully reviewed Mrs Ss comments in response to the investigators 
recommendations  theres no dispute that the seats in the car that was supplied to 
her arent leather but neither Mrs S nor Black Horse has been able to provide a copy 
of the advert for the car and theres no other evidence to support what Mrs S says 
about being assured by the dealer that the seats were leather;
Mrs S inspected the car before it was supplied to her and she must have been 
satisfied with the seat covers or she wouldnt have entered into the hire purchase 
agreement and she drove the car for more than two years before she complained 
about the seat covers;
Black Horse arranged for the seat covers to be inspected by an independent expert 
in July 2019 and the experts report concluded, incorrectly:  the front and rear inter 
seats to be leather but the manufacturer has confirmed that the model of car that 
was supplied to Mrs S has seats covered with a branded man-made leather 
substitute and not real leather;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the price that was paid 
for the car included real leather seats or that Mrs S has been caused a financial loss 
because the seats arent covered in leather;
its clear that leather seats were important for Mrs S for the reasons that shes 
described and I sympathise with her for the disappointment and frustration that she 
now feels  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation of the car by dealer or that the car 
was mis-sold to Mrs S; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Black Horse to contribute all or any part of the cost of replacing the seat covers with 
real leather, to pay her any other compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 March 2021.
