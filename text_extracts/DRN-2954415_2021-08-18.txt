The complaint
Mr E complains that he was declined for a credit card by NewDay Ltd (NewDay).
What happened
In September 2020, Mr E applied for an Amazon credit card from NewDay. They declined 
his application.
Mr E complained. He wanted to know why he was declined. He now cant get the £10 gift 
card from Amazon  which was the incentive for getting a card.
NewDay said their decision to issue credit cards, or not, was based on several factors, 
including their internal risk policy and information from credit reference agencies. On this 
occasion, Mr E didnt meet their criteria.
Mr E brought his complaint to us. Our investigator initially said he would award Mr E 
compensation of £50  because NewDay couldnt evidence the eligibility checks theyd 
done. But after NewDay responded, he issued a second opinion and didnt uphold Mr Es 
complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr E applied for an Amazon credit card issued by NewDay. He was rejected at the eligibility 
stage  that is, the initial checks carried out by NewDay. He wants to know why he was 
turned down  as he wants to get the bonus offer of £10 for taking out an Amazon credit 
card.
NewDay  like all lenders  have their own criteria and processes for accepting or declining 
to take on customers. These also change from time to time, depending on their risk appetite 
and several other things like the economy. I can see that Mr E failed to get past their initial 
eligibility tests  if he had then he wouldve then gone through to the full credit application 
stage.
I have to say  that the acceptance criteria for lenders like NewDay is down to their own 
commercial judgement. In other words, its up to them to decide who they want to accept and 
who they dont. They dont have to tell us, or their prospective customers (like Mr E) what 
those criteria are  because theyre confidential, and commercially sensitive.
So  while I can see that this is frustrating for Mr E, Im afraid to say  because of that, I 
cant uphold Mr Es complaint. And I therefore, I wont be asking NewDay to do anymore 
here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 September 2021.
