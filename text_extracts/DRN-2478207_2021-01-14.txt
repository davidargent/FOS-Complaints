DRN-2478207
The complaint
Mr G has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) mis-sold him a fee-
paying Advantage Gold account which was later migrated to a Select Platinum account.
He has also complained that he tried to downgrade it multiple times, but NatWest 
refused to do so.
What happened
One of our ombudsmen has already issued a decision explaining why we are unable to 
look into Mr Gs complaint about the sale of his account. This decision will therefore only 
focus on Mr Gs complaint that he tried to downgrade his account, but NatWest refused to 
do so.
One of our adjudicators considered Mr Gs complaint about his attempts to downgrade his 
account to a fee-free account and he stated that he thought that NatWest set out the 
downgrade process to Mr G and he failed to follow it.
Mr G disagreed with the adjudicators findings and so the complaint has been passed to 
me for a final decision on that aspect of his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained our approach to complaints about packaged bank accounts on our 
website and Ive used that approach to help me decide this case. And having done so, I 
dont uphold this complaint. I will explain why.
Mr G says that when he complained that his account had been mis-sold in 2018, NatWest 
failed to downgrade his account. However, in its final response, NatWest said:
Next Steps
 
Your account remains as a Select Platinum Account to date and the next fee is due to debit 
on 24 May 2018. If you would like to see if an alternative account would better suit your 
needs, I would like to highlight that NatWest offers a range of accounts both with and without 
monthly account fees. The range of accounts available can be found online at 
www.natwest.com and you can find information on how to amend your account by searching 
change my account. Alternatively please contact the NatWest Conversion Team on 0800 
616 848 (opening hours Monday - Friday 8-8, Saturday 9-6, Sunday Closed). Or, if 
preferable, you can visit any NatWest Branch where an advisor will be happy to help.
 
Please note your account will remain a Select Platinum Account with a monthly fee 
unless we hear from you via the above methods. 
In NatWests follow up letter it said the following
As explained in our previous letter, to downgrade your account please visit our website 
www.natwest.com.  You can find information on how to amend the account by searching 
change my account.  Alternatively, please contact the NatWest Conversion Team on 0800 
616 848 (opening hours Monday to Friday 8-8 Saturday 9-6, Sunday closed.  Or, if 
preferable, you can visit any NatWest Branch where an advisor will be happy to help.
Looking at the letters NatWest sent to Mr G, Im satisfied that it was clearly explained to   
Mr G how he could go about downgrading his account, if he didnt want to keep the 
account.
I note that Mr G said in a letter after the final response that he wanted the charges 
cancelled. I also note that Mr G has provided evidence that he e-mailed the benefits team 
and asked for his account to be changed. But neither of these was the process highlighted 
to Mr G by NatWest on how to downgrade his account and in both instances, it was set out 
in response to these communications how Mr G could downgrade his account. I can see 
that Mr G in his e-mail to the benefits team said he could not phone as he was abroad but 
given that he was online to e-mail in the first instance I cant see why he could not change 
his account on NatWests website.
For me to be satisfied that NatWest should refund the account fees I would need to be 
satisfied that either NatWest failed to explain sufficiently how to downgrade the account or 
that it failed to downgrade the account if the correct process was followed. Overall based 
on the above I think that NatWest highlighted the process to downgrade the account and 
Mr G failed to follow this process. Because of this, Im unable to uphold Mr Gs complaint. 
My final decision
Because of the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 February 2021.
