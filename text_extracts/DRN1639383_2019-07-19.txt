One of our adjudicators looked  at this complaint and thought that QuickQuid should  put 
things right for Mrs D from the top-up  advance  to Loan 4 (September 2013)  until Loan 9 and 
all of the FlexCredit account. 
QuickQuid disagreed and sent several submissions  which can be distilled down to:
-  a criticism  of the fact that the adjudicators  view did not include a detailed  assessment of 
Mrs Ds income,  expenditure  and scrutiny of bank statements. QuickQuid goes so far as to 
say that it is incumbent  [on the adjudicator] to demonstrate that the loan was unaffordable 
and goes on to suggest that this services lack of analysis has led QuickQuid to disagree  
with the assessment; and
 - a non-acceptance of this services  approach  surrounding complaints involving repeat 
lending of high cost short term loans.
Following this the complaint was escalated for an ombudsmans decision, and QuickQuid 
has challenged this on the basis that it expected a response to its post-assessment 
submissions (outlined above) before  an ombudsman  considered it. 
Ref: DRN16393832Mrs D is represented by a third party and neither Mrs D nor her representative has disagreed  
with our adjudicators  assessment. So I take it from that Mrs D is content with the non-uphold 
opinion in relation to Loans 1 to 4 (before the first top-up). So I do not plan to review those 
loans as it appears they are undisputed. 
The complaint remaining  unresolved in part has been passed to me for a decision.  
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.  
We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending  - including  all 
of the relevant rules, guidance  and good  industry practice - on our website  and once again 
I refer QuickQuid to it.
The first point I address  is the challenge from QuickQuid that this ought not to have been 
referred to an ombudsman. I take it shortly as that is all the time needed to explain that our 
rules determine our procedure and it is not necessary to obtain  a partys agreement  for a 
complaint to become the subject of an ombudsmans  decision.  If the complaint  remains  
unresolved after an assessment  then it is quite correctly escalated. QuickQuids  reaction to 
the adjudicators  assessment was clearly  one of total disagreement and demonstrates  no 
narrowing of the issues in order to resolve  Mrs Ds particular complaint. So the complaint 
case for Mrs D has come  to my desk and I will decide. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs D 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. And I have seen that for Mrs Ds 
complaint QuickQuid has focussed on this in its post-assessment submissions  (outlined  
earlier). 
Ref: DRN16393833I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mrs D could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because sustainable within the context of lending  decisions is the ability  to  
repay without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments, without having to borrow 
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.  
Mrs D had declared an income of £1,200 a month. The additional  funds taken after Loan 4 
on 2 September  2013 led to a new repayment  figure  of £500 all of which was due on 
25 September 2013. I think  that this repayment sum represented a significant  part of her 
monthly income and QuickQuid probably  ought  to have checked some  additional  points to 
ensure Mrs D was able to repay that £500 three weeks later. I do not think QuickQuid  did 
that. It has said that it carried out credit checks but I have not received the results of those 
checks for September 2013 or any other  time for Mrs D. So I do not think  that QuickQuid has 
demonstrated to me that it was satisfied that Mrs D was able, in a sustainable  way, to repay 
the Loan 4 plus its top-up sums on 23 September 2013. 
Our adjudicator has expressed a view that Mrs Ds quick uptake behaviour around and 
following Loan 4 may have  been an indication that she was experiencing financial difficulty  at 
the time.  So she was persuaded  that Mrs D was unlikely to have been able to repay  this loan 
and the loans following on from it. QuickQuid has given me nothing to lead me to come to a 
different view. Mrs D took several loans in four months which actually  added  up to be eight 
advances of credit over that period, and in my view this was an indication that Mrs D was in 
need of cash and ought to have prompted reviews.
So I uphold Loans 4 (top-up advancement)  plus Loans 5 and 6. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mrs D, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid  should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, and that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ds case, I think  that this point was reached by 
Loan 7. Mrs D increased the amounts  of her loans from £100 for Loan  7 to £200  plus a top-
up at Loan 9. Then her FlexCredit account  limit approved was £750. So her indebtedness  
was increasing and I think that QuickQuid ought to have realised that it was more likely  than 
not that Mrs D was having to borrow further  to keep up with the debts. And so she was not 
really making any inroads  into the debts.
I think that Mrs D lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from the top-
up during Loan  4 and onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ds indebtedness by allowing  
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
Ref: DRN16393834the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mrs Ds ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept her in the market for these  
high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about Loans 7 to 9 plus the FlexCredit  account 
advances and QuickQuid  should put things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs D paid on Loans 4 (2 September top-up) to 
Loan 9 plus the FlexCredit account  advances;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement ;
remove any negative payment information about Loan 4 to Loan 6 from Mrs Ds 
credit file;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 7 onwards means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  Loans 7 to 9 plus the FlexCredit account 
should be removed  from Mrs Ds credit  file.
QuickQuid is able to offset the refund from the outstanding balance if there is one. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mrs D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
If QuickQuid intends  to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance,  it must 
do so after deducting  the tax.
my final decision
I uphold Mrs Ds complaint in part and CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid  should  
do as I have set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 August 2019.
