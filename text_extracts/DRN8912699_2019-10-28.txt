K822xcomplaint
Mrs F is complaining that FCE Bank Plc (trading as Ford Credit) (Ford Credit) is asking she 
pay charges after she returned a car she acquired through a hire purchase  agreement 
(agreement).
background 
In November 2015 Mrs F entered into an agreement with Ford Credit to acquire a car. 
Mrs F returned the car in January 2019  and it was inspected for damage and a report  
produced. The inspector  told Mrs F that there were damages which it considered  to be more  
than fair wear and tear and for this she would  be charged £814.27 by Ford Credit.
Mrs F signed the inspection report to say that although she agreed to the cars  return,  she 
didnt agree to Ford Credit charging  her £814.27.
Prior to the car being sold at auction, a second  inspection was carried out. This identified 
that there  were damages beyond fair wear and tear and for this Ford Credit could reasonably 
charge Mrs F £777.07.
Ultimately Ford Credit said it was prepared to accept from Mrs F £621.07 in full and final 
settlement of what it deemed to be damages  (on return of the car) beyond  fair wear and tear. 
This was based on the lower of the two reports undertaken of £777.07 less one damage 
charge of £156.00. 
Mrs F still didnt agree  with the sum Ford Credit was seeking from her so she asked us to 
investigate. On asking us to investigate,  Mrs F said she was prepared  to pay Ford Credit 
£261.20  this being what she understood to be the total cost of three of the damage 
charges Ford Credit  was seeking from her.
This complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that Ford Credit 
was entitled to seek from Mrs F £543.07,  this being  the sum of £621.07  less one further  
damage charge  of £78.00.
Ford Credit agreed with the investigators  conclusion  but Mrs F didnt. Therefore the 
complaint has been passed to me for review  and decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Im sorry to disappoint Mrs F, but Ive 
reached much the same conclusions as the investigator for broadly the same  reasons. 
I would also add that where  the parties disagree,  Ive made  my findings  on the balance of 
probabilities - in other words, what I think is most likely based on the evidence Ive seen and 
the wider circumstances. 
Ref: DRN89126992Ive looked at the agreement Mrs F signed. Im satisfied  this says she agreed to return  the 
car in good  condition and any damage beyond fair wear and tear is her responsibility. Ive 
also considered  the British Vehicle  Rental  and Leasing  Association (BVRLA) guidance and 
the two inspection reports.  
Ive summarised below the two inspection report findings.

13 Roof  contamination £0.00 £55.00 (£55.00)
Total (exclusive of VAT) £678.56 £647.56 £31.00
VAT £135.71 £129.51 £6.20
Total (inclusive of VAT) £814.27 £777.07 £37.20
The first inspection was carried  out on 14 January 2019 with Mrs F present. The second 
inspection was carried out on 17 January 2019  prior to the sale of the car at auction.
The investigator concluded that Ford Credit was entitled to seek from Mrs F £543.07, this 
being in respect  of items 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 in the above table less £37.20. Ford agreed, but 
Mrs F didnt.  Mrs F said she should only have to pay £148.27 for items 1,2 and 4 and not the 
£432.00 for items 3,5 and 6 (less  £37.20).
Ive carefully considered  all of the damage that the investigator concluded that Ford Credit 
could reasonably charge for. And having  done so, I can confirm that Im in agreement  with 
her.
Item 3 Rear Door L  dent
In my view the photograph provided  shows there  are multiple scratches to this item (many 
down to the bare metal) and such damage  isnt deemed,  according to the BVRLA guidance,  
acceptable.
Ref: DRN89126993Item 5 Rear Bumper  scuffed
In my view the photographs provided  shows there  are at least  three chips to this item (over  
3mm and/or  down to the primer) and such damage  isnt deemed, according to the BVRLA 
guidance, acceptable.
Item 6 Rear Door R  scratched
In my view the photograph provided  shows there  are multiple scratches to this item (many 
down to the bare metal) and such damage  isnt deemed,  according to the BVRLA guidance,  
acceptable.
Given what I say above I think its entirely reasonable for Ford Credit  to charge Mrs F for 
items I,2 and 4 (which  arent in dispute)  and charges  3,5 and 6 (which  are in dispute) less 
£37.20, equating to £543.07.
I understand Mrs F thinks some  of the damage  Ford Credit is now seeking payment for was 
damage that was present when she acquired the car in November 2015.  Now I accept I cant 
say for certain that Mrs F is wrong on this point. And I also accept that Ford Credit hasnt 
been able to provide any supporting documentation (such as photographs or checklists)  as 
to the condition of the car in 2015.  But on the balance  of probabilities, Im not persuaded by 
Mrs Fs submission in this respect.
Ive come to this conclusion because in my view, based on what has been said and 
submitted, that Mrs F wouldnt  have  acquired  a car for £8,999  which was less than a year 
old and which had travelled less than 8,000  miles  if the damages  that Ford Credit is now 
seeking payment  for (items 3,5 and 6) and which  are in dispute  were present at the time of 
acquisition.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my decision is FCE Bank Plc (trading as Ford Credit)  should 
reduce the damage charges its seeking  from Mrs F to £543.07 (as its has already agreed to 
do).
Having said the above, I would remind FCE Bank Plc (trading as Ford Credit) that if Mrs F is 
experiencing financial difficulties then its required to treat her in a positive and sympathetic 
manner when seeking recovery of the sum of £543.07.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 November  2019.
