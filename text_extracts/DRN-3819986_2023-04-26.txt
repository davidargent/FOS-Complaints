The complaint
Mr M complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr M entered into a credit card agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in February 2010 
to pay for some holiday club membership points. The amount of credit provided to him was 
£4,500. Mr M repaid that credit in July 2010. He used the credit agreement again in October 
2012 to obtain credit of £7,500 which he used to pay for some more holiday club 
membership points. That credit was repaid in January 2013. 
Mr M wrote to Barclays Partner Finance in January 2020 and said that it appeared that the 
credit intermediary wasnt permitted or authorised to arrange loans and he asked it to explain 
its position. Barclays Partner Finance didnt respond to that letter so Mr M wrote to it again in 
April and June 2020. He had a conversation with Barclays Partner Finance in June 2020 and 
it sent him a letter in which it asked him to provide a copy of the initial letter that hed sent to 
it. It also paid him £50 compensation for the distress and inconvenience that hed been 
caused.
Mr Ms representative wrote to this service in August 2021 and said, in summary and 
amongst other things, that the credit intermediary wasnt authorised to arrange the loan, the 
membership points were misrepresented to Mr M, there was an unfair relationship between 
Mr M and Barclays Partner Finance pursuant to section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act, 
there is no evidence that a credit check was conducted before the loan was granted and the 
high interest rate was also an indication of an unfair relationship. Those claims were 
forwarded by this service to Barclays Partner Finance and it then said that Mr M was out of 
time under the Limitation Act 1980 to make any claims under sections 75 and 140A of the 
Consumer Credit Act.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of Mr Ms section 75 claim to turn 
it down and that his section 140A claim was late under the Limitation Act 1980. He said that 
he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was irresponsible. He also 
said that there was no evidence to substantiate Mr Ms claim that the broker was 
unauthorised.
Mr Ms representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded in detail and has provided further comments about the 
authorisation and identity of the broker. It also, says, in summary and amongst other things, 
that:
Mr M couldnt have known until he brought the complaint, the details of the complaint 
he was making;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt respond to Mr Ms claims so any reliance on a 
response from it cant be accurate;
the enforcement of an unfair agreement is itself unfair, so that the debtor has a 
continuing cause of action which subsists as long as the agreement is current and 
Mr M has been pursued by the holiday company each year for payment of 
maintenance fees; and 
deliberate concealment also extends to include recklessness so its not necessary for 
Mr M to establish that the holiday company had actual knowledge that its 
concealment constituted an unfair agreement for him to rely on section 32 of the 
Limitation Act.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ms complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr M first raised his concerns about the authorisation of the credit intermediary with 
Barclays Partner Finance in January 2020 and I dont consider that his letter would 
properly be considered to be a complaint but Barclays Partner Finance didnt 
respond to those concerns;
the credit card agreement identifies a retailer but Mr Ms letter to Barclays Partner 
Finance refers to a different company as the credit intermediary  this services 
records show that the company referred to by Mr M as the credit intermediary was 
covered under the consumer credit jurisdiction in February 2010  which it wouldnt 
have been had it not been granted a consumer credit licence by the Office of Fair 
Trading;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the credit intermediary for the credit 
agreement was the company referred to by Mr M and I dont think that its 
unreasonable to conclude at this stage that, in the absence of any persuasive 
evidence to suggest otherwise, that the credit intermediary was the company 
identified by Mr M and that it was likely to have held the requisite licence when Mr M 
entered into the credit agreement and that the credit agreement was likely to be 
enforceable;
Mr M used the credit agreement to make payments in February 2010 and October 
2012 and he repaid the credit in January 2013 but he didnt contact Barclays Partner 
Finance about any issues with the authorisation of the credit intermediary until 
January 2020  about seven years later - I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect Mr M to have raised any concerns about the credit intermediary before then 
and I dont consider that its unreasonable that Barclays Partner Finance doesnt now 
have detailed information about the credit intermediary;
Mr Ms representatives letter to this service in August 2021 then also made claims 
under sections 75 and 140A and I accept that Mr Ms complaint was referred to this 
service within six years of those claims being made - but I need to consider whether 
the Limitation Act applies to those claims;Mr Ms claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ms claim under section 75 is that the holiday club points were misrepresented to 
him and that he wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been misrepresented to him 
- if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
Ive not been provided with copies of the purchase agreements that Mr M entered 
into to buy the membership points but the evidence shows that he paid for points in 
February 2010 and October 2012 and I consider that he could have made a claim to 
the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that 
he says induced him into buying the points in October 2012 as that was the latest 
time that any misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have 
been incurred as that the latest time that Barclays Partner Finance provided credit to 
him under the credit card agreement;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made to Barclays Partner 
Finance under section 75 until August 2021, more than eight years later which was 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that his section 75 
claim is now time-barred;
Mr Ms representative says that Mr M only became aware that he could make a 
misrepresentation claim to Barclays Partner Finance after he took advice from it  but 
I dont consider that the time that he had the knowledge to bring a claim assists him 
for the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some 
sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the 
time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are 
applicable to Mr Ms claims;
Mr Ms representative says that information was recklessly and deliberately 
concealed from Mr M so the time limits are postponed under section 32;
section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been 
deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the 
debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have 
been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a 
breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate 
concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
deliberate concealment of any relevant information in these circumstances so I dont 
consider that section 32 is applicable to Mr Ms claims; Mr Ms representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr M and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that the credit that was 
provided to Mr M in February 2010 was repaid in July 2010 and that the credit that 
was provided to him in October 2012 was repaid in January 2013  and Ive seen no 
evidence to show that Barclays Partner Finance provided any credit to Mr M after 
that time or that the credit card agreement was used after January 2013;
I consider that Mr M would have had six years from January 2013 to bring a section 
140A claim against either the holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a 
claim wasnt made about an unfair relationship between Mr M and Barclays Partner 
Finance until August 2021, more than eight years later which was outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that his claim under section 140A is 
also now time-barred; 
Im not persuaded that the holiday company pursuing Mr M each year for the 
payment of maintenance fees extends the period of time in which he could make a 
claim about his relationship with Barclays Partner Finance being unfair;
Mr Ms representative says that no credit checks were carried out by Barclays 
Partner Finance before the credit was provided to him  but the credit has been 
repaid and no credit has been provided by Barclays Partner Finance to Mr M under 
the credit card agreement since January 2013 and Ive seen no evidence to show 
that the credit that was provided to him wasnt affordable for him when it was made 
available to him or that hes experienced any financial difficulties since then;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr M asked Barclays Partner Finance for any 
information about its credit checks before August 2021 and, as he entered into the 
credit card agreement in February 2010, I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect him to have raised any concerns about the credit checks before then;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt issue a substantive response to Mr Ms concerns 
about the authorisation of the credit intermediary but, after it had had a conversation 
with him, it asked him to provide a copy of the initial letter that he sent to it and it paid 
him £50 compensation for the distress and inconvenience that hed been caused;
after it had received from this service a copy of Mr Ms representatives August 2021 
letter, it said that Mr Ms claims under sections 75 and 140A were out of time  
although I consider that it should have properly responded to Mr Ms concerns about 
the authorisation of the credit intermediary, I consider that it was fair and reasonable 
for it to say that his section 75 and 140A claims were out of time; and
I sympathise with Mr M for the issues that hes had with his holiday club membership, 
but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to him any of the money that he paid 
under the credit agreement, to pay him any further compensation or to take any other 
action in response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 May 2023.
