The complaint
Mr S complains that NewDay Ltd trading as John Lews Partnership Card declined his credit 
card application. Mr S also complains that NewDay didnt give him a clear explanation 
setting out why the application had been declined in good time. 
What happened
Mr S made two applications for a John Lewis Partnership credit card with NewDay in 
October 2022. Both applications were rejected by NewDay. NewDay provided basic 
information about the type of factors that could lead it to reject an application, including 
information found on Mr S credit file. 
Mr S spoke with NewDay about its decision to decline his application. During one of the 
calls, Mr S explained a utility supplier had registered a default on his credit file but that the 
energy ombudsman had directed the business to remove it. But despite completing a further 
application with NewDay Mr S wasnt approved for a credit card. 
Mr S complained and spoke with another agent at NewDay. During the call, Mr S explained 
that no one had given him a specific reason why his application had been declined and that 
if NewDay had done so he couldve taken steps to resolve the issue. 
NewDay issued three responses to Mr S complaint but didnt agree it had made a mistake 
or acted unfairly. NewDay said it had reviewed Mr S applications in line with its lending 
criteria but found he wasnt eligible. NewDay gave information concerning the sort of factors 
it considers, including details found on an applicants credit file. NewDay also recommended 
Mr S obtain a copy of his credit report so he could review the information contained. 
Mr S referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They thought 
NewDay had dealt with Mr S applications and complaint fairly and didnt ask it to take further 
action. Mr S asked to appeal, so his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware Ive summarised the events surrounding this complaint in less detail than the 
parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by my approach which reflects the informal 
nature of this service. I want to assure all parties Ive read and considered everything on file. 
Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every point raised to fairly reach my decision. And if 
I dont comment on something, its not because I havent considered it. Its because Ive 
focused on what I think are the key issues. My approach is in line with the rules we operate 
under.
Ive looked at the information available and listened to calls Mr S had with NewDay 
concerning his applications. I appreciate Mr S wanted to be given specific reasons why his 
application was declined so he could address them. But lenders wont normally provide a 
detailed explanation concerning the specific reasons why an application wasnt successful 
as doing so could be used to identify confidential lending criteria. But lenders are obliged to 
give broad explanations concerning the sorts of issues that may have affected a credit card 
application when notifying an applicant about its decision. 
NewDay has provided a copy of the message it sent Mr S when his applications were 
declined. The message contains general information about NewDays lending criteria along 
with advice on how to obtain a credit report from the credit reference agencies. So whilst I 
understand Mr S wanted to NewDay to give a specific reason at the outset, Im satisfied it 
did give him guidance on why his application was unsuccessful. 
When Mr S called NewDay after his first application he explained there was a default on his 
credit file for around Â£200 that related to an energy bill. But Mr S said the energy 
ombudsman had told the reporting business to remove the default. As a result, the agent Mr 
S spoke with reset the application to allow him to reapply. Having listened to the call, I think 
the agent was of the view the utility supplier had been told the remove the default in the 
period after Mr S made his first credit card application was made. I appreciate the default 
remained on Mr S credit file, but I think the agents advice to reapply was made on the basis 
they thought the default had been removed. 
I also think its fair to say Mr S appears to have been aware of the default showing on his 
credit file and the impact it mayve had on his credit card application. I appreciate Mr S has 
told us the default was recorded on his credit file in error and shouldve been removed. But 
Im satisfied it remained on his credit file at the point he made applications to NewDay so it 
was reasonable for it to factor that in when considering whether to proceed. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr S but I havent been persuaded that NewDay treated him 
unfairly or made a mistake when it declined his applications. Ultimately, Im satisfied 
NewDay correctly applied its lending criteria. As Im satisfied NewDay dealt with Mr S 
complaint fairly, Im not telling it to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr S complaint. Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or reject my decision before 
8 August 2023.
