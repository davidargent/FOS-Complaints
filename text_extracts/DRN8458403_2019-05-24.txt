K820x#14complaint
This complaint is about a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy  taken out with a credit 
card in 1997. Mr J says NewDay Ltd mis-sold  him the PPI.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Js case.
Ive decided the policy wasnt mis-sold. Ill explain  why. 
Mr J hasnt said much about  why he was thinks he was mis-sold PPI, other  than he didnt 
want the policy, so Ive thought about  whether he was given a choice in taking out the 
PPI. NewDay has provided  a copy of his credit card application, and I can see on this 
that the PPI is presented as an optional  product   and has been selected with a tick. 
Mr J has then signed to confirm  his selection   which is separate to his signature for the 
card. With this in mind, I think that NewDay did enough to show that PPI was an optional 
product, and that Mr J chose to take it out. 
NewDay didnt recommend the PPI to Mr J so it didnt have to check  if it was right for 
him. But it did have  to make sure Mr J got the information  he needed to decide if it was 
right for him. 
Its possible the information NewDay gave Mr J about the PPI wasnt as clear  as it 
shouldve been. But he chose  to take out the PPI - so it looks like he wanted this type of 
cover. Based  on what Ive seen of his circumstances at the time it doesnt look like he 
was affected by any of the exclusions to or limits on the PPI cover - so it would have 
been useful for him if something  went  wrong. It also looks  like the PPI was affordable.  So 
I dont think better  information  about  the PPI would  have put him off taking out the cover. 
This means NewDay doesnt  have to pay back all of the cost of the PPI to Mr J.
But NewDay  will pay back some  of the cost of the PPI to Mr J because: 
NewDay got a high level of commission and profit  share (more than 50% of the PPI 
premium) - so it should have told Mr J about that. Because NewDay didnt  tell Mr J, that 
was unfair. 
To put that right, NewDay  has basically offered to pay back  the amount of commission  
and profit share that was above  50% of the PPI premium - and I think that offer is fair in 
this case.
Ive thought about everything Mr J has said - but these  points  dont change  my decision, and 
for the reasons set out above,  I dont  think the PPI was mis-sold.
what the business needs  to do
Ref: DRN84584032NewDay has to pay back to Mr J any commission and profit share it got that was more  than 
50% of the PPI premium. NewDay should  also pay back to Mr J any extra interest he paid 
because of that.
NewDay should re-work the credit card account  and pay back  to Mr J the difference between  
what Mr J owes  and what he wouldve owed if the commission  and profit  share it got hadnt 
been over 50% of the cost of the PPI. NewDay should also pay Mr J 8%* simple  interest  if 
he paid off their credit  card at some point.
*Businesses have to take basic rate tax off this interest. Mr J can claim back the tax he doesnt pay tax.
my final decision
The PPI policy wasnt mis-sold  so NewDay Ltd does not have to pay back  all of the cost of 
the PPI to Mr J.
But NewDay  Ltd does  have to pay back to Mr J any commission and profit  share it got that 
was more than 50% of the PPI premium.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 June  2019.
