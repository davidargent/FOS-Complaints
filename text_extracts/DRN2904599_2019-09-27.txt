Mr P says that he first took out payday loans as he needed  money  to pay his priority  bills. He 
says he couldnt  get a loan from his bank because he had a poor credit  score.  After  taking  
out the loans he says he needed to borrow more money to meet  the repayments. He says 
that taking out new loans  was easy and that he was offered higher amounts without any 
checks. He says the loans were unaffordable and made his financial situation worse. 
Lending Stream says before the loans were provided it carried  out checks of Mr Ps monthly 
income and expenses including his other credit commitments. It also carried  out identity and 
credit checks. It says that based on the information gathered it was reasonable that the 
loans were provided apart form the final loan which it says was unsuitable  for Mr P. It offered 
to close this loan account.
Our adjudicator didnt  think he had enough  evidence to say that loans one to four shouldnt 
have been provided. However he thought that by the time loan five was provided Mr Ps 
overall pattern  of borrowing  suggested he had become  persistently  reliant  on the loans. 
Because of this he upheld this case in regard to loans  five to 11.
Lending Stream didnt  accept our adjudicators view. It confirmed its offer to write off the 
outstanding balance on the final loan and record this loan as settled and closed on Mr Ps 
credit file was still available. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Ref: DRN29045992MyJar needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MyJar should fairly  and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower  a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MyJar was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans  - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
Our adjudicator said that he didnt have enough evidence  to say that the first four loans 
shouldnt have been provided and I agree  with this.
However by the time the fifth loan was provided,  Mr P had taken out five loans in around 
seven months. The amounts  he was borrowing werent decreasing  and he was taking out 
new loans shortly after repaying previous ones. I think this should  have raised  concerns that 
Mr P was struggling to manage his finances  and that he had become reliant  on short term 
loans. Because  of this I agree with our adjudicator that this complaint should be upheld  in 
regard to loans  five to 11.
The final loan has not been repaid. In its response to this complaint Lending Stream has 
confirmed its offer to close  this account. I find this reasonable and this will form part of the 
overall redress.
Ref: DRN29045993my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans  five to 11. If MYJAR 
Limited has sold the outstanding debt it should buy this back.  If it is not able or willing to do 
so then it should liaise with the new debt owner  to achieve the results outlined below.
MYJAR Limited should:
1.refund  all interest and charges applied to loans five to ten along with 8% simple interest* 
from the date of payment to the date of settlement ;
2.remove all interest and charges from the outstanding balance  of loan 11 and treat any 
payments Mr P made towards  this loan as though they were  towards  the outstanding 
principal; 
3.if the action in point 2 above results in Mr P having made an overpayment this should  be 
refunded;
4.if following the action  in point 2 above  there  is still a principal amount outstanding this 
should be written off as per Lending Streams offer. The amount written  off can be offset 
against the total refund due to Mr P;
5.as the number of loans  taken  from loan five means any information recorded about them 
is adverse all entries about loans five to 11 should  be removed from Mr Ps credit file 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR Limited  to deduct tax from this interest. It should 
give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax has been deducted, if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 October  2019.
