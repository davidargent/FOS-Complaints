The complaint
Mr and Mrs S complain that Avantia Insurance Limited trading as HomeProtect gave them 
incorrect information in connection with a claim they made on their buildings insurance 
policy.
What happened
Mr S has led the complaint with this Service so Ive referred to him mainly throughout. 
References to Mr S and HomeProtect include respective representatives and agents.
The background to this complaint is well known to the parties, so Ive provided a summary 
here.
Mr Ss property is insured under a buildings insurance policy issued by an insurer, 
which Ill refer to as A. He purchased the policy through HomeProtect, an insurance 
intermediary. 
Mr S reported some cracks to his property and the insurer undertook an investigation 
which concluded the cause of the damage was as a result of the lack of a lateral 
restraint within the walls, apparently common within buildings the age of Mr Ss. The 
claim was declined as this wasnt an insured peril.
When Mr S received the renewal paperwork for the policy from HomeProtect, this 
detailed a claim and on further enquiry, HomeProtect said it was a claim for 
subsidence. 
Mr S decided not to renew his policy with HomeProtect but having tried to obtain 
quotes from various insurers, found he was unable to obtain cover elsewhere 
because of the apparent subsidence claim. He says he felt he had to stay with 
HomeProtect and accept the higher premium. 
Mr C complained to HomeProtect and ultimately raised a complaint with this Service. 
Our Investigator asked HomeProtect to provide its side of the story but despite 
chasing it, no information was received so the Investigator reached his findings 
based on what information he did have available. 
He concluded the claim recorded was actually for accidental damage not for 
subsidence, so HomeProtect had given incorrect information to Mr S when hed 
phoned it to clarify things. This had caused Mr S distress and inconvenience and he 
said HomeProtect should pay £200 to recognise this impact.  
HomeProtect didnt respond to the findings so the complaint has come to me for an 
Ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our powers to consider complaints are set out in the Financial Services and markets 
Act 2000 (FSMA) and in rules known as the Dispute Resolution rules (DISP) written 
by the Financial Services Authority (FCA) in accordance with the powers it derives 
from FSMA. These form part of the FCA handbook.
DISP 3.5.9 explains 
The Ombudsman may
(3) reach a decision on the basis of what has been supplied and take account 
of the failure by a party to provide information requested
Our Investigator requested HomeProtects file on 30 March 2023 but received no 
response. He chased it on 14 April 2023 and explained he would proceed on the 
basis of what he had if HomeProtect didnt provide its file by the extended deadline. 
He still didnt receive anything, so he issued his findings on 20 April 2023 and asked 
the parties to let him know if they accepted his recommendations. There was still no 
response from HomeProtect so, on 3 May 2023 he issued a further reminder to 
HomeProtect together with a copy of the findings but there was still no response.
Im satisfied HomeProtect has had ample opportunity and time to provide us with its 
side of the story  including its phone call with Mr S when it provided the information 
about how the claim was recorded. I see no reason to delay things any longer, so in 
accordance with the DISP rule Ive detailed above, Im proceeding with my decision 
on the basis of the evidence I have available.
Mr S raised a separate complaint about A and during the investigation into that 
complaint, our Investigator found the claim had actually been recorded as accidental 
damage. But Mr S says when he clarified things with HomeProtect, it told him the 
claim was recorded as subsidence.
This led to him disclosing a subsidence claim to a number of insurers when seeking 
alternative policies. He says he experienced distress when he found no other insurer 
was willing to provide cover because of this and I understand why this would be the 
case.
He was also concerned about the impact of having to disclose a recorded 
subsidence claim when selling the property. I can see why this would have further 
added to the distress.
For the reasons Ive explained Ive not been able to listen to his call with 
HomeProtect, but I find Mr Ss testimony persuasive. And in the absence of any 
evidence to the contrary, I think its more likely than not HomeProtect did provide 
Mr S with the incorrect information which led to him experiencing distress and 
inconvenience. 
And as a consequence, Im upholding this complaint and directing HomeProtect to 
pay Mr S £200 in recognition of this.
Because the claim had actually been recorded correctly, Im satisfied HomeProtects 
error had no impact on the premium quoted at renewal.My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct Avantia Insurance Limited trading 
as HomeProtect to pay Mr and Mrs S £200 for the distress and inconvenience it caused 
them.
Avantia Insurance Limited trading as HomeProtect must pay the compensation within 28 
days of the date on which we tell it Mr and Mrs S accept my final decision. If it pays later 
than this it must also pay interest on the compensation from the deadline date for settlement 
to the date of payment at 8% a year simple
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision before 7 July 2023.
