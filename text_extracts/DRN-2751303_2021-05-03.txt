DRN-2751303
The complaint
Mr A complains that he was unable to access his NewDay Ltd account whilst abroad.
What happened
Mr A says he couldnt access his account online or via his banking application (app) whilst in 
the Ukraine. He says he called NewDay from Ukraine and spent 90 minutes on that call. Mr 
A says he needed to make a payment to his account and says its unfair that he cant access 
his account whilst in certain countries. He would like his call costs refunded.
NewDay says Mr A told it on the call he had been waiting for 20 minutes and then spent 
about seven minutes on the call to it. It doesnt accept making a mistake and says customers 
cant access their online line accounts in Ukraine.
Mr A brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought it up to NewDay to decide if it restricts account access in these circumstances and 
NewDay had told Mr A about those restrictions in a previous complaint. The investigator 
didnt think there were any late payment fees or charges and that the call took about 28 
minutes not 90 minutes as Mr A said. The investigator thought the call was dealt with 
appropriately.
Mr A doesnt accept that view and doesnt recall being told about the access problem in 
Ukraine. He says that policy is unfair in any event and he should have his call costs 
refunded.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint. I 
appreciate Mr A will be disappointed by my decision. I also make clear to Mr A that we are 
not NewDays regulator and so its not our role to tell it how it exercises its commercial 
judgement on decision such as this to block some account access from certain countries. 
And its not our role to tell NewDay that such matters should be included in account terms 
and conditions. I have listened to the telephone call between our investigator and Mr A and 
am aware of what he told us about the investigators view.
I have looked at NewDays letters about Mr As similar complaint in 2018 and our response 
to it in 2019. Im satisfied it was made clear to Mr A in both letters that NewDay had in place 
account restrictions that operate in Ukraine. I appreciate Mr A says he forgot about that but 
that is not something I can fairly hold NewDay responsible for or that it could reasonably 
have known that Mr A had forgotten that information. So, I dont think NewDay made a 
mistake by having the account restrictions in place and in any event, I dont think there was 
any significant impact on Mr A as he didnt receive any account charges or late payment 
fees.
I have listened to the telephone call between Mr A and NewDay. Im satisfied Mr A told 
NewDay that he had been on hold for 20 Minutes and the actual call took about 8 minutes. 
So, whilst I appreciate Mr A says the call including waiting time took about 90 minutes, I 
dont think that was the case. I dont think that was an unreasonable length of time and in 
any event, I have not seen any evidence about the call costs from Mr A. I find NewDay dealt 
appropriately with Mr A during that call.
Overall, Im satisfied that NewDay has dealt fairly with this complaint and hasnt made a 
mistake. I also think Mr A ought reasonably to have been aware of the account access 
issues whilst in Ukraine as he had been told about them on at least two occasions. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 May 2021.
