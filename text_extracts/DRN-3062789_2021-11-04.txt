The complaint
Mr G complains Advanced Payment Solutions Limited trading as CashPlus unfairly blocked 
his account without contacting him, held on to his funds for too long, and then closed his 
account. He wants compensation for the distress he was caused.
What happened
Mr G had a CashPlus account. In April 2020 he says a business associate transferred a sum 
of money to his account from their credit card. Mr Gs income from his business was limited 
at that time due to the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. So, he borrowed the 
money to help him through a difficult period but then had to transfer the funds to his business 
account to pay urgent bills.
Mr G says things improved in July 2020 and he transferred a larger sum of money from his 
business account to his CashPlus account to repay the debt owed to his associate and to 
repay other personal debts. But when Mr G went to access his account, he discovered it was 
blocked.
CashPlus blocked Mr Gs account to undertake a review. It asked him for proof of the source 
of funds for the payment made by his associate in April. Mr G sent a credit card statement 
which CashPlus considered as part of its review. After several weeks it returned the funds 
which represented the payment he made in July back to his business account. 
During the review Mr G contacted CashPlus and was told he couldnt access his account 
due to an IT issue, and it couldnt provide him with further information as a result. Mr G 
complained. CashPlus apologised to Mr G in its final response letter. 
CashPlus decided to close Mr Gs account and gave him 60 days notice, although his 
account remained blocked. During the notice period CashPlus contacted him and asked him 
to get in touch. Mr G says CashPlus communication was contradictory. But CashPlus says it 
wanted to arrange the transfer of the small remaining balance it still held.
An investigator at our service didnt uphold Mr Gs complaint. They found:
There wasnt an IT error which prevented Mr G from accessing the funds he paid into 
the account. CashPlus instead restricted the account to conduct a review in line with 
its legal and regulatory obligations. It returned the funds back to his business account 
after completing its review.
CashPlus decision to restrict Mr Gs account was reasonable and done to comply 
with its legal and regulatory obligations. So, while this caused Mr G frustration, its 
actions werent unfair, and it didnt cause an unreasonable delay.
CashPlus could close Mr Gs account. But even though Mr G couldnt access the 
account during the notice period, there was only a small balance left on the account. 
So, it wasnt clear compensation was warranted. He may have found the 
communication he had with CashPlus confusing, but CashPlus had contacted him to 
discuss transferring the remaining balance before the account closed.
Mr G disagreed with the outcome the investigator reached. He says there was an IT error 
and media reports and wider evidence shows many other CashPlus customers were 
affected. So, the reason he couldnt access his funds wasnt because of the review. 
Mr G asked for a final decision from an ombudsman, so the complaint has been given to me 
to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Gs complaint. Ill explain why:
The reason why Mr G couldnt access his account was because his account was 
being reviewed. I do not find it was due to an IT issue. CashPlus did experience an IT 
issue in 2018 which is documented in multiple media reports. But the evidence I have 
seen clearly establishes CashPlus intentionally restricted Mr Gs access to his 
account for the purposes of its review.
CashPlus confused matters in its response to Mr Gs complaint. It apologised for 
technical issues which meant his access to the account was affected and 
information could not be provided. This wasnt accurate. It should have revealed it 
had restricted his account until at least its review was completed.
I dont doubt CashPlus employees couldnt tell Mr G what was happening on his 
account. Quite often account reviews are dealt with by specific departments, and 
information about what is happening is treated in confidence and not shared outside 
of that department for valid reasons.
CashPlus restricted Mr Gs account in July 2020 and not April 2020. It didnt need to 
give him prior notice. It wouldnt have known what the outcome of its review would 
be. It might have decided to take further action in relation to the funds in the account, 
so warning Mr G beforehand could have prevented it acting.
CashPlus must review accounts to comply with important regulatory and legal 
responsibilities. Those responsibilities generally concern monitoring accounts to 
ensure activity is genuine, and to prevent financial harm where possible. And, its 
common industry practice to restrict accounts when carrying out a review. Ive 
considered CashPlus reason(s) for undertaking a review and restricting Mr Gs 
account and its decision was reasonable. 
CashPlus is under no obligation to reveal the reason(s) for its review or the steps it 
took during the review. This must be frustrating for Mr G, but I understand why 
CashPlus hasnt revealed anything more than it has. And, I am not going to direct it 
to reveal its reason(s) now.
Mr G says he needed the funds in his account urgently. But I dont find his need was 
such that CashPlus ought not to have restricted his account or have forgone its 
review. I find it acted as it should have, and it returned the payment Mr G made soon 
after it completed its reviewCashPlus gave 60 days notice to close Mr Gs account. But Mr G couldnt access the 
account during the notice period, so to some extent this was like closing his account 
immediately. But I find 60 days was still enough time to open another account 
elsewhere if he didnt have another personal account. And there is little evidence to 
show not having access to the small balance left on the account caused him 
problems which warrant compensation.
My final decision
I have decided not to uphold Mr Gs complaint for the reasons I have given above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2021.
