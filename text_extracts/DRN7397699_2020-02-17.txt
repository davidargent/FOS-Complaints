Mr B complains Elevate  Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him 
irresponsibly.
Background

Subsequently, Sunny  says it then lent loans 11 to 17 between  26 November 2017  and
30 December 2017 and that these  ranged  between £100 and £300.   
Our adjudicator thought that loans 6 to 17 shouldnt  have  been given to Mr B. Sunny 
disagreed and the complaint has now been  referred  to me to consider. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny had to assess Mr Bs applications  for borrowing to check if he could afford to pay 
back the amounts  hed borrowed  without  undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which 
was proportionate to the circumstances.  Sunnys checks could have taken into account  a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments 
and Mr Bs income and expenditure.  With this in mind, I think  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, less thorough checks might have been  proportionate.
Ref: DRN73976992But certain factors might  suggest  Sunny should  have  done more to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for Mr B. These  factors include:
Mr B having a low income  (reflecting  that it could be more  difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr B having a large number of loans and/or having these loans  over a long 
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr B coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive  of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr B.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mr B could sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether he technically  had enough  money to make  his repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments  could of course  be an indicator that Mr B was able to repay his 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically  follow that this is the case.  The FCAs 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if they are made 
without undue difficulties  and in particular, made on time, while  meeting other reasonable 
commitments and without having  to borrow  to make them. If a lender realises, or ought 
reasonably to have  realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without 
borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude  those  repayments  are 
unsustainable.
Ive considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Bs complaint.
Loan 1, a relatively modest loan, was taken out and repaid over the contractual  term. It was 
over two weeks later before Mr B then applied  for his second  loan for the same  amount 
(£200). There was subsequently a sharp increase in the frequency of lending, such that 
when Mr B had applied for loan 6 (around  8 months into the lending relationship with Sunny), 
it was the fifth occasion in 6 weeks that he taken out loans  with 4 loans being taken out in 
October 2017. When loans 3 to 6 were lent, previous lending was also outstanding, so Mr B 
would have needed to pay multiple repayments  across his loans. 
I think Mr Bs pattern of borrowing by loan 6 should  have  suggested  to Sunny that he didnt 
just have a short-term cash-flow  problem, but a persistent shortage  of funds  which he was 
borrowing in order to top up. High-cost,  short-term loans of the kind offered by Sunny are not 
suitable for this kind of use. I think Sunny should  have recognised the signs Mr B was likely 
using the loans in this way. 
Loan 7 was then taken  out a week after loan 6 was repaid, with loan 5 still outstanding. In 
fact, most of the subsequent  loans  were taken out whilst other  lending  hadnt been repaid.  
And the frequency of lending also became  more  persistent with Mr B taking out 5 loans in 
November 2017  and 6 loans in December 2017. 
Ref: DRN73976993During the lending relationship the loan amounts also remained broadly the same.  The loans 
ranged from £100 to £300, with over half the loans taken out for £200. Several loans were 
also taken out shortly after repayment  of previous loans.  I think the pattern indicated Mr B 
was regularly running out of money  and having  to borrow  to meet  his other  financial 
commitments, rather than seeking assistance  for a temporary cash  flow problem. Ive also 
considered that after loan 2 was taken out, there  were only a few days when Mr B wasnt  
indebted. Overall, he wasnt making any real inroads  into what  he owed Sunny.   
Taking all of this into account,  I agree with the adjudicator that it was unlikely Mr B would be 
able to repay loans  6 to 17 sustainably. I think Sunny should also have recognised  that Mr B 
was most likely not using  these loans for the short-term purpose  they were  marketed and 
intended for. 
So I dont  think Sunny should  have  lent loans 6 to 17.  
Putting things  right
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr B loans 6 to 17. So its not right that he should  have  had to 
pay interest, fees or charges on these, or have  them affect his credit  file in a negative way. 
So to put things right Sunny should:
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr B towards interest,  fees and 
charges on these loans.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Mr B which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr B originally  made the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled.
C) Pay Mr B the total of A plus B.
D) The overall pattern  of borrowing for loans 6 to 17 means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse,  so these should be removed entirely from Mr Bs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mr B a certificate  showing  how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Bs complaint  in part and direct Elevate Credit International Limited (trading  as 
Sunny) to take the actions outlined in the putting things right section above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 March  2020.
