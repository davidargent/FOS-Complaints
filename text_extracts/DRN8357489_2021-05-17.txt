K821x#15complaint
Mr W has complained that CarCashPoint Limited lent to him irresponsibly. He has also
complained that CarCashPoint has treated unfairly in other ways.
background
I issued a provisional decision about this complaint  in February  2021  that I summarise  
below.
Mr W was given a logbook loan of £630 by CarCashPoint in November 2018. The loan was
secured against  a vehicle that he owned.
The loan was due to be repaid in 78 weekly instalments of around £22.00.  The total amount
to be repaid including interest was just over £1,764.
Mr W complained  that he shouldnt have been  given the loan because  he was in
financial difficulties and that he has paid a large  amount of unfair charges on his account. 
One of our adjudicators had looked into Mr Ws complaint. He didnt think CarCashPoint  had
been wrong to provide the loan. But he thought that the lender hadnt  treated Mr W fairly in
relation to some of the additional charges  it had applied to his account. 
CarCashPoint didnt  agree with the adjudicators assessment overall, but it agreed to 
partially refund some  of the additional late payment charges it had applied to Mr Ws 
account. Mr W thought he shouldnt have been given the loan and he didnt accept 
CarCashPoints offer of a partial refund of charges.
The matter  passed  to me to decide.
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, in particular the checks  that 
CarCashPoint needed to do such as the amount  being lent, and the consumers income and 
expenditure. 
I considered some overarching questions in order to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this particular complaint:
Did CarCashPoint complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr W would  be able to repay his loan in a sustainable way? If not, what  would 
reasonable and proportionate checks have shown at the time?
Ultimately  did it make  a fair lending decision?
Did CarCashPoint act unfairly  or unreasonably towards Mr W in some  other  way?
CarCashPoint needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didn't lend irresponsibly. 
The lender  had to carry out proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr W could repay the 
loan in a sustainable way, but there was no set list of the checks it had to do. 
CarCashPoint asked  Mr W for information about  his income and expenditure and it
asked him to provide some bank statements.  Mr W told the lender that he had
experienced a reduction in his income due to illness, but that he had returned to full time
work with two jobs.
Ref: DRN83574892Id seen a summary  of the information gathered  by CarCashPoint  at the time and I 
considered whether the information  gathered  should  reasonably  have triggered any further 
checks. On balance, I didnt think it did. From  the evidence Id seen, I thought  the checks  
that CarCashPoint carried out were reasonable  and proportionate, in the circumstances.
Mr Ws bank statements  showed occasional returned direct debits, but his current  account
remained largely in credit; there  are no significant  signs of financial distress  such  as
frequently returned requests for payment or high bank charges for an unarranged or
arranged overdraft. Nor are there any indications of regular or frequent borrowing from
multiple short-term lenders, significant  gambling  or a very substantial  overdraft - all of which
might have signalled severe financial difficulties. Mr W had borrowed from at least one other 
short-term lender. But I didnt think there was sufficient evidence  that his borrowing from 
other lenders was such that it ought  reasonably  to have  led CarCashPoint  to decline his loan 
application.
I noted that Mr W was regularly transferring sums  in and out of his savings account  and he 
may have  been  spending  more than he had estimated with CarCashPoint.  But in the 
circumstances, I couldnt  fairly say that CarCashPoint ought reasonably to have concluded 
that Mr W was having such severe difficulties  managing his finances that it would be 
irresponsible to lend to him.
Mr W says he had a number of outstanding  County  Court Judgments  at the time. But Id not
seen enough evidence to confirm this. He also says that CarCashPoint  ought to have
realised from his bank  statements that he hadnt  been receiving his normal  income.  But Mr
W explained in an email  to CarCashPoint why his income had been lower than usual, and
he confirmed that he had returned to normal work.  I think  in the circumstances, it was fair
and reasonable for the lender to rely on his explanation  about  this. Overall, I couldnt  fairly 
say that CarCashPoint made an unfair  lending decision when it agreed to provide Mr W with 
the loan.
Did CarCashPoint act unfairly  or unreasonably in some other  way?
Mr Ws loan account went into arrears. Hes unhappy that additional charges were  applied to
his account when CarCashPoint said it was going to repossess  his vehicle. In the event, Mr
W paid funds into his account to stop the repossession but he still had to pay the additional
charges and he thinks this is unfair.
I thought carefully  about this. CarCashPoint was entitled under the terms of its agreement
with Mr W to initiate and enforce recovery action  because  Mr W had defaulted on his
repayments and was in breach of his contract. CarCashPoint says that the recovery charge
was applicable when recovery action was instructed. The lender  says this happened  when
Mr Ws account had reached  just over 12 weeks of arrears.
Mr W isnt happy that CarCashPoint applied £150  admin charges  and £300  to cover third
party costs.  Having been warned that recovery action had been instructed,  Mr W made  a
payment into his account a few days later to stop his vehicle being repossessed.
CarCashPoint says that once recovery action has been instructed, any funds then received
had to be paid to the recovery  agents  first to cancel or hold the recovery  action. I thought  
that the recovery action was only instructed because Mr W had fallen behind  in his 
obligations to CarCashPoint  and he made a last-minute payment into his account to stop the 
action. I thought its likely that CarCashPoint did incur costs during this process and it has 
Ref: DRN83574893explained why such costs were incurred. Overall,  I didnt think  CarCashPoint treated Mr W 
unfairly when it applied additional charges to his account when it instructed recovery action.
CarCashPoint accepted that it ought not to have continued charging late payment fees after
the recovery action  was instructed. It told us that three such fees were removed from
Mr Ws account but around £114  of fees were  retained and paid by Mr W. I thought  that by 
the time that recovery  action was triggered,  CarCashPoint would reasonably have been 
aware that Mr W was having  serious difficulties managing to repay his account. And it wasnt 
fair or reasonable  in the circumstances of this case to continue charging  late payment fees. 
So, I said CarCashPoint needs  to put things  right.
Mr W is also unhappy that he later received a letter from CarCashPoint  which  included the
offer of a repeat  customer discount. He thought it was inappropriate for CarCashPoint to
encourage him to take a further loan, given  that the lender was aware hed struggled to
repay his first loan.  Mr W thinks CarCashPoint was acting irresponsibly in offering him repeat
lending and that it went against good lending practice.
I understood why Mr W might have thought that CarCashPoint was being insensitive in
making him aware of its repeat customer discount when it wrote to him to confirm the loan
was settled. But businesses do sometimes send automatically generated letters which  arent
always geared to a particular customers specific circumstances. I thought that is whats 
likely to have happened here. I didnt think Mr W lost out because  CarCashPoint advertised 
this potential discount to him.
Mr W raised several different  complaint  points  over the course  of this matter,  and he feels  
very strongly  about his complaint. I explained  that my provisional decision focussed on what 
I considered to be the material  issues.
I said that I was not intending to uphold Mr Ws complaint about the loan or about  the 
charges that he had to pay in relation to the recovery action that had been instructed.
But I did think that CarCashPoint  treated  Mr W unfairly when it continued  to apply late 
payment fees to his account after it had instructed  the recovery  action.  
I invited both parties to send me any further comments or evidence. 
I have not seen any further comment  from CarCashPoint and the deadline for providing  
further information has now passed.
Mr W has provided some further comments and information. He doesnt think my provisional 
decision is fair or reasonable. In summary Mr W says that:
CarCashPoint should have realised from his bank account statements that he wasnt  
in a healthy financial position.  He had a returned direct  debit  of around £41 shortly 
before the loan and his balance was only just over £29.00.
Mr W has provided screenshots from a credit  report  showing he had a number of 
CCJs. Mr W also says he had outstanding and defaulted payments with other 
creditors and a poor credit rating. He thinks CarCashPoint would have had access to 
this information  at the time.
Mr W thinks the admin fee and recovery charges were  unfair  and could not have 
been based on actual costs incurred  by CarCashPoint.
He also says that he was belittled by CarCashPoint and not treated sympathetically 
when he said he was struggling to repay his loan.
Ref: DRN83574894my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to thank both parties for all the information  that has been provided about  this matter 
and Mr W for responding to my provisional  decision. 
I dont think the recently returned direct debit or a low balance on Mr Ws account when he 
took the loan ought  reasonably to have signalled severe financial distress to CarCashPoint.  
And Ive explained  in my provisional  decision why I dont  think that CarCashPoint  ought  
reasonably to have  concluded from Mr Ws bank account statements that he was having 
such severe difficulties managing his finances  that it would be irresponsible  to lend to him. 
Mr W has now provided more information about  his CCJs, some of which had been satisfied 
but at least one was outstanding at the time of the loan. Hes also told us he thinks 
CarCashPoint should have seen from his credit  report  that he had defaults and outstanding 
debts. I have thought carefully about  this. However,  generally, the information  a consumer 
might see, when they request a copy of their credit  file, might be very different to that seen 
by a lender. A lender might only see a portion of the credit file, or some data might be 
missing or anonymised,  or the data might not be up to date. So, this may explain any 
differences between  the information provided by the lenders credit checks  and the 
information Mr W says it should have seen. Overall,  I cannot fairly  say that Ive seen 
sufficient evidence for me to say that CarCashPoint ought reasonably  to have decided not to 
lend to Mr W.
I have also explained  in my provisional  decision that even though Mr W thinks the admin fee 
and recovery charges were unfair, the recovery action was only instructed because hed 
fallen behind  in his obligations to CarCashPoint and hed made a last-minute  payment into 
his account to stop the action. I do think its likely that CarCashPoint  incurred costs during 
this process and it has given an explanation for this. Mr W might think these are unfeasibly 
high. But his further comments have not changed  my view that, overall, I dont think  
CarCashPoint treated Mr W unfairly  when it applied additional charges to his account  when it 
instructed recovery action.
I understand why Mr W may be unhappy about  the tone of correspondence  from 
CarCashPoint and he may feel that he was given poor customer service.  But I think  it is 
useful here to reflect on the role of this service.  This service isnt intended to regulate or 
punish businesses  for their conduct  or poor customer relations  that is the role of the 
Financial Conduct  Authority. Instead  this service looks to resolve individual  complaints 
between a consumer  and a business. Should  we decide that something has gone wrong we 
ask the business to put things right by placing the consumer, as far as is possible, in the 
position they would have  been if the problem  hadnt occurred. I can understand why Mr W 
might feel let down by the tone of correspondence he received from CarCashPoint . But I am 
not going to make any award in relation to this. 
Ive considered Mr Ws additional comments and further information very carefully,  but on 
balance, they havent changed my view of his complaint.
Ref: DRN83574895As I havent  received any comments or new information  that changes  my mind  about this 
matter, I confirm my provisional conclusions.  I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint about the loan 
or about the charges that he had to pay in relation to the recovery  action that had been 
instructed. But I do think that CarCashPoint treated him unfairly when it continued  to apply 
late payment fees to his account  after it had instructed the recovery  action. So CarCashPoint  
should put things right.
Putting things  right
I think it would be fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this case  for CarCashPoint  to
refund to Mr W all late payment fees applied to his account after the date that recovery
action was instructed.
CarCashPoint should refund these  fees with 8% simple interest calculated  on all the late
payment fees charged (including  any fees already refunded) from the date the fees would
have arisen to the date the complaint is settled.
HM Revenue & Customs  requires CarCashPoint to deduct tax from this interest. 
CarCashPoint should give Mr W a certificate  showing  how much tax its deducted, if he asks
for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  this complaint and direct CarCashPoint Limited 
to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 June  2021.
