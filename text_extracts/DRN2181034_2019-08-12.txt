K820x#14complaint
Mr A and Mrs O are unhappy  that their mortgage  with National Westminster  Bank  Plc has 
been on its Standard Variable Rate (SVR) since their two-year fixed  rate product expired  in 
2010. They  want NatWest  to repay  what  they say is overcharged interest from 2010 until 
2018.
background
In 2008, on the advice  of a mortgage broker, Mr A and Mrs O took out a mortgage  with 
NatWest. It was an interest-only mortgage over a 25-year term, with the first two years on a 
fixed rate of interest  of 6.39%, expiring on 30 June 2010, following which  the mortgage 
reverted to NatWests SVR. The loan-to-value  (LTV) was 95%.  The mortgage remained on 
SVR until November 2018 when Mr C and Mrs A switched to a new product  a two-year 
fixed rate of 2.09% until 31 December 2020.
In November 2018 Mr A and Mrs O complained to NatWest about the mortgage. 
Mr A and Mrs O referred to the Bank  of England  Base  Rate (BEBR) which was 2.0% when 
they took out the mortgage in 2008, and showed how this had gone down to 0.5% in 2009,  
dropping to 0.25% in 2016  and how the rate had now moved  to 0.75%.. 
They compared this with the interest rate on their mortgage which  had stared at the fixed 
rate of 6.39% and which  then reverted  to a rate of 4.00% from 2010 until 2016, falling in 
3.75% in 2017 and then increasing  to 3.99% in 2018.
Mr A and Mrs O said theyd contacted  NatWest  in 2012 and 2016 to review the interest rate 
and to explore  the possibility of transferring onto capital and interest repayment. They say 
that they received no help from NatWest and that no options  were offered to them until 2018 
when they switched to a new product on an interest  rate of 2.09%.
Mr A and Mrs O say they have been  treated unfairly  and cheated by NatWest.  They  consider 
NatWest has exploited  more than enough  profit from them.  They are demanding that 
NatWest recalculates their mortgage as if it had been on an interest  rate of 2.09% from 
June 2012 onwards and to use the refund  they believe they are entitled to towards reducing 
the capital balance.
NatWest didnt uphold  the complaint. It said that, when  the original fixed rate expired in 2010 
NatWest spoke to Mr A and explained that it couldnt offer an interest rate lower  than SVR. 
There was no further contact until 2014 when  Mr A and Mrs Os NatWest branch enquired if 
there was any early repayment charge  (ERC)  on the mortgage  (there  was not).
NatWest says that in December 2014 Mr A called  to discuss  the interest rate and possibly 
transferring onto a capital  and interest repayment mortgage. NatWest  explained  that the 
mortgage allowed  for unlimited overpayments on SVR, and so rather than transfer onto 
capital and interest or a new product, the mortgage  remained  on SVR and interest-only.
NatWest acknowledged  that there may have  been  some confusion when Mr A and Mrs O 
discussed their mortgage in their local branch. The bank  explained  that the extent to which 
staff in branch  could  assist in varying a mortgage product was limited.  From  this Mr 
A and Mrs O might have thought that NatWest wasnt willing to help them.  But the bank also 
Ref: DRN21810342said that Mr A and Mrs O could have gone  through the Mortgage Services department  to 
apply for a new product if theyd wanted to.
As a result, NatWest didnt think it had done anything wrong.
Mr A and Mrs O brought their complaint to us. An adjudicator looked at what both parties 
had said. Having done so, he didnt think the complaint should be upheld.  Mr A and Mrs O 
asked for an ombudsman to review  the adjudicators findings. Theyve provided no further 
evidence or arguments.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not upholding this 
complaint.
Ive noted what  Mr A and Mrs O have said about BEBR. But NatWests  SVR isnt a tracker 
rate and so the bank isnt under any obligation to alter its SVR to reflect  fluctuations in 
BEBR.
I note that there were  discussions around available rates in 2010  and 2014.  But by staying  
on SVR they were able to make unlimited overpayments. Had they opted  for a new fixed 
rate, theyd have been limited to overpayments  of 10% of the outstanding balance during  the 
fixed rate period. Anything  over that would trigger an ERC.
The banks records dont  suggest that Mr A and Mrs O were told that they were  unable to 
apply for a new product. This was always an option available  to them.  But I think Mr 
A and Mrs O might have misunderstood  the position. I think  NatWest  was right if it dissuaded 
them from taking out a new product in 2010 and 2014.
Ive looked at the rates that were available in 2010.  NatWest wasnt offering a 95% LTV 
product. But its lowest  90% LTV product  in June 2010 was a 2-year  fixed rate at 6.19%  
which is 2.19% higher  than SVR. Given the property market in 2010 where prices had fallen 
since 2008, I think its unlikely the property was at 90% LTV in any event.
In 2014 NatWest had two-year  fixed rate at 5.19% for a 90% LTV. This is 1.19% higher than 
NatWests SVR in 2014.
Mr A says theyd wanted to go onto a capital repayment mortgage. But by staying on SVR 
on interest-only mortgage, Mr A and Mrs O could  have made unlimited overpayments  of 
capital each month. In other words, they could have treated  their interest-only mortgage as if 
theyd been on a capital repayment mortgage  and paid an extra  sum each month off the 
capital. Had they done that, Mr A and Mrs O would have had the benefit of not being tied into 
any product with an ERC. But Mr A and Mrs O havent made  any overpayments. I am 
assuming they have  continued to invest in the ISA which  I understand to be their repayment 
vehicle for the interest-only mortgage.
So Im satisfied that by staying on SVR Mr A and Mrs O were  not disadvantaged I dont think 
theyd have been able to take out a new product in 2010 or 2014 that would  have been  at a 
better interest rate than SVR. They would also have been tied into an ERC and lost the 
option to make unlimited  overpayments.
Ref: DRN21810343In all the circumstances, I dont think NatWest has treated  Mr A and Mrs O unfairly  in the 
way its handled  their mortgage account.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A and Mrs O to 
accept or reject my decision  before  12 September 2019.
