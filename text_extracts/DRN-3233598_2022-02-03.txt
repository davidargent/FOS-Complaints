The complaint
Mrs A says Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money (118 118) lent to her 
irresponsibly. This is because she didnt have enough disposable income to repay the 
lending and it caused her financial difficulty. She thinks the loan should be written off. 
What happened
This complaint is about one high cost loan 118 118 provided to Mrs A in September 2020. 
Mrs A borrowed £3,600 and she was due to make 12 monthly repayments of £404.48. Mrs A 
was unable to make the repayments relatively early on and she fell into arears. 
Our adjudicator upheld the complaint. He thought that the information that 118 118 had at 
the time of sale showed that Mrs A wasnt able to sustainably repay the loan. He 
recommended that 118 118 refund any interest Mrs A had paid so she would only repay the 
capital borrowed. He also recommended 118 118 remove any negative information from her 
credit file about this loan. 
118 118 agreed with what the adjudicator said and calculated the compensation. 
Mrs A, via her representative, disagreed with the compensation calculation. This was 
because when Mrs A had fallen behind with her repayments 118 118 offered to waive some 
of the arrears if she was able to make some repayments. The details of this are as follows: 
In November 2020 Mrs A was £813.78 in arears. 118 118 said that if she paid 
£406.89 it would reduce these arears to zero. 
In July 2021 Mrs A owed £1,050.48 in arears. 118 118 said that if she paid £525.24 it 
would reduce these arears to zero. 
Mrs A made these payments. I understand these are the only loan repayments made to 
date. 
Mrs A disagrees with the compensation as it only reduced the capital owed by the amounts 
she actually paid. Mrs A feels the remaining capital she owes should be reduced by the 
amounts she paid  plus the amounts 118 118 agreed to waive, as outlined above. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Its been agreed that 118 118 shouldnt have lent to Mrs A. I dont disagree with this outcome 
for the same reasons our adjudicator gave, I think 118 118 shouldnt have lent to Mrs A. 
So, the only disagreement left is whether the compensation the adjudicator recommended, 
and 118 118 has agreed to pay, is reasonable. 
Where a loan is mis-sold we try to put the consumer back in the position they would have 
been if the loan was not started. Its not always possible to do this entirely as the loan money 
has often been used and the customer has derived some benefit from it. 
But its fair that the interest the consumer has paid is returned to them because the interest 
shouldnt have been paid in the first place. And its also fair that the consumer repays any 
unpaid capital because this is the loan amount they received but wouldnt have if the 
business had not lent. The compensation the adjudicator recommended does this. 
I dont think its fair 118 118 increases the amount Mrs A has paid in the compensation by 
the amounts it was prepared to waive earlier. These were concessions to Mrs A whilst the 
loan was active. But if she had continued with the contract as normal going forward Ms A 
would still have paid interest on the amount she owed. 
So, the compensation puts her in a better position overall than she would be if she had 
continued with the loan.  And she didnt actually pay these increased amounts. So, I dont 
think the earlier waived amounts should form part of the redress. 
As our adjudicator said Mrs A will still have some amounts to repay after the compensation. I 
would remind 118 118 of its responsibility to treat Ms A fairly when arranging any 
repayments going forward.
Putting things right
118 118 has already calculated the compensation payable and I agree with its calculations. 
But for completeness the compensation payable is a as follows:
118 118 shouldnt have given Mrs A this loan.
A) 118 118 should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on this 
outstanding loan, and treat any repayments made by Mrs A as though they had been 
repayments of the principal. 
B) If this results in Mrs A having made overpayments then 118 118 should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 
C) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Mrs A.
D) if there is still an outstanding balance then 118 118 should try to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with Mrs A. 
E) 118 118 should remove any adverse information recorded on Mrs As credit file in 
relation to this loan. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 to deduct tax from this interest. 118 118 should 
give Mrs A a certificate showing how much tax 118 118 has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decisionFor the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mrs As complaint.
Madison CF UK Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 March 2022.
