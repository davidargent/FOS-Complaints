The complaint
Mr M complains that Capital One (Europe) plc (CapOne) defaulted his account.
What happened
Mr M had a credit card from CapOne. In April 2020 the balance was £1,531.35. Mr Ms 
income was affected by the pandemic and in April 2020, he contacted CapOne, who agreed 
a three-month payment holiday. In July 2020, he was still struggling and CapOne agreed to 
a further payment holiday for another three months. In November 2020, Mr M spoke to 
CapOne again as his employment still hadnt resumed and they agreed to a three month 
hardship plan on an interest-free basis and made a refund of interest of £208.44. The 
contractual minimum payment was around £15 per month  depending on the balance; but 
no payments were required during the hardship plan. In January 2021, Mr M said he would 
pay in £5 a month and these payments were made between then and May 2021  a total of 
£45 was paid in.
In April 2021, CapOne sent Mr M a Notice of Default with the arrears at £286.73. In May 
2021, CapOne sent a Statement of Default with the balance £1,495.13 and the account was 
defaulted. The default was registered with the credit reference agencies.
Mr M complained. He said the default was unfair. He said he wasnt advised by CapOne that 
they were going to default his account. And he was on a payment plan at the time. The 
default was now causing him great problems and depression. He said he produced medical 
evidence which CapOne ignored.
CapOne said theyd acted fairly. Mr M was on payment holidays between April 2020 and 
October 2020. And then, in November 2020 they put him on a three month hardship plan. In 
the letter confirming this, they advised Mr M that a default was possible. The default notice 
dated 14 April 2021 asked Mr M to pay arrears of £286.73  which he hadnt done. And so  
the default was registered in May 2021. CapOne said they had to record accurate 
information with credit reference agencies, and so advised them of the default.
Mr M brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said CapOne acted reasonably. In the 
calls between CapOne and Mr M, theyd advised him of the possibility of default, as did the 
letters they sent to him. And so  the default was added correctly. Theyd received and 
reviewed Mr Ms medical evidence in June 2021  and decided that the default shouldnt be 
removed. He could see that Mr M hadnt contacted CapOne between 5 January 2021 and 20 
May 2021. He acknowledged that Mr M was making payments of £5 a month  but this was 
below the minimum needed. 
Mr M didnt agree. He said everyone had been hit by the pandemic and it wasnt fair that 
CapOne defaulted his account. He asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that CapOne gave Mr M two payment holidays under the Covid-19 support 
measures, each for three months, starting in April 2020. So, he had payment holidays 
running from April 2020 through to October 2020. That was the right thing for CapOne to do 
 as Mr M worked in the hospitality industry and had suffered a big drop in income due to the 
pandemic. 
To be clear, in April 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced guidance to 
lenders in response to the effects on customers of the COVID-19 pandemic. All lenders, 
including CapOne, had to put in place payment holidays on many credit agreements, 
including credit cards  to help customers who were affected. Customers could ask for a 
total of two payment holidays each of three months  whereby payments could be 
suspended. Missed payments would not be reported to credit reference agencies, although 
interest would still be debited to the accounts. This support was provided by firms up to the 
end of October 2020. 
The intention was to provide short term support  usually in cases where customers would 
be returning to work within a short period of time. And so  where a customers situation was 
that they were in longer term difficulty, then payment holidays under this scheme werent 
normally agreed.
And so, in Mr Ms case  he had already had payment holidays up to the maximum allowed 
under the FCAs scheme when he called CapOne again in November 2020  so CapOne 
couldnt have given him another one. And by that time  Mr M was in deeper financial 
difficulty and wasnt sure when he might return to work. So, in those circumstances, CapOne 
did the most reasonable thing by giving him a hardship hold for three months when he 
called in November 2020. This meant that Mr M wasnt charged any interest or fees and 
didnt have to make any payments - but any missed payments would be reported to the 
credit reference agencies and arrears would still build up. The hardship hold was therefore 
different to the payment holiday scheme he had previously.
Mr M then called CapOne in January 2021 and said he would pay in £5 a month  which he 
did until May 2021. But CapOne then defaulted the account in May 2021  despite those 
payments being made. Even though Mr M was making the payments of £5, they were below 
the contractual minimum needed each month. 
The crux of Mr Ms complaint is  were CapOne clear enough in their communications with 
him in November 2020 and after that. I wanted to see if they were clear that arrears would 
be built up (when payments werent needed), and that Mr Ms account could be defaulted. 
Firstly, I reviewed the letters that CapOne sent to Mr M.
On 10 November 2020, CapOne wrote to Mr M to set out the terms of the hardship plan 
theyd agreed. The letter said No payments are required during this time. And as you wont 
be maintaining the minimum monthly payments we will report these missed payments 
(arrears) to the credit bureau.well contact you at the end of the arrangement to look at 
options availablewe may register a default on your credit file. And so  this letter did say 
that there was a possibility of a default in the future, at the end of the hardship plan. It also 
said that arrears would occur  though I have to say it wasnt very clear on that. I also looked 
at whether CapOne contacted Mr M at the end of the hardship plan  either by phone, text, 
or letter. But they didnt. Ideally, this should have happened.
Mr M then called CapOne in January 2021 and said he would pay in £5 each month  and I 
can see he did that. CapOne then sent Mr M a Notice of Default on 14 April 2021  which said 
he was in arrears by £286.73, and this needed to be paid by 12 May 2021. The letter says that if Mr M didnt pay the amount due, then We will terminate your account and issue you 
with a Statement of Defaultwe will notify the credit reference agencies that you have 
defaulted on your agreement. So  I think the letter was clear that a default may happen.
CapOne then sent a default letter to Mr M on 17 May 2021 which said, Your Capital One 
account is now officially in defaulta default will be registered with the credit reference 
agencies for six years.. So, I think the letter was clear and said a default would be notified 
to the credit reference agencies.
I then listened to the calls between Mr M and CapOne. On 29 September 2020  Mr M said 
he was still out of work and struggling. CapOnes call handler said a further payment holiday 
couldnt be agreed  but said a hardship plan was an option. She said this would involve no 
debit interest, but arrears would still be accumulated and the account may be defaulted  but 
CapOne would give notice of that in advance. She also said missed payment would be 
reported to the credit reference agencies. Mr M said he wanted to avoid a default if he could 
 and it was left that he would think about his options. So  at that stage, nothing had been 
agreed, but CapOnes call handler was clear about the arrears and potential for default.
On 8 November 2020, Mr M called again. He said he couldnt afford to make the payments 
to the card. CapOnes call handler offered the hardship plan for three months and said there 
would be no interest or fees; payments would not be needed. But arrears would accumulate 
and missed payments reported to the credit reference agencies. She said the account may 
default. So  I think the call hander was clear that arrears would build up and was also clear 
about the possibility of default.
And so  I think CapOnes communications were clear  in their letters and the calls. But 
also  I think that CapOne shouldve contacted Mr M at the end of the hardship plan but 
didnt.
Mr M has said that he sent medical evidence to CapOne, but they ignored it. I looked at what 
hed sent to CapOne and how they reviewed it. Mr M sent this to CapOne in June 2021  
after the default had happened, and so CapOne considered whether the default should be 
removed in the light of it and decided it shouldnt. And I think that was a reasonable decision 
by CapOne  as the medical evidence was sent to them two months after the Notice of 
Default  and I dont think its reasonable to expect CapOne to consider Mr Ms 
circumstances as presented to them after the event. 
I then considered whether the default of Mr Ms account should be removed. During our 
investigation, CapOne told us that the arrears quoted in the default notice dated 14 April 
2021 were overstated by £218  as theyd made an interest refund of that amount in error in 
November 2020 when they set up the hardship plan. So, I looked at that aspect. But after 
adjusting for this, the arrears in March 2021 were still £88.29  which was five months 
arrears. The guidance for dealing with defaults is laid down by the Information 
Commissioners Office (ICO). This says when a consumer is at least three months behind 
with their payments then a default may be registered. And it would expect a default to be 
registered by the time the consumer is six months behind with their payments. It is the 
business responsibility to put an entry on the credit file. This cannot be taken off unless it is 
an error. And so  CapOne acted within these guidelines.
I then looked at what happened after the default. I can see that Mr M didnt make any 
payments to the account from June 2021 up to June 2022  the balance then being 
£1,490.13. So  even if the default in May 2021 were to be deleted, its clear to me that Mr M 
wouldve been defaulted later anyway. And its in his interest to have the default registered 
as early as possible  because it remains on Mr Ms credit file for six years from that time.And so, while I know Mr M will find this disappointing, I think CapOne acted reasonably. And 
therefore, I wont be asking them to do anything here. 
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 August 2022.
