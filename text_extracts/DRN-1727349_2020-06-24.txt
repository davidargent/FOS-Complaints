Mr P said that he became dependent on the loans and was having to borrow more to make 
his repayments.
Sunny said that before all loans were provided it carried out eligibility, creditworthiness and 
affordability checks to ensure the amount borrowed could be repaid without undue 
difficulties. It did note that Mr P had been borrowing from it for an extended period and said 
that further checks could have taken place from when he had been borrowing for 18 months. 
Because of this it upheld his complaint in regard to loan 29 onwards. 
Our adjudicator upheld this complaint in regard to loans 12 to 39. He thought that by loan 12, 
Mr Ps pattern of borrowing showed he was persistently reliant on short term loans and that 
this pattern itself showed that this loan and subsequent loans were unsustainable.
Sunny didnt accept that there was a pattern from loan 12 that meant the loans shouldnt 
have been provided. It provided an alternative offer upholding the complaint from loan 22 
onwards (when Mr P had been borrowing for 12 months). 
Mr P didnt accept Sunnys offer.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We've set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr P could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and the 
consumer's income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr P could sustainably repay his loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having 
to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly 
and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments 
sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold loans 1 to 11. While the checks carried before the first four 
loans were provided were reasonable I think that further checks should have been carried 
out before loan 5 and subsequent loans were provided to ensure that the lending was 
sustainable. Mr P has provided copies of his bank statements but as the earliest of these is 
August 2017, I cannot say that further checks on the loans before this would have suggested 
the loans werent sustainably affordable.
Having looked through Mr Ps statements for August through to November 2017, these show 
that Mr P had made use of other short term loan providers, however I do not find that I have 
enough to say that this alone meant loans shouldnt have been provided at this time. I have 
also looked through the credit report Mr P provided and although this is from December 
2019 it provides information about the time of the early loans. However based on the 
additional information I have seen, and as the earlier loans appeared to be affordable, I do 
not find that I can say loans 1 to 11 shouldnt have been provided.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr P, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
12. By this time Mr P had been borrowing from Sunny for almost six months and while there 
were a couple of short breaks in the lending, he remained indebted to Sunny for the majority 
of this period. He was taking out new loans before repaying previous loans and when repayments were made he was taking out new loans shortly after. I think this should have 
raised concerns that Mr P wasnt able to repay his loans without borrowing again to fill the 
hole caused by the repayment.
Mr P had been borrowing for a number of months and his level of borrowing wasnt showing 
signs of a consistent reduction and so I think it reasonable that Sunny would have realised at 
this time that his borrow was not to meet a short term need but instead to meet his ongoing 
requirements. Mr P continued to borrow from Sunny showing his dependence on these loans 
continued. 
I think that Mr P lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 12 
onwards because these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time. The number of loans Mr P borrowed was also likely to have had negative implications 
on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
Putting things right
I am upholding this complaint in regard to loans 12 to 39 and require Sunny to take the 
following action:
Refund any interest and charges Mr P paid on loans 12 to 39 along with  simple
interest at a rate of 8% per annum from the date of payment to the date of
settlement*.
The overall pattern of Mr Ps borrowing from loan 12 means any information recorded
about them is adverse, so all entries about loans 12 to 30 should be removed from
Mr P's credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ps complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mr P compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2020.
