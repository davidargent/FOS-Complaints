The complaint
Mr H complains about the price of a mobile phone that he bought using a fixed sum loan 
agreement with Virgin Media Mobile Finance Limited.
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr H entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Virgin Media Mobile Finance that 
he electronically signed in August 2019 to pay for a mobile phone;
the agreement was interest free and the price of the phone was £828  but Mr H 
says that he became aware that the phone was available for £729 from other sources 
so he complained to Virgin Media Mobile Finance and then to this service;
the price of the phone is clearly set out in the agreement and Mr H agreed to make 
36 monthly payments of £23 to repay that amount;
the agreement says: By signing this Credit Agreement (including the terms and 
conditions) you agree to be bound by it; and; It is important that you have read and 
understood this Credit Agreement (including the terms and conditions set out below) 
before you sign this Credit agreement. If you are unsure or have any questions about 
any aspect of the Credit Agreement including the terms and conditions) please 
contact us or seek independent advice;
the price that Virgin Media Mobile Finance charged for the phone is a commercial 
decision for it to make  and this service wouldnt normally interfere with a business 
legitimate commercial decision;
Im not persuaded that theres any evidence to show that Virgin Media Mobile 
Finance gave incorrect information about the price of the phone to Mr H or that there 
was any requirement for it to charge less than £828 for it  so I dont consider that it 
would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to interfere with its 
commercial decision about the price of the phone;
Virgin Media Mobile Finance hasnt charged Mr H any interest under the agreement  
he agreed to pay £828 for the phone by making 36 monthly payments of £23  so I 
dont consider that it has misrepresented the interest rate to Mr H;
nor do I consider that theres enough evidence to show that it gave misleading 
information about the price of the phone or the interest rate to Mr H  the price of the 
phone was £828 and Mr H agreed to pay that price  if he hadnt wanted to so I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect him not to have signed the agreement;
Im not persuaded that that theres enough evidence to show that Virgin Media 
Mobile Finance has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr H; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Virgin Media Mobile Finance to reduce the price of the phone, to refund any of the 
payments that Mr H has made for it, to pay him any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2021.
