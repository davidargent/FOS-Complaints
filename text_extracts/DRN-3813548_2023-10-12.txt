The complaint
Mr and Mrs M complain that Vacation Finance Limited, trading as VFL Finance Solutions, 
wont refund to them the money that they paid to acquire some membership credits from a 
holiday company. Theyre being represented in their complaint by a claims management 
company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs M entered into a membership application agreement with a holiday company in 
May 2018 to buy 4,300 level 1 membership credits. The membership application fee was 
£9,600 and they made an advance payment of £2,880 by bank transfer. I understand that 
they entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Vacation Finance for a loan of £6,720 and 
that they agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £87.32 to Vacation Finance  but Ive 
not been provided with a copy of that agreement. 
Mr and Mrs Ms representative made claims, on behalf of Mr and Mrs M, to Vacation Finance 
under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in December 2020. It said 
that: the product and the loan agreement were mis-sold to Mr and Mrs M; the product was 
misrepresented to them; the contract was breached; commission was paid between 
Vacation Finance and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr and Mrs M which 
created a breach of fiduciary duty and an unfair relationship; the loan agreement was 
unaffordable; the holiday company and Vacation Finance had an unfair relationship and the 
loan agreement wasnt in Mr and Mrs Ms best interest; and the holiday company had filed 
for liquidation.
Vacation Finance didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so Mr and Mrs M 
complained to this service. Their complaint form says that: the holiday company and 
Vacation Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan; 
Vacation Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to them 
and the holiday company unduly pressured them into entering into the membership 
application agreement and the loan agreement; all rendering the loan agreement unfair 
pursuant to section 140A. Vacation Finance then provided this service with a detailed 
explanation as to why it didnt consider that Mr and Mrs Ms claims should be upheld. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Ms complaint should be upheld. She 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think 
that the holiday company had breached the membership application agreement. She said 
that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr and Mrs M and 
Vacation Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the 
conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She also said that she hadnt seen anything 
persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs M.
Mr and Mrs Ms representative, on behalf of Mr and Mrs M, says that it doesnt agree with 
our investigators recommendation and has asked for this complaint to be referred to an 
ombudsman. It says that an unregulated credit intermediary was used by Vacation Finance 
and it is of the view that the loan agreement is unenforceable. It has also raised concerns 
about the way that the finance was sold to Mr and Mrs M and has referred to a decision 
issued by this service on a complaint relating to a different type of holiday ownership product 
in which it says that the voluminous documentation for the product was reviewed and the 
debtor-creditor relationship was considered to be unfair. It says that the same voluminous 
documents and the same unfair charges exist in the product that was sold to Mr and Mrs M 
so their relationship with Vacation Finance is unfair.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Ms complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
Mr and Mrs M signed the membership application agreement in May 2018 to buy 
4,300 level 1 membership credits from the holiday company - they also signed other 
documents including the holiday companys terms and conditions and a separate 
standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given to withdraw from the 
agreement  I consider it to be likely that they would have signed other documents at 
that time (including a loan agreement with Vacation Finance) but Ive not been 
provided with copies of those agreements;
Mr and Mrs Ms representative made claims to Vacation Finance in December 2020 
and Mr and Mrs M then made a complaint to this service  the claim letter referred to 
claims under sections 75 and 140A, including that the membership credits were 
misrepresented to Mr and Mrs M, but their complaint form only referred to claims 
under section 140A and didnt refer to a misrepresentation made by the holiday 
company;
the claim letter said that a comprehensive witness statement from Mr and Mrs M was 
enclosed but Vacation Finance says that a witness statement wasnt enclosed with 
the letter that it received and Ive not been provided with a copy of Mr and Mrs Ms 
witness statement;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Ms claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Vacation Finances response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
the claim letter said that Mr and Mrs M were advised that the package would enable 
them to have exclusive accommodation and cheaper holidays and that, over the 
length of the contract, they would save an amount in excess of the sum paid  it also 
said that they were advised that the product was of some substance, but its clear 
that the product is worthless and has no merit, and it was represented to them that 
the purchase would be an investment, the product would increase in value and, after 
a period of a few years, they would be able to sell it at a considerable profit;none of Mr and Mrs M and their representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to them;
one of our investigators requested Mr and Mrs Ms representative to ask Mr and 
Mrs M to describe in their own words how the credits were sold to them, how they 
thought it was an investment and to explain how they thought they would make 
money from it and to provide other specified information  their representative said 
that Mr and Mrs M had been asked to provide that information but were struggling to 
obtain it;
Mr and Mrs M had bought 4,300 level 1 membership credits and the terms and 
conditions that they signed say: The Credits purchased grant me the right of 
occupation or use of a Unit in each Use Year until the Termination Date or 
accelerated occupation and use in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined 
in the Standard information Document;
Ive not been provided with the standard information document but Ive seen no 
evidence to support Mr and Mrs Ms claim that the holiday company misrepresented 
to them that the membership credits would enable them to have exclusive 
accommodation and cheaper holidays and that, over the length of the contract, they 
would save an amount in excess of the sum paid;
the credits can be exchanged for the use of holiday accommodation so I consider 
that they do have some value and substance and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the holiday company represented to Mr and Mrs M 
that the credits would be an investment;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the credits were mis-
sold or misrepresented to Mr and Mrs M by the holiday company or that they were 
induced into entering into the membership application agreement by any such 
misrepresentations;
the claim letter also says that the holiday company has ceased to trade so has 
committed a repudiatory breach of contract  but Vacation Finance says that the 
holiday club is now operated by a newly appointed club manager and full use of the 
membership credits remains available to Mr and Mrs M;
I consider that the liquidation of the holiday company might be a breach of contract 
for which Vacation Finance could be liable under section 75 - but I consider the 
appointment of the new club manager company to have been a suitable remedy for 
any breach of contract, Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Ms use of 
their membership credits has been adversely impacted by the liquidation of the 
holiday company and Im not persuaded that Mr and Mrs M would be entitled to 
terminate the membership application agreement in these circumstances;
Ive seen no evidence to show that theres been any other breach of contract relating 
to the membership credits for which Vacation Finance would be liable under section 
75;
Mr and Mrs Ms representative says that commission was paid between Vacation 
Finance and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr and Mrs M which 
created a breach of fiduciary duty and an unfair relationship but Vacation Finance 
says that no commission was paid to the holiday company;
Ive not been provided with any other evidence to show that Vacation Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company and Im not persuaded that theres been a 
breach of any fiduciary duty in these circumstances; 
Mr and Mrs Ms representative says that the loan agreement was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs M and their complaint form says that the holiday company and Vacation 
Finance failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan  but 
none of Mr and Mrs M and their representative has provided detailed evidence about 
Mr and Mrs Ms financial position in May 2018 or to show that a loan of £6,720 with a 
monthly payment of £87.32 wasnt affordable for them at that time;
Vacation Finance says that its usual process involved obtaining income and 
expenditure information from the prospective debtor as well as conducting credit 
reference checks with external credit reference agencies and that Mr and Mrs M 
advised in their loan application form that they had a combined annual income of 
£52,400 which exceeded its minimum credit score requirement and they had a 
calculated monthly disposable amount of £736 so the monthly payment of £87.32 
was deemed affordable;
it also said in July 2021 that Mr and Mrs M had maintained their monthly loan 
payments and Im not persuaded that enough evidence has been provided to show 
that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr and Mrs M when it was made to them in May 
2018 or that the loan was mis-sold to them;
Mr and Mrs Ms complaint form says that the holiday company unduly pressured Mr 
and Mrs M into entering into the membership application agreement and the loan 
agreement  but Mr and Mrs M had signed the holiday companys separate standard 
form of the withdrawal notice that could be given to withdraw from the membership 
application agreement within 14 calendar days without giving any reason;
if they were concerned about the way that the membership credits had been sold to 
them and didnt want to buy them, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
them to have contacted either the holiday company or Vacation Finance within the 
withdrawal period to withdraw from the membership application agreement  but Ive 
seen no evidence to show that they did so;
Vacation Finance says that Mr and Mrs M bought a holiday club membership in 
August 2016 and it described their purchase and usage history since then, including 
that during their holiday at the resort in May 2018 they attended a sales meeting at 
which they traded in their one week of annual holiday entitlement towards the 
purchase of the membership credits;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs M were 
unduly pressured into entering into the membership application agreement and the 
loan agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptable sales practices 
against them;
Mr and Mrs Ms representative has referred to a decision issued by this service on a 
complaint relating to a different type of holiday ownership product in which it says the 
voluminous documentation for the product was reviewed and the debtor-creditor 
relationship was considered to be unfair  it says that the same voluminous 
documents and the same unfair charges exist in the product that was sold to Mr and 
Mrs M so their relationship with Vacation Finance is unfair;
that decision related to a different type of holiday ownership product which was sold 
as an investment and related to a specified property  Mr and Mrs M bought 
membership credits from the holiday company which didnt relate to a specified 
property and Im not persuaded that they were sold to them as an investment;
both types of products were often sold in similar ways and may have had similar 
contractual documentation but the operation and effect of the contractual 
documentation would be significantly different between the products;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr and Mrs M and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents or the charges created an unfair relationship between Mr and 
Mrs M and Vacation Finance;
Mr and Mrs Ms representative said in response to our investigators recommendation 
that an unregulated credit intermediary was used by Vacation Finance but that didnt 
form part of the claim that was made to Vacation Finance or the complaint that was 
made to this service so I cant make any finding on that issue in this decision  but 
Im not persuaded that Mr and Mrs Ms representative has provided enough evidence 
to show that that an unregulated credit intermediary was used or that the loan 
agreement would be unenforceable;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Ms 
relationship with Vacation Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs M 
and Vacation Finance in these circumstances;
Vacation Finance didnt issue a substantive response to Mr and Mrs Ms claims so I 
cant say that its response to their claims was fair and reasonable  but it then 
provided this service with a detailed response to those claims and I consider that the 
reasons that it gave for not upholding Mr and Mrs Ms claims were fair and 
reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs M for the issues that theyve had with their membership 
credits but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me 
to require Vacation Finance to refund to them any of the money that theyve paid for 
those credits, to cancel their loan agreement, to pay them any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ms complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs M to 
accept or reject my decision before 9 November 2023.
