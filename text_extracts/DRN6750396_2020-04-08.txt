K822xcomplaint
Mr G complains that NewDay  Ltd refused to refund transactions made online using his credit  
card, which he says he didnt authorise.
background 
Mr G says that a number of payments, totalling  just over £200,  to two different merchants, 
were taken from his credit  card account  without his authority. He was charged cash advance  
and other  fees and interest on these payments. NewDay decided to hold Mr G liable for the 
payments.
NewDay said that Mr G had accepted that he had made one payment to each of the 
merchants for £2.50 and £10 but he didnt  authorise  subsequent payments to be taken.  It 
asked him to provide further  information  about the payments but Mr G didnt do this. But 
NewDay also accepts that when he told them about  the matter it didnt immediately stop any 
further payments  from being taken.
As NewDay accepts that it made a mistake  it has now offered to refund the account with the 
amount of all the disputed  transactions, to pay interest on the amount it refunds, and also 
pay Mr G £100 as a gesture of goodwill.
Our adjudicator felt that NewDays  offer was fair and reasonable.
Mr G didnt respond so the complaint has been  passed to me to decide. This is the last stage 
of our process. If Mr G accepts my decision it is legally  binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr G disputed six payments, totalling  around  £211.54, made using his credit  card to two 
different merchants. NewDay sent Mr G some  forms to complete so that it could dispute 
these transactions  with the relevant merchants. But as Mr G didnt provide the information 
NewDay closed the dispute. 
Mr G stopped making payments to his credit  card account and his account fell into arrears. 
Mr G complained to NewDay but it told him that it was holding him liable for the payments.
After Mr G brought his complaint to this service, NewDay  accepted that it should have done 
more to help him. It allowed two payments  totalling  almost £140 to debit  his account after he 
had told it that he didnt make the payments. NewDay has now offered to refund £224.49,  
which is all the payments made to these merchants including the two Mr G accepted he 
made himself. It will also pay simple  interest of 8% on the amount refunded.  These amounts 
will be credited to Mr Gs account. It has also offered to pay Mr G £100 for the upset and 
inconvenience this has caused him. I consider this to be fair and reasonable.
Mr Gs account fell into arrears after he stopped  making repayments.  A default has been 
registered against him on his credit file. As there are other  transactions on Mr Gs account 
that havent been disputed Mr G was required, under the terms and conditions of his 
account, to maintain his repayments.  He decided not to do this.
Ref: DRN67503962NewDay is required to record the factual information  about  the conduct  of the account with 
the credit  reference  agencies. Im not persuaded that NewDay  made  a mistake in recording 
a default so it wouldnt be appropriate  for me to require it to amend Mr Gs credit file.
If an outstanding  balance remains after NewDay has made the refunds and added interest 
then I would urge Mr G to contact it so they can mutually agree a repayment plan.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I require NewDay  Ltd to:
1.Refund a total of £224.49 to Mr Gs account
2.Pay simple interest  at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these  amounts  that form this 
total from the date they were paid to the date of settlement
3.Pay (not credit) Mr G £100
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 May 2020.
