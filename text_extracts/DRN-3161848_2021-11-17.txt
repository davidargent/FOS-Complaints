The complaint
Ms V complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) declined a dispute she 
raised after an item she purchased wasnt received. 
  
What happened
On 14 October 2020 Ms V used her PayPal account to make a payment of £47.99 to a 
retailer. Ms V has explained that despite assurances from the retailer, her item was never 
delivered. 
Ms V raised a dispute with PayPal in an attempt to get her money back. PayPal contacted 
the retailer who provided a delivery reference. When input online, the delivery reference 
showed an item was delivered to a property in the same town Ms V lives in on 19 November 
2020. PayPal declined Ms Vs dispute on the basis the item was delivered. 
Ms V was told she could appeal by obtaining evidence from the courier to show where the 
item was delivered. Ms V was able to get evidence of the specific address that the delivery 
reference related to from the courier, but it wasnt her property. Ms V asked PayPal to 
change its decision to decline her dispute on the basis shed supplied evidence to show no 
delivery was made to her but it refused. 
Ms V complained but PayPal didnt agree any errors had been made. Ms V referred her 
complaint to this service and an investigator upheld it, asking PayPal to refund the payment 
in question and pay her £50 for the distress and inconvenience caused. PayPal asked to 
appeal, but no information about why it didnt accept the investigators view was given. As 
PayPal asked to appeal, Ms Vs case has been passed to me to make a decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive read the relevant sections of PayPals user agreement. I understand for it to be satisfied 
an item was correctly delivered PayPal will accept delivery notification that provides the town 
and county as confirmation without details of the exact address. But this service decides 
complaints on a fair and reasonable basis. So whilst Ive taken the terms of the user 
agreement into account, I need to be satisfied PayPal treated Ms V fairly when it declined 
her dispute. 
Ms V has obtained independent evidence from the courier that shows the delivery 
notification the retailer provided doesnt relate to her address. It shows an item was delivered 
to a completely different address, albeit in the same town as Ms V. Given we have evidence 
that specifically shows the delivery notification the retailer has provided relates to another 
delivery, I dont agree its fair for PayPal to rely on that as a reason to decline Ms Vs 
dispute. 
Im satisfied the evidence provided doesnt show a successful delivery was made to Ms V. 
On that basis, I dont agree its fair for PayPal to decline Ms Vs dispute. As a result, Im 
going to tell PayPal to refund the disputed £47.99 payment. 
Its clear the situation has caused Ms V some inconvenience and I agree with the 
investigator that £50 is a fair way to compensate her for whats happened. So Im also going 
to tell PayPal to pay Ms V £50 for the distress and inconvenience caused by the way it 
handled her dispute. 
  
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to 
refund the £47.99 disputed payment and pay Ms V £50 for the distress and inconvenience 
caused.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms V to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2021.
