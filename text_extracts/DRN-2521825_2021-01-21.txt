The complaint

Mr Lender. He describes that he was stuck in a loop of taking loans to pay loans.

One of our adjudicators looked at this complaint and thought that Mr Lender should put
things right for Mr D in relation to Loans 3 and 4. He did not think it needed to do anything for
Loans 1, 2, 5 and 6. Mr Lender objected and Mr D has not made any comment.
Mr Lender had already sent to us the loan agreements, a brief summary of the information
Mr D had given to it when he had applied for each loan, and the additional information it had
asked Mr D about. It had sent the credit search result summaries Mr Lender had acquired
before approving each loan. I asked Mr D for additional evidence for Loans 3 and 4 and he
sent to me his bank statements for the period August 2016 to June 2017.
The complaint remained unresolved and so it was passed to me to decide. I issued a 
provisional decision on 6 January 2021 in which I indicated that I was planning not to uphold 
Mr Ds complaint. 
Since then, Mr Lender has agreed with my provisional decision. We have only received a 
query about an email from Mr D and nothing further. Our adjudicator tried to call Mr D to 
check what this meant but he was not able to make contact. 
The reply date for both parties to send me anything further to take into account was 
20 January 2021. So, I am issuing my final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand
whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a sustainable manner
without it adversely impacting on their financial situation.
A lender should gather enough information for it to be able to make an informed decision on
the lending. Although the guidance and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks,
they did list several things a lender could take into account before agreeing to lend. The key
element was that any checks needed to be proportionate and had to take into account a
number of different things, including how much was being lent and when the sum being
borrowed was due to be repaid.
There is a break in the lending between Loans 4 and 5 and I think that it is long enough for
Mr Lender to reasonably treat Mr D as a new customer in May 2018. I have considered that
there is a period of non-lending between Loans 3 and 4, but by the time Mr D had paid off
Loan 3 in November 2016 he had been Mr Lenders customer for about 14 months. And so,
my view is that the break of over five months was not a long enough period for me to treat
Loan 4 as the start of a new lending chain.
Mr D has not disagreed with the adjudicators opinion in relation to Loans 1, 2, 5 and 6 and 
so it appeared that these were not in dispute. Mr Lender asked for the review of the 
complaint by an ombudsman and so I have focussed on Loans 3 and 4 which are the loans
Mr Lender says he could afford. Mr Lender thought that Mr D would have even been able to
repay all his monthly outgoings again and still have funds available to him.
Mr Lender has said that Mr D had informed it that he was living at home with his parents
throughout his application history. That seems to have been reflected in the information he
gave to Mr Lender as he had not declared any rent or utility bill expenditure. His income was
given as £1,300 each month. He had declared that he was spending money each month on
food/travel £100, telecommunications £150, Council Tax £82 and Loans of £50. That would
have left Mr D with a surplus of £918.
Mr Lender had calculated that: The highest amount repayable on this loan would have been
£442.00 and this would have been against a disposable income of £918.00. This is just 48 %
of the disposable income and just 34 % of the net income of £1,300.00. These figures are
what led the adjudicator to come to the opinion he did  that Loans 3 and 4 ought not to
have been approved for Mr D. Our adjudicator said: The repayment for loan 3 represented a
significant proportion of Mr Ds income. In these circumstances, there was a significant risk
that Mr D wouldnt have been able to meet their existing commitments without having to
borrow again.
I have asked for and reviewed additional information to give me some background to Mr Ds
financial situation around the time of Loans 3 and 4. And this was because I think that by
Loan 3, where Mr D had applied again for a loan which was more than double his previous
loan, Mr Lender ought to have delved more deeply into his finances.
Having reviewed Mr Ds bank statements for the period leading up to Loans 3 and Loan 4
then I do not think that Mr D was in a situation where he was borrowing to repay borrowing.
Mr D had very few regular bills such as TV, utilities, rent, insurances or food. He spent a lot 
of money  sometimes around £350 a month on telephone bills. Those appear to be 
discretionary spending and not credit commitments. He did have Direct Debits to a 
telephone company which look to have been credit commitments but these were separate tothe bills. 
Mr D did have other lending but Mr Lender appeared to have known about them they were 
relatively modest sums and never more than two other loans. There were periods when Mr D 
had no other loans apart from one with Mr Lender.
I think that Mr Ds income would have covered his regular expenditure (which appears to
have been low), other loans and regular credit commitments as well as the Mr Lender loans.
So, I am not satisfied that Mr D was unable to repay the loans taken with Mr Lender and
I have decided not to uphold his complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Ds complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 February 2021.
