The complaint
Mr T complains about how PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA dealt with his claim that items he 
bought were not as described and that items were missing.
What happened
Mr T bought an item via an online site for £1,198 through PayPal. He says the item was 
faulty and there were missing parts and so contacted PayPal as he believed the purchase 
was covered by what is known as buyer protection. He says PayPal asked him to report 
what had happened to the Police which he did and was told he needed to also make a report 
to Action Fraud. Mr T says he gave PayPal the Police reference, but Action Fraud said it 
wouldnt provide a letter. He says he told PayPal that and sent it a screen shot to provide 
evidence that he had made a report to it. Mr T says he spoke to PayPal and it said it would 
re-open his claim when it received the letter from Action Fraud. He says he did get a letter 
from Action Fraud, but PayPal refused to re-open his claim. Mr T would like just under 
£5,000 compensation and says he has taken time off work to try and resolve this complaint 
and has been caused stress.
PayPal says its not made a mistake and was entitled to tell Mr T to make a complaint to the 
Police when he said there were missing parts. It says it didnt receive the letter from Action 
Fraud in time and so correctly declined Mr Ts claim. PayPal says its acted in line with 
agreed terms and conditions and says it gave Mr T longer than it said it would to provide the 
evidence.
Mr T had brought his complaint to us and our investigator upheld it. The investigator thought 
Mr T had given PayPal all the information it asked for and that PayPal said it would re-open 
the complaint. The investigator didnt think there was need to report the events to the Police 
and didnt think it would provide a report. The investigator thought overall PayPal had made 
it unnecessarily difficult for Mr T to proceed with his complaint and thought it likely it would 
have succeeded. He recommended PayPal re-open the complaint and refund Mr T the cost 
of the product and also pay him £200 compensation.
PayPal doesnt accept that view and says Mr T told it items were stolen and so it was not 
unreasonable to ask him to report that to the Police. It says it doesnt accept screen shots 
and says it has received letters and reports from Action Fraud in other cases and has 
provided a sample of that type of letter.
Mr T accepts the investigators view.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the overall view that PayPal hasnt dealt fairly with this 
complaint.
I appreciate that PayPal says Mr T said there were stolen items. But I cant see any record of 
that on the e-mail exchange between Mr T and PayPal. I can see that Mr T said the item was 
not as described, faulty and there were some items missing. In those circumstances Im 
satisfied this ought to have been dealt with by PayPal as goods significantly not as 
described and the usual evidence sought from both parties. I dont think it was reasonable 
to direct Mr T to the Police and Action Fraud and think it highly unlikely that the Police would 
have investigated what took place or provided a report. In any event I think Mr T did spend 
some time reporting the complaint to both the Police and Action Fraud and Im satisfied he 
provided evidence of that to PayPal.
I accept its up to PayPal to decide in which form it accepts evidence, but I have made clear I 
think the request to report matters to both the Police and Action Fraud was unnecessary and 
unreasonable. I also think Mr T did provide what evidence he could and says he was told by 
PayPal that it would re-open the complaint when it received the Action Fraud letter. PayPal 
hasnt disputed that it told Mr T that and it hasnt provided a copy of the call recording. In 
those circumstances I have no reason to doubt what Mr T says and think he was misled by 
PayPal about re-opening the complaint.
I dont know why PayPal couldnt have continued with the complaint without the Action Fraud 
letter in any event as the main part of Mr Ts complaint was about faulty goods.
Overall, Im satisfied that Mr T has provided the evidence PayPal wanted and hes not 
responsible for the actions of other bodies such as the Police or Action Fraud. I dont think it 
matters that PayPal has received such letters in the past and I have made clear that I cant 
see any reason why this complaint couldnt be investigated as a dispute over faulty goods. I 
agree with investigator that PayPal has placed unnecessary and unreasonable barriers to 
looking into this complaint and there is no reason to think that Mr Ts complaint wouldnt 
have been successful.
I intend to order PayPal to re-open the complaint and refund Mr T the money he paid. It is up 
to PayPal if it decides to re-open the complaint about the faulty goods in the light of the delay 
and the difficulties that delay may cause. I appreciate Mr T would like compensation for his 
loss of earnings. But Im satisfied the investigator has fairly explained how we approach such 
matters and so I think PayPal should pay the £200 compensation recommended. I think that 
award is fair and reasonable and takes into account the level of stress and inconvenience Mr 
T was caused and for the delay PayPal took in responding to his complaint. I make it clear to 
Mr T that if PayPal decide to reopen the complaint about the faulty goods then he may not 
be successful in retaining the cost of those goods depending on the outcome.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to 
refund Mr T the value of the purchase of £1,198 and re-open the original claim if it thinks that 
is appropriate and pay him £200 compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 October 2020.
