The complaint 
Mr I complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent irresponsibly 
to him. 
Background 
Between July 2015 and April 2016, Mr I borrowed 26 loans from Sunny. His borrowing 
history is set out in full in the appendix to this decision. I understand there is an outstanding 
balance in respect of loans 22, 23 and 26 and those debts have been sold to a third party. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny should have agreed to lend Mr I loans 8 to 26 because 
the overall pattern of borrowing was harmful. Although Sunny disagreed with that view, it 
offered to settle the matter by upholding the complaint in respect of loans 19 to 26. It later 
revised that offer to include loans 14 to 26. Mr I did not accept either offer.  
As the parties are not in agreement with our adjudicator, the matter has been passed to me 
to make a final decision. 
My findings 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr I could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr I could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Is complaint.
Neither party disagreed with what our adjudicator said about loans 1 to 8. Just for 
completeness, as I said above, early in the lending relationship, I think Sunny was entitled to 
rely on the information Mr I provided to it. So for the first four loans, I think the repayments 
would have appeared to be sustainably affordable. I think Sunny could have possibly asked 
more questions when Mr I applied for loans 5 to 7. But the evidence before me doesnt 
suggest Sunnys decision to lend should have been different even if those further enquiries 
had been made. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of the lending history with a view to seeing if there was 
a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. If that was the case, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Is case, I agree with our adjudicator that this point 
was reached by loan 8. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr I was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. He had taken out 8 loans within two months.  Sunny ought to have 
realised it was most likely he was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying 
his previous loans were leaving in his finances and that Mr Is indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr I was regularly provided with a new loan within a very short time of settling a 
previous loan. At this point Sunny ought to have known that Mr I was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need.
Mr I wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed. Loan 26 was taken out 
less than 9 months after his first. It was for a larger amount and Mr I also had two 
other loans outstanding for Â£900. Mr I had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, 
service a debt to Sunny over an extended period. 
 
I think that Mr I lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans Mr I borrowed was likely to have had negative implications on 
his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-
cost loans.
 
So Im also upholding the complaint about loans 8 to 26 and Sunny must put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr I loans 8 to 26. If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts, it 
must buy them back if it is able to do so. If it is not able to buy the debts back, it must liaise 
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below: 
a. Sunny must add together the total of the repayments made by Mr I towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything that has already been refunded; b. Sunny must calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr I 
which were considered as part of paragraph (a) from the date Mr I originally made 
the payments to the date the complaint is settled; 
c. Sunny must remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr I as though they had been 
repayments of principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr I having made 
overpayments, Sunny should refund these overpayments with 8%* simple interest 
calculated on the overpayments from the date the overpayments would have arisen 
to the date the complaint is settled. It must then refund the amounts calculated in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) and move to step (e); 
d. If there is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts calculated in (a) and (b) 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on the outstanding loans. If this 
results in a surplus, then the surplus must be repaid to Mr I. However, if there is still 
an outstanding balance, Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with 
Mr I. It must not pursue outstanding balances made up of principal it has already 
written off;
e. The overall pattern of Mr Is borrowing for loans 8 to 26 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. Sunny must remove these loans entirely from Mr Is 
credit file. It does not have to remove loans 22, 23 and 26 from the credit file until 
they have been paid. But it must remove any adverse information recorded about 
them. 
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr I a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partly upholding Mr Is complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited must put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 June 2020.
