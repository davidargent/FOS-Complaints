The complaint
Mr L complains that NewDay Ltd delayed in recording a default on his credit file.
What happened
Mr L told us that he was taken very seriously ill in 2018. He told NewDay about this in early 
August 2018. But he said that it had only applied a default for his card debt in late 2019. 
Mr B said that it was clear from the outset that his difficulties were going to be long-term in 
nature. So he thought the default shouldve been registered on his credit file between three 
and six months after he set up a token payment arrangement with a debt management 
agency. Or alternatively it shouldve been registered within 28 days of the date that NewDay 
had issued a notice of default. But he said NewDay didnt do either of those things. Instead, 
NewDay waited 14 months to register the default. 
NewDay said that it had recorded a default on Mr Ls credit file on 31 October 2019. Mr L 
had asked it to backdate this default, and NewDay had refused. 
NewDay said Mr Ls account was suspended around August 2018. NewDay asked Mr L for 
evidence of his medical situation then. But Mr L didnt send that, so in January 2019 the hold 
on his account was removed. Mr L spoke to NewDay not long after that, and complained 
about how his account was being managed. That complaint was upheld, and NewDay 
offered Mr L £150. Around that time, NewDay told Mr L that it wouldnt record a default on 
his credit file for the foreseeable future, if at all. 
But on 9 February 2019 NewDay wrote to Mr L to say it was intending to record a default on 
his credit file. Mr L complained again. 
NewDay accepted that Mr L had been incorrectly informed by the previous complaints officer 
that a default would not be recorded on his credit file. Because of this, NewDay said it would 
prevent a default from being applied to Mr Ls credit file for at least 6 months. NewDay said 
in mid-February 2019 Mr L agreed to that, and accepted £200 in compensation. Mr L 
continued to make his token payments. 
NewDay said it recorded a default on Mr Ls credit file after this six-month period was up, on 
31 October 2019. It didnt think it had been unreasonable in doing that. It said this was in line 
with the expectations set in February 2019. So it wouldnt backdate the default. 
NewDay said it doesnt usually suppress defaults. This was a one-off action that took place 
because it was what Mr L had been told would happen. NewDay said it had intended to give 
Mr L peace of mind, albeit for a short period of time. So it said it was very surprised that Mr L 
had brought a complaint now, to say it should have recorded the default earlier that October
2019.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. She said Mr L stopped making his 
contractual card payments in September 2018. NewDay issued a default notice on 
27 October 2018, and in early December NewDay wrote to say that it had taken the decision 
to cancel his credit card. Our investigator said that as a default letter had previously been 
issued, and NewDay had cancelled the credit card, she would have expected a default to 
have been registered around then, rather than about a year later.
Our investigator said that Mr L was aware that NewDay might issue a default in future, but 
she said it was understandable why he was unhappy that this was not backdated to when he 
first experienced financial difficulties. She thought that it was clear in August 2018 that he
was suffering from serious health issues and she also thought NewDay knew then that these 
would probably be long term. 
Our investigator understood NewDay had put the account on hold, but she didnt think 
delaying the default was beneficial to Mr L, as he was still in the same financial
position a year after informing NewDay of his condition.
Our investigator thought NewDay should backdate the default to 17 November 2018 and pay 
Mr L £100 compensation for the trouble and upset this has caused.
NewDay didnt agree. It said that the notice it issued in October 2018 asked Mr L to pay off 
his debt by 17 November, but it didnt tell him a default would be registered on his file if he 
didnt do that. It later delayed the recording of a default for six months, with the intention of 
assisting Mr L during a challenging time. It had only recorded a default after this period. And 
it repeated that it was surprised Mr L was challenging this now. 
NewDay wanted this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. 
Mr L asked why NewDay hadnt agreed, and our investigator told him what NewDay had 
said to our service. Mr L then wrote to set out his view of the previous discussions between 
him and NewDay. He took a less positive view of this than NewDay.
This case was then passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
Mr L became seriously ill in summer 2018. I think it was clear, from the conditions he 
described at that time, that this was likely to be a long-term problem. I also think that 
NewDay shouldve realised this then.
I think NewDay had a choice at the time. 
It could default Mr Ls debt quickly. Thats usually the best step to take, if someones likely to 
be unable to meet their contractual payments for a long time. 
Or it could wait and see if he recovered. As Ive said, I think that the medical conditions Mr L 
has told us about meant that a quick recovery was unlikely. I know that there was a delay in 
providing medical evidence in this case, but I dont think NewDay required that in order to 
default this account. So if NewDay was planning to default this account, I would have 
expected it to do so three months after Mr L stopped making his contractual payment, which 
would be November 2018. It appears as if NewDay had indicated to Mr L early in 2019 that it was unlikely to default this 
debt. That suggests there may have been some confusion at NewDay about whether it was 
going to default the account at all. NewDay now says this was said by mistake.
Because NewDay had given Mr L some incorrect information, it paused the registration of 
any default for six months. Whilst this may have been intended to assist Mr L, I dont think it 
did so. It just means Mr Ls credit file will carry this default for six months longer. Mr L is 
naturally looking forward, to his recovery, and hes concerned about how long this default will 
stay on his credit file.
I know its not always clear if someones going to be unwell for a long time, and so not able 
to resume payments in time to avoid a default. Sometimes, giving someone a little longer to 
get back on their feet is the best thing to do. But I dont think that was the right choice in this 
case. Its clear now that Mr Ls recovery is taking longer, but Ive also said I think Mr L was 
always likely to be unwell for a while. So I agree with our investigator, that NewDay 
shouldve defaulted this account in November 2018. For that reason, I think it should amend 
the default date for this account now, to 17 November 2018. 
I also agree with our investigator that this matter has caused Mr L trouble and upset, so I 
also think that NewDay should pay Mr L £100 compensation to make up for that.
My final decision
My final decision is that NewDay Ltd should amend the default date for Mr Ls account to 17 
November 2018, and pay Mr L £100 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 December 2020.
