K820x#14complaint
Mr L complains  that National Westminster Bank Plc refused to provide him with his 16 digit 
permanent account  number (PAN) over the telephone after his debit card was stolen. Hes 
also unhappy with the customer service he received.
background
While Mr L was abroad his NatWest debit card was stolen. On 19 March 2019, he contacted 
NatWest to ask it for the 16 digit permanent account  number (PAN) from the front of his 
stolen debit card. He wanted this to enable him to book  a flight  home. But NatWest told him 
it couldnt provide  that information  even  though  he had passed  security. 
There were a number of discussions in March 2019  between Mr L, his mother and NatWest. 
During those conversations representatives explained how Mr L could access cash while 
abroad without his debit card. But this didnt  help Mr L because he wasnt  able to purchase  a 
flight using cash.  He said he had to use someone  elses bank details to book his flight  home, 
which caused them to go overdrawn  and experience  financial difficulties. 
On 20 March 2019 Mr L visited his local NatWest branch  to complain that it had refused to 
tell him the full PAN as he had requested. But NatWest responded that its security policy 
prevented it from disclosing that information  over the telephone. So, it didnt think  it had done 
anything wrong. 
Being dissatisfied with NatWests response  to his complaint Mr L referred it to us. Our 
investigator looked into it and thought NatWest had dealt with this complaint fairly.  They  
thought its refusal  to disclose Mr Ls PAN was a reasonable  and security conscious 
approach. But Mr L disagreed  and asked for his complaint to be referred to an ombudsman
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im aware that Ive summarised  the events of the complaint. I dont intend any discourtesy by 
this - it just reflects the informal  nature of our service. Ive concentrated on what  I think  are 
the key issues. I can assure Mr L and NatWest that Ive read everything that they have  
provided. So if Ive not mentioned something  its not because I havent considered it. Its just 
that I dont  think I need to comment on it in order to reach what  I think is a fair and 
reasonable outcome.
Our investigator didnt  uphold Mr Ls complaint   either about the service he received from 
NatWest, how it dealt  with his complaint or the fact that it wouldnt provide the information  he 
wanted. Strictly speaking,  we dont have the power  to look at how financial businesses deal 
with complaint handling  as its not a regulated activity under the legislation  that governs 
our service.  So, even if I did think NatWest hadnt  done things well in this regard, I wouldnt 
be able to uphold  that element of Mr Ls concerns or make an award. I cant act outside the 
law. So, I wont spend any time in this decision on that. 
The key issue to this complaint is whether NatWest  acted  fairly in refusing to provide Mr L 
with the information he requested. In thinking about  this, Ive considered things from both 
sides. I realise that what happened must have been extremely frustrating.  But Im not 
Ref: DRN63678302persuaded NatWest  made a mistake  or acted unreasonably when it declined to disclose 
Mr Ls PAN. Ill explain  why.
Banks have a duty to have robust strategies to safeguard its customers accounts and their 
financial information. NatWest said it refused  to disclose  Mr Ls debit  card PAN in line with its 
security policy.  I think this is reasonable because I wouldnt expect a bank to provide a 
customer with their PAN over the telephone.  
I can understand that this was an inconvenient and frustrating experience for Mr L  
especially given that he satisfied all security checks.  But its reasonable for NatWest to have 
security processes in place, which restrict the financial information its able to provide its 
customers over the telephone. And its entitled  to determine its own policy  in this regard. So, 
we cant comment on whether a business policy is right or tell it that its policy  should be 
changed.  But, based on the evidence  Ive seen, Im satisfied NatWest  followed its security 
policy when it refused to disclose  Mr Ls PAN.  This means I cant fairly  conclude it made an 
error.
I appreciate Mr Ls comments that accessing cash wouldnt assist him in purchasing  a flight  
home. And I recognise that asking  someone  else to book a flight may have caused them 
financial difficulties. However,  I cant hold NatWest responsible for the fact that Mr L was 
without access to his debit card. And Ive already explained  why I cant  criticise it for not 
disclosing his PAN.  It follows  that I cant fairly ask NatWest to reimburse a third party for any 
loss they may have  incurred in booking Mr Ls flight home.
Mr L says NatWest didnt tell him how he could transfer funds to another  person. Like our 
investigator, Ive listened to the calls Mr L and his mother made to NatWest  during March 
2019. During each  telephone call, Im satisfied NatWest provided  helpful information and 
explained clearly  how Mr L could access cash while without access to his debit card. I cant 
hear Mr L asking NatWest how to transfer  funds to another  person. So I cant fairly  criticise 
NatWest for not commenting on something  it wasnt asked about.  
I understand Mr L feels very strongly  about  the issues raised in this complaint. And I 
sympathise with the difficulties he found himself  in. But taking everything into consideration, 
NatWest hasnt done anything wrong  here and, because  of this, I wont be asking it to do 
anymore.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 April 2020.
