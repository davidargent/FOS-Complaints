The complaint
Miss M complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) was irresponsible in approving her credit 
card applications and increasing the credit limits on her accounts.
What happened
Miss M held five credit card accounts with NewDay, all of which were opened in the period 
from 2017 to 2019. The credit limits across the accounts were increased multiple times in the 
period from 2018 to 2020. In 2021, Miss M complained that NewDay had been irresponsible 
in lending to her and increasing the credit limits. 
She said that, if NewDay had carried out appropriate checks, it would have seen that she 
was struggling financially and that the increased borrowing wasnt affordable for her. She 
said that NewDay made her financial position worse by increasing the credit limits. She 
asked NewDay to refund all the interest and charges she had paid following each credit limit 
increase from 2018 onwards and pay her interest on the refunds. She also asked it to 
remove adverse information from her credit file from that point onwards.
NewDay upheld the complaint. It didnt think all of the credit limit increases had been unfair. 
But, for four of the accounts, it identified a particular credit limit increase which it didnt think 
should have happened. In each case, it refunded interest and charges arising from that 
credit limit increase. The refunds were credited to each of those four accounts.
In relation to the fifth account, which was opened in December 2019, NewDay said it 
shouldnt have allowed Miss M to open that account. It refunded the interest and charges to 
Miss M direct, as the account had been settled and closed by the time NewDay responded 
to the complaint.
NewDay said it couldnt amend Miss Ms credit file, as it has a duty to report accurate 
information about the accounts. And it declined to pay Miss M interest on the refunds.
Miss M wasnt happy with NewDays response and brought the complaint to this service. 
She asked us to look at whether NewDay should pay interest, given that it had upheld her 
complaint. And she wanted adverse information about the accounts to be removed from her 
credit file.
Our Investigator didnt think NewDay had acted unfairly and didnt ask it to do any more. But 
Miss M didnt agree and asked for her complaint to be reviewed by an Ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When assessing Miss Ms credit card applications, NewDay needed to check whether she 
would be able to repay the credit offered in a way which was sustainable and which wouldnt 
adversely affect her financial situation. There arent set checks which NewDay needed to 
make, but it needed to carry out checks which were proportionate to things like the amount 
of credit Miss M was applying for and the information she provided about her financial 
situation. Before significantly increasing the credit limit on Miss Ms accounts, NewDay 
needed to assess her creditworthiness and consider how her financial situation may be 
affected.
NewDay says it is a second chance lender, whose accounts are designed to help customers 
with lower credit ratings. As such, it says it allows a certain amount of negative information 
on a customers credit report when assessing applications. But it says it carried out checks 
before making each lending decision here. In doing so, NewDay says it relied on information 
provided by Miss M and data from the Credit Reference Agencies. It says this information 
gave no indication of financial hardship or vulnerability.
From the information Ive seen, Im satisfied that NewDay made appropriate checks before 
opening the accounts and increasing the credit limits. Ive also considered whether the 
lending decisions it went on to make were reasonable, based on the information it obtained 
from the checks. I think they were, up until around October 2019. The information Ive seen 
shows that, around that time, Miss Ms overall indebtedness increased significantly. I dont 
think any credit limit increases should have been made on any of the accounts from that 
point onwards. Nor do I think any further accounts should have been opened after that point.
The solution I would propose for putting this right now would be for NewDay to refund all 
interest and charges which result from any credit limit increases or new credit card accounts 
from October 2019 onwards. NewDay has effectively accepted this already, as it has 
refunded interest and charges arising from all credit limit increases which took place after 
August 2019 across four of the accounts. For the fifth account, which was opened in 
December 2019, it offered to refund all the interest and charges. I think thats fair. As 
NewDay has already done what I would ask it to do to put things right, Im not going to ask it 
to do anything else here.
I dont think NewDay needs to pay interest on the amounts it has refunded. Thats because 
the four oldest accounts had outstanding balances at the time the refunds were made. 
Therefore, the refunds didnt need to be paid to Miss M to reimburse her for payments she 
had made to NewDay. Instead, they were put towards reducing the account balances 
directly. I havent seen any detailed information about the fifth account. But the information I 
have seen shows that it was settled only very shortly before NewDay responded to the 
complaint. In light of this, and given the amount of the refund involved, I think any interest on 
the refunded amount would be of a very small, token amount. Taking into account the overall 
circumstances here, Im not going to ask NewDay to pay any interest to Miss M.
Finally, I dont think any amendments need to be made to Miss Ms credit file. Thats 
because I think its fair for any entries to reflect the fact that Miss M had the benefit of the 
credit which NewDay provided, in the sense that she used the credit which NewDay made 
available and the account balances reflected that. I dont find it likely that any negative 
entries arise purely from the interest which was applied as a result of the increased credit 
limits (which has in any event been refunded).
Im sorry to disappoint Miss M, but I think NewDay has already done enough to put things 
right here. So Im not going to ask it to do any more.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept or reject my decision before 1 November 2022.
