* additional borrowing
One of our adjudicators looked  at this complaint and thought that CEN  should put things  
right for Mr H from the fourth deferral of Loan 1 through to the last additional borrowing 
approval  Loan  10b. CEN did not agree.  The complaint remains  unresolved and was 
passed to me for a decision. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what I consider  to be 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general 
approach to complaints about  short-term  lending - including  all of the relevant rules, 
guidance and good industry  practice  - on our website. 
Ref: DRN22396872CEN needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CEN  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include: 
where a customers income  is particularly  low; where the repayments are particularly high;  
and/or where  the frequency of the loans and the length of time over which  a customer  has 
been given loans needs to be looked  at: repeated refinancing could signal that the borrowing 
had become, or was becoming, unsustainable.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CEN was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the regulatory bodies  in place  at the time defined sustainable as 
being the ability to repay  without undue difficulties. In particular the customer should  be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments, and without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all of the arguments,  evidence and information provided  in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Loan 1 was deferred several times and by the fourth  occasion CEN ought  to have taken into 
consideration that Mr H was having trouble making the loan repayments.  The repeated 
deferrals did not assist Mr H as it increased  the amount of interest due for that loan and 
pushed back the date for repaying the principal sum due. It would have been  fairer at the 
time Mr H asked  for the fourth  deferral  to have considered a repayment  plan. Instead, it was 
deferred again and he incurred late fees. I agree with the adjudicators view that this fourth 
deferral ought  not to have  been  approved. 
Three days after repaying that principal sum on 12 November  2010 Mr H applied  for a 
further loan for the same  amount - £200  on 15 November 2010.  It was approved. So at 
that stage CEN had information about his income,  some personal details and knowledge  of 
his repayment  history for Loan 1. I have  been given a list of the credit  searches CEN has 
said it carried out, but I have not been  given the results of those searches. The sequence of 
events with the repayment  history  of Loan 1 means  that CEN was on notice that Mr H was 
not likely  to be able to sustainably repay Loan  2. 
So I do uphold Mr Hs complaint for Loan  2.
Ref: DRN22396873I have also looked  at the overall pattern of CENs lending history  with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which CEN should reasonably have  seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Mr H should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
Loan 3. I say this because:
Loan 3 was the third loan in under 8 months  and he had taken long periods of time to 
repay Loans 1 and 2;
from Loan 3 onwards  Mr H was provided with a new loan within days  of settling  a 
previous one and often  on the same day. So CEN ought to have realised it was more 
likely than not Mr H was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Hs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably;
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed CEN.  Loan 10 was for 
£1,100 and was taken  out three and a half years after Mr Hs first. And it was for a 
larger amount. Mr H had paid large  amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to 
CEN over an extended period.
I think that Mr H lost out because CEN continued  to provide borrowing from Loan 3 onwards  
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time; 
additional funds  were approved during some of the loans as well;
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Hs ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So I am upholding the complaint about Loans 3 to Loan 10 including 10b and CEN should 
put things right for Mr H.
putting things right  what CEN needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on the loans  from the fourth deferral of 
Loan 1, through to Loan 10b; and 
pay interest of 8% simple  a year* on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about the fourth deferral to Loan 1 (if this is 
possible) and Loan 2 from  Mr Hs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from  Loan 3 onwards means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  Loans 3 to 10b should  be removed from 
Mr Hs credit file.
Ref: DRN22396874* HM Revenue & Customs requires CEN to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr H a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I am upholding Mr Hs complaint in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
should do as I have set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 November  2019.
