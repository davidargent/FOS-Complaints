The complaint
Mr L complains that National Westminster Bank Plc caused problems with his support for 
mortgage interest payments.
What happened
Mr L took out a mortgage with NatWest in 2017. He became unemployed and made a claim 
for support for mortgage interest (SMI) in 2019. The Department of Work and Pensions 
(DWP) has made payments into his account from late 2019, backdated to June 2019.
In early August 2020 Mr L received a letter from the Department for Communities. This said 
it had sent his lender numerous forms for an up to date mortgage balance for June 2020, 
and hadnt received these back. It said it would suspend payments until the information was 
returned and Mr L should contact his lender and ask it to send the information. 
Mr L contacted NatWest. He was understandably concerned that payments would be 
stopped and the impact this might have on his credit file.
NatWest said it received the form on 28 July 2020 and returned it on 10 August, which was 
within the time allowed by the DWP. 
Our investigator said NatWest responded within the required timescales and no payments 
were missed. He said NatWest isnt responsible for any issues with the post or at the DWP. 
Mr L didnt agree. He said he continues to receive letters from the Department for 
Communities saying NatWest hasnt returned the necessary forms, and it only continued 
payments because he provided medical evidence about how this was affecting his health.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the 
balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in 
light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances. 
It must have been upsetting for Mr L to receive a letter from the Department for Communities 
saying it might suspend SMI payments to his mortgage account. Mr L has said how this 
affected him. Mr L is concerned that payments continue to be made to his account, and not 
stopped due to an error outside his control, whether made by the DWP, NatWest or the 
postal service. I do understand this  although I can only look into what NatWest has done 
here.
The Department for Communities told Mr L it sent forms to NatWest on 5 May, 17 July and 
3 August 2020. 
NatWest says it received a form on 28 July and returned it on 10 August 2020. It says this 
was within the DWPs required time scales. 
Most likely, the form sent by the Department for Communities on 17 July is the one NatWest 
says it received and returned. NatWest wouldnt have needed to do anything with the 
additional form sent in August, as it was already actioning the request for information. While 
its possible that NatWest received and didnt action the form sent by the Department for 
Communities in May 2020, its also possible it didnt receive it. Its not clear that NatWest 
was at fault here.
If NatWest had made an error and this resulted in payments to Mr Ls account being stopped 
Id expect it to put matters right. As Ive said, its not clear that NatWest made an error. And, 
whats most important here, is that no SMI payments were missed. NatWest has confirmed 
this, and that it didnt record anything on Mr Ls credit file. 
Nonetheless, it must have been a shock for Mr L to receive a letter from the Department for 
Communities saying it might suspend SMI payments to his mortgage account. I appreciate 
this causes Mr L ongoing worry  although I cant look into more recent issues which werent 
part of the complaint that Mr L brought to us. NatWest has pointed out that it hasnt let Mr L 
down so far, and no SMI payments have actually been missed. Im sorry that I cant provide 
more reassurance to Mr L. But as there were no missed SMI payments and no adverse 
impact on Mr Ls credit file in mid-2020 theres nothing for me to require NatWest to put right. 
NatWest said it should have told Mr L about the timescales for returning the forms, and it 
offered to pay for his phone calls if he provides evidence of the cost. I think this is fair and 
leave it to Mr L to decide whether he wants to do this. 
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 August 2021.
