K822xcomplaint
Ms N complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) refunded  an overpayment on 
her mortgage, despite having been  told not to do so.
background
Ms Ns mortgage payments were being made by the Department for Work and Pensions 
(DWP) on her behalf. In March 2018  Ms N was told that the payments would cease. Ms N 
contacted NatWest to say that from April 2018 onwards she would make  the mortgage  
payments due.
In April 2018 Ms N rang NatWest to check that it had received her mortgage payment for the 
month. Ms N says she was told that her payment had been  received and a payment towards 
her mortgage had also been  made by the DWP for £111.66.
In September  2018 NatWest refunded the overpayment of £111.66.  Ms N complained to 
NatWest as she had told the bank not to refund the overpayment. Ms N said she wanted to 
use the money to reduce her mortgage balance.
Our adjudicator said he didnt think Ms Ns complaint should be upheld. Initially he said he 
couldnt find anything  to show that Ms N had told NatWest not to refund  the payment.
When I reviewed  the file I noted  that NatWests records showed  that on 7 September 2018 
Mrs N spoke to NatWest  about her mortgage. These  records  showed  that Ms N complained 
that it had wrongly  taken  the full mortgage  payment from her in April 2018 despite the DWP 
having made a contribution towards  the mortgage.  The notes said:
'Cust wants  the £111.66 refunded back.'
NatWest's records show that it agreed  to refund the overpayment to Ms N's bank account.  
But, later that day its records show that Ms N spoke to NatWest again.  Notes made by 
NatWest at the time say:
.. Call to advise that refund  was being processed for £111.66 to the sourcing account of the 
mortgage - Mrs advised  she does  not want the refund and would  prefer to keep it in 
her capital balance.'
(bold is my emphasis)
I asked our adjudicator  to let Ms N know that the information available  from NatWest did 
show that she had told it not to refund  the overpayment. Our adjudicator  re-considered 
Ms Ns complaint in light of this information. But said he was still of the view that he didnt 
think NatWest needed  to do anything.
He said that although NatWest hadnt followed Ms Ns instructions she hadnt  suffered a 
financial loss, so he didnt  think it needed  to do anything to put matters right for Ms N.
Ms N wasnt  satisfied with our adjudicators view. She explained  that she had tried hard to 
maintain her mortgage  payments. She said she was disappointed and frustrated that 
NatWest hadnt  followed  her instruction to use the overpayment to reduce  her mortgage 
balance.
Ref: DRN51907662I issued my provisional decision on Ms Ns complaint  on 13 August 2019.  I said that my 
provisional decision was that I intended to uphold this complaint.
I said it was clear from NatWests records that Ms N had told it not to refund the 
overpayment. I said it was disappointing that NatWest had failed to act on this instruction, or 
help to put matters  right.
I noted that NatWest  had said it didnt know why it didnt do as Ms N had requested and use 
the overpayment  to reduce the mortgage  balance. 
I said that I appreciated that it may have been  too late to recall the refund, if it was already 
being processed. But I said I thought that NatWest should have explained  the situation to 
Ms N and helped her to return  the money and use it to reduce her mortgage balance.
I noted that NatWest  had said that Ms N could  use the money to make  an overpayment  if 
she now wanted to do so. I said that if Ms N contacted NatWest  to make an overpayment it 
should assist her. I also said it should  ensure that the overpayment was backdated to the 
date it should  have been credited to her mortgage  account.
I also said I was mindful  that this matter has caused  Ms N some trouble  and upset and I 
thought that NatWest should compensate Ms N for this.
Having carefully considered this matter, my provisional view was that NatWest  should pay 
Ms N £100  for the trouble and upset caused. I explained that I had reached  this view as it 
was clear that Ms N has been put to some trouble in trying to understand why the 
overpayment was returned to her and why her instruction  had not been acted on.
NatWest accepted my provisional decision.  
Ms N said she was pleased that I had acknowledged  her inconvenience. 
She also made an alternative  proposal to the redress  I has set out in my provisional  
decision. Ms N said that, rather than receiving £100 for the trouble and upset this matter had 
caused she would like NatWest to pay £111.66 towards her mortgage, with the payment 
being backdated.  
Ms N said she would then keep the £111.66 that NatWest had returned to her in September  
2018. Ms N said she felt this would  ensure  that she wasn't inconvenienced  any further.
Ms N then spoke to our adjudicator again and said she wanted the payment to be backdated 
to April 2018, when  the DWP  made  the payment towards her mortgage. Ms N also said she 
wanted NatWest  to provide an up-to-date statement  showing  the overpayment had been  
applied to her mortgage  account.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN51907663I asked our adjudicator  put Ms Ns proposal  to NatWest. It said it was willing to pay £111.66  
towards her mortgage, and backdate  the payment. It also agreed that Ms N could keep the 
£111.66 it had refunded  to her in error.
I am pleased  that NatWest has agreed  to Ms Ns proposal.
I think Ms Ns proposal is sensible, but I think that the payment should be backdated to 
September 2018, the date Ms N told NatWest to credit the payment  to her mortgage 
account. This will put Ms N back in the position  she would have been in, but for NatWests 
error. 
my final decision
My decision  is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay £111.66  towards Ms Ns 
mortgage. This payment should be backdated to September 2018. NatWest  should  also 
provide Ms N with an up-to-date mortgage  statement showing that the payment has been 
correctly credited to her mortgage account.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 November 2019.
