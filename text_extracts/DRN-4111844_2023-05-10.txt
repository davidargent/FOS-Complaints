The complaint
Miss G complains that iGO4 Ltd (trading as WiseDriving) unfairly cancelled her motor
insurance policy. 
What happened
Miss G took out a policy for the year from late October 2021. The policy bore the name of
WiseDriving. It acted as an intermediary between Miss G and an insurance company.
The policy schedule said that the estimated annual mileage was 4,000 miles. The policy
was a telematics or black box policy. So there was a device in the vehicle that recorded
data including mileage.
The policy schedule and the policy terms said that Miss G was covered up to the number of
miles stated in the schedule. It said that if she was going to exceed that mileage, then she 
had to stop driving or buy top-up miles, otherwise WiseDriving would cancel the policy.
According to a welcome letter, Miss G also took out an optional extra. Including that, the total
cost was going to be about £1,600.00.
The WiseDriving terms of business included terms about fees. They included a telematics
fee of £150.00 in the first year or £90.00 in subsequent years, and a cancellation fee of
£75.00.
In early June 2022, Miss G changed her address on the policy, at an extra cost of about
£90.00.
A few days later in June 2022, she and WiseDriving had a telephone conversation about
mileage. After that call, WiseDriving increased the mileage to 5,000 miles.
On 9 August 2022, WiseDriving wrote an email to Miss G. It said shed driven 5,648 miles. It
said she should increase her mileage on the policy and, if she didnt do that by 16 August
2022, it would cancel her policy.
Miss G made calls to WiseDriving but didnt get through.
On 12 August 2022 (a Friday), Miss G emailed WiseDriving. She complained that shed
already increased her mileage limit, and she couldnt make further changes online or get
through on the telephone.
WiseDriving didnt respond to the email. On 17 August 2022, WiseDriving emailed Miss G
confirming that it had cancelled the policy.
WiseDriving wrote to Miss G saying that there was a balance outstanding as follows:
charge for insurance £1,235.51
optional extras £     79.99
non-refundable fees £     90.00
cancellation fee £     75.00
subtotal £1,480.50
less paid £1,337.47
balance to pay £143.03
On 18 August 2022, Miss G called WiseDriving and said shed increased her mileage from
4,000 by 5,000 miles. WiseDriving declined to reinstate the policy. Miss G complained to
WiseDriving.
By a final response dated mid-September 2022, WiseDriving upheld the complaint about not
responding to the email. It said it had agreed to honour one years no-claims discount. It also
said the following:
 your cancellation hasnt been recorded on any external database and there are
no markers against your name, therefore, you do not need to disclose that youve 
had a policy cancelled.
WiseDriving also said that Miss G owed £143.09, but it would remove the £75.00 fee,
reducing the balance to £68.09.
On about 10 October 2022, a debt collection agency asked Miss G o pay £143.09 and an
extra fee of about £20.00.
Shortly after that, Miss G brought her complaint to us. She asked us to direct WiseDriving to
remove all charges and pay compensation.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld in part. He thought that
Miss G did enough to get in touch and he thought Miss Gs policy was unfairly cancelled due
to poor service. He thought that it was unreasonable that Miss G was referred to debt
collectors as a result of poor service from WiseDriving.
He recommended that WiseDriving should pay Miss G £250.00 for distress and
inconvenience, less the £68.09, a balance of £181.91.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Miss G 
and to WiseDriving on 11 April 2023. I summarise my findings:
As shed already exceeded 5,000 miles, WiseDriving acted in line with the policy 
terms and its terms of business by giving Miss G seven days notice of cancellation.
If she wished to avoid cancellation, then Miss G needed not only to contact 
WiseDriving but to ask for and pay for mileage in excess of 5,000 miles.I wasnt minded that Miss Gs difficulty in contacting WiseDriving caused the 
cancellation of the policy. And I wasnt minded to find the cancellation unfair.
I wasnt minded that WiseDriving treated Miss G unfairly by asking her to pay
£68.09.
Id noted some difficulties in contacting WiseDriving and an incorrect request for 
more than £68.09. However, I kept in mind that Miss G had driven more miles than 
she was insured for, and she was reluctant to pay for any more. So I wasnt minded 
to find it fair and reasonable to direct WiseDriving to pay Miss G compensation for 
distress and inconvenience or to do any more in response to this complaint.
Subject to any further information from Miss G or from WiseDriving, my provisional decision 
was not to uphold this complaint. I didnt intend to direct iGO4 Ltd (trading as WiseDriving) to 
do any more in response to this complaint.
Miss G hasnt responded to the provisional decision.
WiseDriving accepted the provisional decision.
So I see no reason to change my view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
From the recording of the call in June 2022, I find that Miss G was aware that she was only
covered for 4,000 miles and that she had to pay extra to increase that. I accept that there
was a problem in making that change online.
I find that Miss G had only increased the mileage limit to 5,000 miles. And shed already
exceeded that mileage by August 2022.
From what had happened in June 2022, I consider that Miss G ought reasonably to have
known in August 2022 that she would have to pay more to cover the miles shed already
done in excess of 5,000 and the further miles she was likely to do before the policy was due
to expire in October 2022.
As shed already exceeded 5,000 miles, Im satisfied that WiseDriving acted in line with the
policy terms and its terms of business by giving Miss G seven days notice of cancellation.
If she wished to avoid cancellation, then Miss G needed not only to contact WiseDriving but
to ask for and pay for mileage in excess of 5,000 miles.
On 11 August 2022 and again on 12 August 2022, Miss G waited for nearly an hour before
abandoning her call.
Her email on 12 August 2022 didnt say that she had tried to make further changes and
further payment online. So I dont find that she had. Neither did her email express a wish to
make further changes and further payment.
Rather, Miss Gs email said that she had already made changes and said that shed
completed all that was required from her side. I dont accept that. Miss G hadnt asked for or
paid for mileage in excess of 5,000 miles.Also, when she spoke to WiseDriving on 18 August 2022, Miss G said shed increased her
mileage from 4,000 by 5,000 miles, that is to 9,000 miles. I havent found that correct. And I
find it likely that Miss G wouldve said much the same if shed got through on 11 or 12
August 2022.
So I dont find that Miss Gs difficulty in contacting WiseDriving caused the cancellation
of the policy. And I dont find the cancellation unfair.
WiseDriving had said in a final response that it would remove the £75.00 fee, reducing the
balance to £68.09. So I dont condone the later demand for the amount of £143.09 and an
extra fee of about £20.00. I hold WiseDriving responsible for that incorrect request.
However, Ive thought about the amounts (set out above) that lead to the balance of £68.09.
Im satisfied that the amount of £1,235.51 was set by the insurer rather than WiseDriving.
The amount £79.99 was non-refundable. The fee of £90.00 is the lower of the fees for the
black box. So I dont consider that WiseDriving treated Miss G unfairly by asking her to pay
£68.09.
Ive noted some difficulties in contacting WiseDriving and an incorrect request for more than
£68.09. However, I keep in mind that Miss G had driven more miles than she was insured
for, and she was reluctant to pay for any more. So I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct 
WiseDriving to pay Miss G compensation for distress and inconvenience or to do any more 
in response to this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct iGO4 Ltd (trading as WiseDriving) to do any more in response to this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 7 June 2023.
