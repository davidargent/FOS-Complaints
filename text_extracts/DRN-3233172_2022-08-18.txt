The complaint
Mr W complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) acted unfairly and unlawfully 
by disclosing his personal information to a third party.
What happened
Around May 2021, Mr W found out that NatWest had disclosed information about his 
account to a third party. After he complained, NatWest explained that it had received a 
request from a third party government body (who Ill refer to as M in my decision), so it was 
bound by law to respond to the request. The bank said it responded using a secure portal, 
so Mr Ws information remained secure. Mr W claims the request NatWest received was 
fraudulent and says the bank acted unlawfully by responding.
After Mr W asked this service to get involved, one of our investigators decided that NatWest 
acted fairly, as it responded to a request that it was legally obliged to respond to. The 
investigator didnt think that the bank had cause to challenge the validity of Ms request. 
Mr W didnt agree and asked for a final decision  so the complaint has been passed to me. 
Mr W remains adamant that Ms request was illegitimate and quoted several rules and 
regulations that he feels are relevant to his complaint and the wider issues surrounding Ms 
request.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I share the investigators opinion that NatWest acted fairly  I know Mr W will be 
disappointed to hear this, so Ill explain why.
First though I think it would be useful to clarify the remit of what I can consider. My role is to 
decide whether NatWest acted fairly. Mr W has submitted a fair amount of commentary 
about the wider issues related to Ms request and mentions several rules and regulations 
that he feels are relevant to these wider issues. But my powers dont allow me to consider 
Ms actions nor can I comment on any of the wider issues involved. So Ill only be 
commenting on whether NatWest treated Mr W fairly. 
In determining whether I think NatWest acted fairly and reasonably under the Financial 
Conduct Authoritys Dispute Resolution Rules, Ive taken into account what I think is 
relevant, including relevant law and regulations. 
NatWest is under an implied duty to keep Mr Ws information confidential. But, while this 
duty is an implied term of the bank and Mr Ws relationship, the duty isnt absolute. Case law 
points out that there are four circumstances under which disclosing confidential information 
is lawful. These circumstances, known as the Tournier principles permit the disclosure of 
confidential information:
Where the business is compelled by law to disclose the information
If the business has a public duty to disclose the information
If the business own interests require disclosure; and
Where the customer has agreed to the information being disclosed.
NatWest says it was obliged to respond to Ms request under law. Ive seen a copy of the 
request sent to NatWest by M, which sets out the relevant regulations that obliges the bank 
to respond to the request. Both Mr W and NatWest seem familiar with the relevant part of the 
regulations, so I wont quote or explain it again. The Tournier principles specifically permit 
NatWest to disclose Mr Ws confidential information where it is compelled to do so by law. 
Having considered the regulations in question, I think NatWest acted fairly by responding to 
Ms request because the relevant regulations compelled it to do so.
Mr W is concerned that Ms request wasnt genuine and says NatWest shouldnt have 
responded to the request knowing its legitimacy was in question. But looking at the letter 
from M, I cant see anything that makes me think NatWest had reasonable cause to 
challenge the legitimacy of the request. Theres nothing in the letter to suggest M didnt have 
the authority to request Mr Ws account information, nor is there anything to suggest the 
request was from anyone other than M itself. NatWest also says the information was sent 
securely to M, so Im satisfied that Mr Ws account information wasnt compromised either.
Based on the information Mr W has sent this service, it seems to me that he has wider 
concerns about the lawfulness of Ms actions. But, as I explained, its not for me to consider 
whether Ms acted lawfully. My powers are limited to considering NatWests actions and if it 
acted fairly by responding to Ms request  which I think it did. 
In summary, NatWest was obliged by law to respond to Ms request and case law sets out 
that NatWest can share confidential information in such circumstances. So I think the bank 
acted fairly.
My final decision
For the reasons above, Im not upholding this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 September 2022.
