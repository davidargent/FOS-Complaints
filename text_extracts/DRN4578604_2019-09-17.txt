K821x#15complaint
Ms T complained that she was mis-sold a credit  card payment protection insurance (PPI) 
policy. NewDay Ltd (NewDay) has taken responsibility for this complaint, so Ill refer to 
NewDay from now on.
background
Ive attached my provisional decision from August 2019, which forms part of this final 
decision. In my provisional  decision I explained  why I proposed  to uphold Ms Ts complaint. I 
invited NewDay and Ms T to send  in any further comments or evidence  they wanted me to 
consider by 28 September 2019,  before  I reached a final decision. Both responded before 
that date. Ms T said she had nothing further  to add. NewDay sent in a response to say that it 
agreed the complaint should  be upheld.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  As neither NewDay nor Ms T provided 
further evidence  or arguments for consideration, and NewDay  has agreed that the complaint 
should be upheld,  Ive no reason to change the conclusions set out in my provisional  
decision. So I uphold  Ms Ts complaint.
fair compensation
NewDay should put Ms T in the financial position  shed be in now if she hadnt  taken out PPI. 
The policy should  be cancelled  if it hasnt  been  cancelled already and:
A.NewDay should find out how much Ms T would owe on her credit card if the policy hadnt 
been added  to it.
So, it should  remove the PPI premiums added, as well as any interest charged  on those 
premiums. It should also remove any charges that were caused  by the mis-sale of the 
PPI  as well as any interest added  to those charges.
NewDay should then refund the difference between what Ms T owes and what she would 
have owed.
B.If  when NewDay works out what Ms T would  have  owed each  month without PPI  
Ms T paid more than enough to clear  her balance, NewDay should also pay simple 
interest on the extra Ms T paid. And it should carry on paying  interest  until the point 
when Ms T would have  owed NewDay something on her credit card. The interest rate 
should be 8% a year.
C.NewDay should tell Ms T what its done  to work out A and B.
If Ms T made a successful claim under the PPI policy, NewDay can take off what she got for 
the claim from the amount it owes her. NewDay can also deduct from the redress shown any 
commission redress repaid to Ms T in relation to this PPI sale.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires NewDay  to take off tax from this interest.  NewDay must give Ms T 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.

For the reasons  Ive explained, Ive decided to uphold  Ms Ts complaint. NewDay  Ltd should  
pay her the compensation Ive described. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 October  2019.

complaint
Ms T complained that she was mis-sold  a credit card payment protection insurance (PPI) policy. 
NewDay Ltd (NewDay) has taken responsibility  for this complaint, so Ill refer to NewDay from now 
on.
background
The information I have  is that Ms T took out the credit card in February  2003. Ms T said she took out 
the card and PPI in a meeting, but couldnt remember whether the PPI was recommended for her. 
NewDay hasnt provided us with information about the sale, but from a final response letter issued to 
Ms T in April 2018, (after  which the complaint  was referred  to us) I can see that it told Ms T that the 
PPI was selected on the credit  card application  form and no advice was offered. Ms T said that she 
didnt know that PPI had been added to the card and the cost and policy terms werent explained. 
NewDay has not provided  any information  about the policy,  so I dont have details of the cost.  We 
have in our records  a policy  document from the card provider from the year of the sale,  and I think its 
reasonable to take this as broadly representative of the policy terms that wouldve  applied to Ms Ts 
account. But if NewDay provides a copy of the policy  applicable  to Ms Ts account, and the terms 
differ from the policy  I have,  I will look at this again. The policy document  in our records suggests  that 
the PPI provided  accident,  sickness  and unemployment  cover for Ms T. If shed  successfully claimed 
on the policy, each month it wouldve paid out 3% of what she owed on the card when  she stopped 
working. This wouldve carried on for up to 12 months  per claim. The policy also included life cover.  
NewDay argued that this service did not have the power to consider the complaint,  saying that Ms T 
had first complained  to it in 2012,  and at that time had been issued with a final response letter giving 
her the usual six-month period to refer her complaint to this service. It further said that as the 
complaint I am now considering  was referred to us in 2018,  this is well outside the time limits  that we 
are required to apply. 
A colleague  issued a jurisdiction decision  in November 2018 stating, in summary, that as NewDay 
couldnt provide a copy of the final response letter from 2012, and the computer records it provided 
did not provide sufficient evidence  that such a letter had been issued to Ms T or her representative, 
the complaint was not outside the time limits  and therefore we could consider it. Our adjudicator went 
on to issue his assessment  saying that Ms Ts complaint should be upheld. 
NewDay disagreed, sending in further computer records of Ms Ts complaint, and reiterating  its 
argument that the complaint was made outside the relevant time limits, and as such  this service  did 
not have the power to consider it. Ms Ts complaint has therefore been passed to me for review. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of 
PPI on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding Ms Ts case.
I am minded  to conclude that this service does have  the power to consider Ms Ts complaint,  and that 
it should  be upheld. Ill explain why.
I have carefully considered  NewDays further submissions about its previous handling  of Ms Ts 
complaint, and indeed asked for further information to clarify the meaning  of some  of the entries  on 
the computer  records. 
NewDay sent in a copy  of the original  complaint  letter in 2012, and as far as I can see from the 
computer records it was acknowledged  shortly  afterwards  the records refer to such an 
Ref: DRN45786044acknowledgement. And the complaint is later marked as closed with the entry  letter policy   
additional information. I asked for a copy of the text of this letter,  which NewDay provided, but this 
simply asks Ms T  through her representative   to complete a questionnaire and return  it within  14 
days. None of the information provided  by NewDay  is identifiable  as being a record of a final response 
letter in the required format  that is, stating that Ms T had six months in which to refer the complaint 
to this service  having been  issued in response to the complaint in 2012.  As a result,  I have no 
reason to change my colleagues earlier  conclusion  that this service does have the power  to consider 
Ms Ts complaint.
On that basis,  I have  also considered  the merits of Ms Ts complaint.  
As NewDay has not provided any information about  the sale (other  than what  was in the final 
response letter in 2018), and said that it did not have a copy of the credit card agreement, I have 
based my provisional decision on the limited  information  I do have, along  with what  we know about  
other sales by the same provider  in the same time period. 
Ms T said that the card and PPI were sold in a meeting, and I have  no information to contradict  that. 
As I mentioned earlier,  NewDay  said that no advice was given, and Ms T selected the PPI when filling 
out the application form. It also said that Ms T wouldve been given a copy  of the full policy terms and 
conditions when she applied.  
Ms T said she was self-employed at the time of the sale. As Ive explained, I have taken  into 
consideration a policy document from the card provider  from the year of the sale, which  we have in 
our records.  If NewDay  can provide more information about the sale generally, and the policy  terms 
differ, I will look at this again.
In relation to self-employed people, the policy says the following:
Cover applies in the event  of bankruptcy, liquidation or official  termination  of self-employed  status 
due to failure of business. Temporary cessation of trading or periods of unemployment due to 
shortage of work are not covered. Evidence of cessation  must be provided .
I can see from this that it wouldve been more  difficult for Ms T to claim  for unemployment as a self-
employed person than an employed person  - she would be had to be declared bankrupt  or totally 
ceased trading. And I dont  think Ms T wouldve taken the PPI if shed  understood this. 
I have no information about how the policy was explained to Ms T  but Im not satisfied she wouldve 
taken the PPI if shed been properly informed.  As a result Im minded to uphold Ms Ts complaint  and 
to require  NewDay to put things right.  
fair compensation
NewDay should  put Ms T in the financial position shed  be in now if she hadnt taken  out PPI. The 
policy should be cancelled if it hasnt been cancelled already  and:
A. NewDay should find out how much  Ms T would owe on her credit card if the policy  hadnt been 
added to it.
So, it should remove the PPI premiums  added, as well as any interest charged on those  
premiums. It should also remove any charges that were caused by the mis-sale of the PPI  as 
well as any interest added to those charges.
NewDay should  then refund the difference between what Ms T owes and what she would have 
owed.
Ref: DRN45786045B. If  when NewDay  works out what Ms T would  have owed each month without PPI  Ms T paid 
more than enough to clear her balance, NewDay should also pay simple interest  on the extra  
Ms T paid. And it should  carry on paying interest until the point when Ms T would have owed 
NewDay something on her credit card. The interest rate should  be 8% a year.
C. NewDay should tell Ms T what its done to work out A and B.
If Ms T made  a successful claim  under the PPI policy, NewDay can take off what  she got for the claim  
from the amount  it owes her. NewDay  can also deduct from the redress shown any commission 
redress repaid to Ms T in relation to this PPI sale.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires  NewDay to take off tax from this interest.  NewDay must  give Ms T 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I propose to uphold Ms Ts complaint,  and to require  NewDay Ltd to 
pay her the compensation  Ive described.
