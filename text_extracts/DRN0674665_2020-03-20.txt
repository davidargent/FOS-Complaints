K821x#15complaint
Mr P says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him. He says the loans were unaffordable  for him and he got into a debt cycle which led to 
a worsening of his financial  situation.
background
This complaint is about one running  credit facility followed  by 13 short-term  loans (Ill refer to 
all borrowing as loans in my decision) Sunny provided to Mr P between November 2014  
and July 2015. Mr Ps borrowing history  is as follows:

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ps complaint  and thought  the loans from loan six 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. They also thought that all information about  the 
borrowing from loan six was adverse and should  be removed from Mr Ps credit file. 
Sunny disagreed but then offered to uphold the complaint about loans 13 and 14 but Mr P 
rejected this offer.
Another of our adjudicators reconsidered  the complaint before it was passed to me. He 
agreed that loans  from loan six shouldnt have been  given but didn't think  Mr Ps credit  file 
should be amended to the extent recommended by the previous adjudicator. He thought only 
adverse information  should be removed from Mr Bs credit file and not all information  for 
loans six and seven.  But our adjudicator agreed  that any information about loans from loan 
eight was adverse  and should be removed from Mr Ps credit file. 
Neither party gave  me anything  more to consider and as the complaint remains  unresolved it 
has been passed to me to decision in my role as ombudsman. 
my findings
Ref: DRN06746652Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr P didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to five shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  these  loans. So I 
wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But the loans were  part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr P had with Sunny.  So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
Ref: DRN06746653In its response to Mr Ps complaint, Sunny explained  that it carried out affordability checks  
and obtained information about Mr Ps financial circumstances from him and credit 
references. 
But as our adjudicator  explained, a proportionate check  for loan six would most likely have 
shown that Mr P:
Was struggling to manage his finances.  I say this because  the amounts Mr P was 
borrowing each month were  increasing - £500  for both January and February 2015, 
£750 in March. And loan six was at the beginning of April where  first loan was for 
£500 but in total he borrowed £1,050  in that month. 
Sunny  should  have  built a better  picture  about Mr Ps financial circumstances. The 
financial information Sunny has given us about  Mr P shows  that it only was aware of 
his income and credit expenditure.  There wasnt any record  of his monthly essential 
expenditure such as rent/mortgage  or utility bills as examples.  So I dont agree that 
Sunny did carry out proportionate checks to ascertain  Mr Ps financial circumstances 
and whether he could afford the borrowing. 
I note that Mr P was developing  a pattern of borrowing very quickly  once a previous 
loan had been repaid   loan three was taken the same day that loan two was paid off 
and loan four was taken the same  day that loan three  was paid off.  Loan five was 
taken a week after loan four was repaid and loan six was taken a day after loan five 
had been repaid.  This borrowing could suggest  Mr P was juggling with his finances 
and not managing them effectively.
Sunny  has said that because Mr P repaid his loans early,  this wasnt  consistent with 
someone who was in financial difficulty.  But I disagree. And while  I appreciate early 
loan repayment  saves interest  charges, it can equally be an indication that Mr P was 
struggling to manage his finances  and was borrowing to repay current  debts. This is 
one of Mr Ps complaint points. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr P, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
eight. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr P was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr P had taken out eight loans within five months and the monthly  
amounts being  borrowed  were  increasing  from £500 in January to £1,050 in April.  
So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr P was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loans was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ps indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ps borrowing  pattern continued  in that he was provided with a new loan within 
days of settling a previous  one. As examples, loan eight was taken  the next day after 
loan seven was repaid  and loan ten was taken the same day loan nine was repaid. 
Ref: DRN06746654Mr P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 14 was 
taken out eight months after loan one. Mr P had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr P lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan eight 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing  
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  which  Mr P borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ps ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans six to 14 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on loans six to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans six and seven from Mr Ps credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan eight onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans eight  to 14 should be removed from 
Mr Ps credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr P a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ps complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 April 2020..
