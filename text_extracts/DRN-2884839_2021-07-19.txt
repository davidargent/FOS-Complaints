The complaint
Mr A complains that TransUnion International UK Limited didnt respond to his request to 
remove a third partys data from his credit file.
What happened
In December 2020, Mr A complained to TransUnion after he noticed an entry on his credit 
file that belonged to his wife.
Mr A didnt hear back from TransUnion so he complained to it in February 2021. TransUnion 
sent Mr A its final response in March 2021. TransUnion told him that it would pass his 
complaint to its data disputes team. TransUnion said that it didnt uphold Mr As complaint 
but didnt give reasons why.
The investigator recommended that Mr As complaint be upheld. He thought TransUnion 
shouldve done more than it did. The investigator asked TransUnion to pay £150 
compensation. And if it hadnt done so already, the investigator told TransUnion it should 
raise a dispute on behalf of Mr A.
Mr A accepted the investigators recommendation, but TransUnion didnt. It explained that it 
disputed the entry on behalf of Mr A. TransUnion said the credit provider had said the 
account was correctly reported so it had no authority to remove the entry from Mr As credit 
file.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
TransUnion says it has carried out what was expected when it disputed the entry. But that as 
the credit provider says the entry is correct, Mr A should take it up with the credit provider.
Although TransUnion says that it raised a dispute, it hasnt given us further details of this. 
And I cant see evidence that TransUnion told Mr A the outcome of its investigation. 
I wouldve reasonably expected TransUnion to deal promptly with Mr As challenge. But from 
the limited information we hold, I cant see that this happened. 
I agree with the investigator that its reasonable to require TransUnion to pay compensation 
for the trouble that Mr A has experienced trying to resolve his query. The figure of £150 that 
the investigator recommended seems fair and reasonable to me.
I dont have any reason to doubt that TransUnion did raise a dispute with the third party, but 
it shouldve told Mr A the outcome. As I cant see that TransUnion has done this yet, I direct 
it to give Mr A as much detail as it can about the dispute it raised on his behalf. It will then be 
up to Mr A to take this further with the credit provider.
Putting things right
TransUnion International UK Limited should communicate the outcome of the dispute that it 
raised on Mr As behalf and pay him £150.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I direct TransUnion 
International UK Limited to put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 August 2021.
