The complaint
Mr B complains that MotoNovo Finance Limited (MotoNovo) irresponsibly granted them a 
hire purchase they couldnt afford to repay. 
What happened
In January 2020, Mr B acquired a used car financed by a hire purchase from MotoNovo. 
Mr B was required to make 59 monthly repayments of £292.85. He paid a low deposit of 
£150. The total repayable under the agreement was £17,722. Mr B got into difficulty with 
meeting his repayments soon after taking out the agreement and so MotoNovo agreed to 
him deferring several payments . 
Mr B says that MotoNovo didnt complete adequate affordability checks. He says if it had, it 
would have seen the agreement wasnt affordable and that he didnt have a regular income. 
MotoNovo didnt agree. It said that it carried out a thorough assessment which included 
checking a credit register for details of any sums Mr B owed to other creditors. Mr B has 
continued to experience difficulty in making repayments under the agreement with MotoNovo 
agreeing to several deferrals of payment. 
Our investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. He thought MotoNovo didnt act 
unfairly or unreasonably by approving the finance agreement.
Mr B didnt agree and said MotoNovo ought to have done more to find out about the stability 
of his employment situation. 
The case has therefore been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
MotoNovo will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we 
consider when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. So, 
I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about our 
approach to these complaints is set out on our website. 
The credit check MotoNovo completed showed some details about a loan and two credit 
cards Mr B had at the time, as well as other committed expenditure. MotoNovo says it also 
showed hed missed payments on his current account around 12 months before starting his 
agreement, as well as missed payment with a communication supplier. Whilst MotoNovo has 
said this led to it carrying out further checks, I think this ought to have indicated that Mr B 
was likely to have been struggling financially. It therefore would have been proportionate for 
MotoNovo to have gained a more thorough understanding of Mr Bs financial circumstances 
before lending. I say this especially given that Mr B was taking on a five-year commitment 
with a level of monthly repayment that was well in excess of the low deposit hed had to pay 
to secure the car he wanted. 
I cant be certain what Mr B would have told MotoNovo had it asked about his regular 
expenditure. I dont necessarily think MotoNovo needed to request bank statements at the 
time it approved Mr Bs agreement  although Ive seen that it requested copies after he got 
into difficulty. But in the absence of anything else, Ive placed significant weight on the 
information contained in Mr Bs statements as an indication of what would most likely have 
been disclosed. 
Ive reviewed two months of bank statements prior to the application. These show that 
Mr Bs regular committed monthly expenditure at the time was around £224. In calculating 
this figure, Ive included loan, credit card and insurance payments. Ive also kept in mind that 
at the time Mr B was living at home with his parents and does not appear to have had 
regular financial commitments such as rent or utility costs to pay. At the time his income 
appeared to be around £1,230 based on the two sources of pay he was receiving. Taking 
these figures into account, it appears to show the agreement was affordable to Mr B. For this 
reason, Im not persuaded that MotoNovo acted unfairly in approving the finance. 
However, I agree with our investigator that in view of the financial difficulty Mr B continues to 
experience, MotoNovo ought to exercise forbearance with Mr B and take steps to explore all 
available options with Mr B, including termination of the agreement. 
Finally, I see that MotoNovo has offered Mr B £150 compensation because of errors in the 
way communicated with him about arrears on his account and an error in failing to properly 
set up his complaint initially. Having reviewed what happened, I think that offer is fair.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 June 2022.
