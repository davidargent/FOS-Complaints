The complaint
Miss H is unhappy that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money agreed to a loan 
shed applied for as she said it was unaffordable for her.
What happened
In August 2019, Miss H took out a £2,000 loan with 118 118, to be repaid over 24 months 
with repayments of £119.97 a month.
Miss H said 118 118 shouldnt have approved the loan as it wasnt affordable when all of
her circumstances were taken into consideration. She said she couldnt afford to repay the
loan as she was already in a cycle of borrowing each month. She also said shed tried 
gambling to help resolve her financial problems. Miss H complained to 118 118 as she didnt 
think theyd done enough to establish her true situation. Miss H said she couldnt afford the 
loan repayments, and 118 118 had acted irresponsibly in lending to her.
118 118 said theyd carried out reasonable and proportionate checks that showed the loan 
was affordable for Miss H. Miss H wasnt happy with their response and referred her 
complaint to us.
Our investigator said 118 118 had carried out a credit search and asked Miss H for details
of her income and expenditure at the time of the application. But said 118 118 should
have asked for further information to determine Miss Hs financial circumstances as the
information theyd looked at showed Miss H had recently increased her indebtedness.
Our investigator considered Miss Hs bank statements for the three months leading up to the 
loan application. He said these showed Miss H had sufficient disposable income to afford the 
repayments. He didnt ask 118 118 to do anything differently.
Miss H didnt agree, she said shed other commitments that werent considered including her 
overdraft that was close to its limit of £2,000 each month. Miss H asked for an ombudsman
to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im not upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
Considering the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice, I think the
overarching questions I need to consider in deciding whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint are whether 118 118 carried out proportionate checks.
And whether the loan made was affordable and sustainable for Miss H.
Regulations in place at the time 118 118 lent to Miss H required them to carry out a
reasonable assessment of whether Miss H could afford to repay the loan in a sustainable
manner. This is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or affordability
check.
The affordability checks should be borrower-focused, meaning 118 118 need to think
about whether repaying the loan sustainably would cause difficulties or adverse
consequences for Miss H. In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 to think only about
the likelihood that they would get their money back without considering the impact of
repayment on Miss H herself.
Checks must also be proportionate taking into account the specific circumstances of the loan
application. What constitutes a proportionate affordability check will generally depend on
several factors such as the specific circumstances of the borrower, their financial history,
current situation and whether there are any indications of vulnerability or financial difficulty.
Consideration should also be given to the amount, type and cost of credit theyre applying
for. This could mean a proportionate check could differ for the same borrower for different
loan applications.
So, Ive considered whether 118 118 in lending to Miss H had been thorough in the checks
they made. And whether theyve taken all these factors into account in deciding to lend to
her.
118 118 said Miss Hs credit checks didnt show she was having any difficulty in repaying
her existing financial commitments. 118 118 said the income and expenditure information 
provided suggested Miss H had a monthly income of around £1257. And that Miss H lived at 
home with her parents, paying £80 board each month. Her other outgoings each month 
totalled 944.25 which left Miss H with a disposable income of around £233. The application 
data for the loan showed it was to be used for consolidation of borrowing. If it was used in 
this way the expectation would be that the amount of disposable income Miss H had would 
increase. But even if it stayed at £233 considering the new loan repayment of £119.97, the 
loan still appeared to be affordable, as Miss H would have been left with around £113 in  
disposable income.
Ive looked at the credit report and this showed that Miss H had a total debt balance of  
£10,961. Shed 13 active accounts and had four new accounts in the previous six months, 
including a loan, two further credit cards and a mobile telephone account. I can also see that 
Miss H, in June 2019 had taken cash advances from a credit card amounting to £270. On 
seeing this information, I would have expected 118 118 to want to obtain a thorough 
understanding of Miss Hs true financial position - to satisfy itself that she could sustainably 
meet her loan repayments over the loan term. I think that 118 118 ought reasonably to have 
realised that for its checks to be reasonable and proportionate, in the circumstances, it 
needed to look further into Miss Hs financial position  for example by asking to see her 
bank statements.
Miss H has provided us with copies of her bank statements for the three months leading up 
to her loan application so I can determine what further checks might have shown 118 118 at 
that time.
The bank statements Ive seen are from mid-April 2019 to mid-August 2019. Ive considered 
the transactions up to when the loan was agreed  01 August 2019. I can see Miss H 
received an income of £1389.86 in May , £1345.43 in June and a total of £1656.03 in July, 
this equates to an average monthly income of £1463.77, higher than the income used by 
118 118 in their affordability calculations. I can also see regular transfers into the account 
from another account held by Miss H.The bank statements show Miss H had an overdraft facility of £2,000 and that throughout 
this period she was close to the limit and never running the account outside of the overdraft 
facility. But this is a student account and I cant see any charges were added to this account 
for the use of the overdraft.  
Looking at Miss Hs credit file I can see shed credit commitments totalling £652. She also 
had three credit cards with a total credit limit of £3800, of which £2,940 had been utilised. A 
catalogue shopping account with a limit of £2950, of which at July 2019 the credit file shows 
a balance of £963.This would have increased Miss Hs outgoings, based on a minimum 
payment of 5% by a further £147 for the credit cards and around £48 for the catalogue 
shopping account. Miss H said she was paying £80 board each month. This leaves a 
disposable income of around £537. In looking at Miss Hs bank statements I can see she 
also had some regular transactions for motoring costs, food, clothing and social media. So, 
Ive calculated Miss Hs disposable income to be around £437, by allowing £100 for the 
incidental transactions. I appreciate that circumstances may change, and Miss H has 
struggled in maintaining her repayments on the loan, but I cant say 118 118 were 
unreasonable in saying she had the disposable income to repay the loan at the time she 
applied for it.
Ive now considered whether 118 118 acted responsibly in lending to Miss H. I can see from 
the bank statements that Miss H did make several gambling transactions during this time, 
towards the end of April and in May 2019 her gambling transactions totalled, £325. Between 
end of May and June 2019, £548, end of June and July 2019, £120 and from the end of July 
and August 2019, after 118 118  agreed the loan I can see only one transaction for £20. 
While these transactions added to Miss Hs financial difficulty, I can also see Miss H was 
prevented by exceeding her overdraft limit by the transfer of funds from another account she 
had. And from Miss Hs credit file, I can see her other current account wasnt in an overdraft, 
during these times. Miss H has said she only tried gambling to try to help her financial 
situation, and that she has since stopped. And I think this is what 118 118 would have seen 
if theyd asked for Miss Hs bank statements.
Miss H has also referred to a loan where she was the guarantor and had to make monthly 
payments of £195 as the borrower had defaulted. But there isnt any record of this on Miss 
Hs credit file at the time the 118 118 loan was agreed. Neither can I see any repayments of 
this amount being taken from the bank statements Ive seen. 
Ive not seen anything to show that Miss H wasnt able to keep up repayments for her 
existing debt. And 118 118s records show the loan was for consolidation of Miss Hs debt, 
which would have increased Miss Hs disposable income. So, I dont think 118 118 would 
have an indication that Miss H couldnt maintain her existing commitments.
I know my decision will be disappointing for Miss H. But from what Ive seen I cant say 118 
118 acted irresponsibly in lending to her.  And Im pleased that she is now in a much better 
financial situation.My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 September 2021.
