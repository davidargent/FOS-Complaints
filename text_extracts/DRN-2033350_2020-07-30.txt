The complaint
Mr A complains that NewDay Ltd was wrong to approve him for a Debenhams branded 
credit card given his medical conditions. Hes also unhappy with the service he received 
when he contacted NewDay directly about his medical circumstances. 
To settle the complaint Mr A would like NewDay to close his account with no adverse effect 
on him and pay compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
What happened
In September 2019 Mr A says  while he was in a local store  he was approved for a credit 
card whilst making his purchases. His purchases totalled £25. 
But he says the card shouldnt have been approved as he suffers from various medical 
conditions which make it difficult for him to deal with credit. So he contacted NewDay to 
explain this, but he says he received poor customer service when he did so. 
NewDay says that its application process considers a number of factors to assess an 
applicants ability to repay any borrowing  such as, income and outgoings. But it doesnt 
specifically take into account any medical conditions. However, it accepted that when Mr A 
contacted it about his circumstances it couldve handled things better than it did. So, it paid 
Mr A £35 compensation  this put his account in credit by £10. 
Dissatisfied with NewDays response, Mr A brought his complaint to this service. At this 
point, NewDay said it would close Mr As account like hed requested  if he let it know 
where to transfer the £10 credit balance to, and remove any credit file information about this 
account from his credit file.    
One of our investigators looked into the matter and  overall, she felt NewDays total offer 
was fair. Mr A didnt agree, he felt more compensation was due. And he asked for an 
ombudsman to looked at his complaint. 
Since then NewDay has retracted its offer to remove the record of the account from Mr As 
credit file. Our investigator didnt think this altered things. She said that while the account 
would still appear on Mr As credit file, she felt it reflected an accurate record of events.  
Mr A didnt respond to this but as Mr A had asked for an ombudsman to look at his 
complaint, it has come to me to reach a final decision.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached broadly the same conclusion as our investigator. I know Mr A 
will be disappointed, so Ill explain why. 
I know Mr A thinks that NewDay shouldve taken into account his medical conditions when 
assessing the credit card application. But NewDay based its lending decision on the financial 
information Mr A provided in his application form i.e. his ability to repay the monthly 
repayment due each month based on his income. And I havent seen anything that would 
make me think NewDay wouldve been aware that Mr A suffered from any medical 
conditions which may have affected his ability to maintain a credit card satisfactorily at the 
time the application was made. So, I dont think NewDay did anything wrong when it 
approved the card in the first instance with regard to Mr As medical conditions. 
But I think NewDay was required to take Mr As medical conditions into account when he 
contacted it soon after the card had been approved. And, in this respect, NewDay hasnt 
disputed that it couldve handled things better than it did during its telephone conversations 
with Mr A. It acknowledges that its staff member failed to identify the problem when Mr A 
called and that he wasnt referred to the appropriate department straightaway. In this 
respect, NewDay apologised for the poor customer service, paid Mr A £35 compensation 
and passed his details to the appropriate department. 
Having thought carefully about the circumstances, as NewDay has accepted it could have 
provided a better service to Mr A than it did, I think compensation is due. So, the issue Im 
considering is whether NewDays £35 compensation payment is fair. And from the 
statements, I can see that the payment of £35 cleared the balance outstanding on Mr As 
card (£25)  a balance which Mr A wouldve had to pay had the compensation not been 
paid. and his account is now £10 in credit. And I can see that NewDay has told us that it will 
close Mr As if he lets it know where it should transfer the £10 credit balance to. So I would 
urge Mr A to contact NewDay with these instructions as soon as possible - if he hasnt 
already done so in the meantime. Overall, I think NewDay has done enough to put things 
right.
I accept that a record that the account existed will remain on Mr As credit file  but lenders 
are required to report accurate information on an account holders credit file. And as Ive 
found that NewDay wouldnt have been aware of Mr As medical conditions when it approved 
the credit card, I cant fairly say it should remove the record of the account as this is an 
accurate reflection of what happened. Once the account is closed, NewDay will update the 
credit file to show this.
 
Taking everything into consideration, given NewDay wouldnt have been aware of Mr As 
medical condition at the application stage and that it has acknowledged it couldve handled 
things better when Mr A contacted it directly and paid £35 compensation, I think the offer is 
fair. And so, I wont be asking NewDay to do anything more. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint  in the 
sense that the compensation already paid is fair.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 August 2020.
