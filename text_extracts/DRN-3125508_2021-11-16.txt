The complaint
Mr F complained because PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA wouldnt refund him for a disputed 
payment under its seller protection scheme. He said PayPal acted unfairly by refunding 
someone who had received his goods. 
What happened
Mr F advertised a laptop for sale on an internet e-commerce site. He received an email from 
a potential buyer on 14 September 2020. In the email exchanges, Mr F said he could have 
the laptop for £725 if he paid by bank transfer. But the buyer wanted to pay through PayPal 
and said we can pay £740 so you get some of the fee covered.
Mr F invoiced the buyer, and received a payment of £740 through PayPal, of which £703.44 
was for Mr F and £36.56 was PayPals fee. Mr F withdrew the money from his PayPal 
account. He says he sent the laptop to the buyer through Royal Mails tracked service, and 
that he had a signature for its receipt.
On 18 September, PayPal notified Mr F that his buyer had filed a claim saying they hadnt 
made the purchase, and asking for a refund of the £740 paid. PayPals email to Mr F said 
this transaction is eligible for seller protection.  It asked Mr F to provide information, 
including providing the tracking number. Mr R provided a Royal Mail tracking number. 
Mr F also contacted the internet e-commerce site, which said that it thought the buyers 
account had been used without the account owners permission. It told Mr F that it strongly 
recommended he should treat any future emails with caution, and shouldnt respond if he 
heard from that address again.
PayPal investigated Mr Fs claim for seller protection, but didnt accept it. It told Mr F that the 
transaction hadnt been authorised by the person hed thought was the buyer. So it had 
refunded the genuine account holder, and re-debited the £740 from Mr Fs account, leaving 
a negative balance. PayPal said the transaction hadnt been covered by its seller protection 
scheme. It asked Mr F to pay money into his PayPal account to cover the negative balance.
Mr F wasnt satisfied and complained to this service. He wasnt happy because PayPal had 
originally said hed be covered for seller protection, but had then told him he wasnt. He said 
PayPal had been hounding him to pay money into his PayPal account, including involving 
debt collectors.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Fs complaint. She explained that under PayPals seller 
protection policy, the seller had to send the item to the shipping address on the transaction 
details page in the sellers PayPal account. In practice this meant sending the item to the 
address which the buyer had provided when making the PayPal payment. PayPal use this to 
make sure the item went to the right place.
But Mr F had arranged the sending address direct with the buyer  and the disputed £740 
payment hadnt had shown a shipping address on it. This meant that PayPal couldnt provide 
valid proof of sending and delivery, to dispute the buyers claim. The Royal Mail signature 
which Mr F had provided didnt meet PayPals requirements.
Mr F had also complained because PayPal had charged the fee for the payment it had 
returned. But the investigator pointed out that the terms and conditions said that fees 
wouldnt be refunded.
Mr F had also told the investigator he was in financial difficulties, so she also provided 
details of organisations which could provide free debt advice. 
Mr F didnt accept the investigators view, and asked for an ombudsman decision. He said 
PayPal had acted unfairly, by giving money back to someone who had received his goods. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand that Mr F is frustrated at having sent the laptop and not receiving the money.  
But the seller protection scheme is a PayPal scheme, which is governed by the rules of the 
scheme. So Ive looked in detail at what PayPals seller protection scheme rules say. Mr F 
accepted those terms and conditions when he first opened his PayPal account.
The seller protection scheme rules say that the scheme may apply when a transaction is 
reversed because of a successful chargeback by a buyer, which is what happened here. 
But the rules go on to set out the basic requirements. Some of those (for example the 
country where the seller lives) were met by Mr F. But the problem is with the sections which 
said:
You must ship the item to the shipping address on the transaction details page in your 
PayPal account for the transaction. 

PayPal determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for PayPal seller 
protection. PayPal will make a decision, in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and 
eligibility requirements, any information or documentation provided during the resolution 
process or any other information PayPal deems relevant and appropriate under the 
circumstances.
I appreciate that Mr F told us that he arranged the shipping direct with the buyer, to 
accommodate the buyer, and that he had a signature which he says proves the laptop was 
received. 
But Mr F couldnt prove that hed shipped the item to the address on the transaction details 
page of his PayPal account. There was no address on the incoming payment to his PayPal 
account. Its clear from PayPals user agreement, and seller protection policy, that cover 
requires proof of shipping to the address on the transaction details page of the sellers 
account.
Without a matching shipping address on the transaction, combined with proof that the item 
had gone to and been received by that address, there was no proof that the item had gone 
to the right place. So Mr F didnt meet the requirements of PayPals seller protection. 
Its PayPals right to decide whether or not a claim is covered under its own policy. As Mr F 
couldnt meet that requirement, I cant say PayPal acted wrongly when it applied that 
requirement in its user agreement to Mr Fs claim.Mr F also complained that PayPal initially said the transaction was eligible for seller 
protection, then changed its mind. I can see that PayPal did say it was eligible, in its email of 
18 September. But that email told him to log in and provide the information it requested. So 
the wording wasnt a guarantee of a refund, just that the circumstances might mean a 
refund, subject to Mr F providing the necessary proof. He wasnt able to provide that backup 
evidence, so I dont consider theres a discrepancy here.
I can understand that Mr F was annoyed that part of the £740 which PayPal re-debited to his 
account related to £36.56 of PayPals fees. But Ive checked the terms and conditions, which 
say that all of the fees originally paid by you to receive the payment will not be returned to 
you. So Mr F wasnt eligible for a refund of those fees, again because hed signed up the 
terms and conditions when opening his account.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 December 2021.
