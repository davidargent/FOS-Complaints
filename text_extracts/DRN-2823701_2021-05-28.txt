The complaint
Mr S complains that TransferWise Limited (TransferWise) blocked a payment he tried to 
make through his account and requested he complete ID checks before the payment could 
proceed.
What happened
On 16 November 2019, Mr S sought to make a payment of Â£80 to an account in his name in 
Spain. TransferWise blocked the payment and asked him to send in a photo of himself next 
to an identification card.
Mr S sent the photo but cancelled the payment and complained, saying TransferWise had 
already verified him before and that they had taken his money. TransferWise cancelled the 
payment on the same day and told Mr S it would take two to 10 business days for the funds 
to clear into his account.
Mr S remained unhappy, so he brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator didnt 
uphold Mr Ss complaint. She said TransferWise was entitled to carry out due diligence 
checks and that it had acted in line with its legal and regulatory obligations, as well as the 
terms and conditions of the account.
Mr S disagreed. He felt TransferWise should conduct all of its security checks before it 
opened Mr Ss account. He asked for an ombudsman to review the matter afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
All financial institutions operating in the UK have to comply with various legal and regulatory 
obligations. Sometimes that means they have to review customers accounts or carry out 
security checks before they allow a payment to proceed.
The terms and conditions of Mr Ss account, that both he and TransferWise must comply 
with, allow TransferWise to carry out due diligence checks. They also state that such 
verification checks may extend the time for processing a payment.
Ive looked at the circumstances of this payment and Ive thought about the checks 
TransferWise carried out in relation to the payment in question. Having done so, Im satisfied 
TransferWise was entitled to ask Mr S to provide identification before it completed his 
payment. Ive seen nothing that says TransferWise cant carry out checks after an account 
has been opened  any such restriction wouldnt make sense as it would prevent 
TransferWise from complying with its ongoing legal and regulatory obligations.
Im also satisfied it acted promptly in completing its checks and complying with Mr Ss 
request to cancel the payment.
It follows that I dont consider TransferWise to have treated Mr S unfairly, and that I wont 
ask it to do anything further to put matters right for Mr S.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 June 2021.
