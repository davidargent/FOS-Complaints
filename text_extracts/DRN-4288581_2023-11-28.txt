The complaint
The estate of Ms L complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) 
bereavement process. 
What happened
When Ms L sadly passed away, her estate discovered she had an account with PayPal with 
an outstanding balance. 
When the late Ms Ls father contacted PayPal as one of the administrators of her estate to 
ask that the funds were transferred to his account, PayPal sent a list of documents that 
needed completing along with a request for identification. 
The estate of Ms L complain that they completed all of the necessary documents, then 
PayPal asked for a copy of the bank statement for the account that the money would be 
transferred to. As the estate of Ms L felt this was an unfair request, it logged a complaint with 
PayPal. 
PayPal looked into the complaint but didnt think it had done anything wrong. So, the estate 
of Ms L brought its complaint our service. 
Our investigator looked into the complaint and upheld it at first. Our investigator couldnt find 
any information that required a consumer to submit a bank statement as part of the wire 
transfer or bereavement process.
PayPal responded with a copy of its internal process, that it said evidenced that it had 
followed the correct process. Our investigator looked into the new information and found it 
changed her view, so she decided to not uphold the complaint. 
The estate of Ms L didnt agree with the investigators view or her change in opinion. So, the 
complaints been passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I intend to come to the same outcome as the investigator for largely the 
same reasons. Ill explain why.
I want to start by saying how extremely sorry I am to hear of the loss of Ms L. I can imagine 
the estate is going through a difficult time and its been made harder having to also deal with 
a complaint. 
For me to say PayPal did something wrong in this complaint, Id need to be satisfied that it 
failed to act within its internal policy. Or, if I feel like it did work within these, that it was unfair 
for it to do so in the circumstances of this complaint. And in this situation, I dont think thats 
the case. Ill explain why. 
As a service we wouldnt usually advise businesses on what process it should follow as part 
of its security procedures. Thats something as a business it has the autonomy to decide. 
Our service can look at whether it has applied the process or procedure fairly though. 
Having considered the documents PayPal has asked for here and the reasons for them, I 
havent found it has acted outside of its policy or unfairly with what its requested. PayPal 
has said it has requested a copy of a bank statement to make sure it matches the details 
completed on the wire transfer form. This seems like a reasonable request to me.  
Ive also looked at the timeline it followed when asking the estate of Ms L to supply 
documentation. PayPal told our service that it didnt ask for a bank statement when the 
estate of Ms L first made contact, as at that point it wasnt sure where the funds would be 
requested to be paid. Ive looked at the messages exchanged between PayPal and the 
estate of Ms L, and this is consistent with what PayPal has said. 
Once the estate of Ms L made PayPal aware that it would be going to an external account in 
the name of one of the administrators of the estate, it was at that point it asked for a bank 
statement. Im satisfied this was a reasonable request.  
Ive also checked the online bereavement process that the estate of Ms L wouldve had 
access to - this is something the estate of Ms L also refers to this in its communication with 
PayPal. The process looks to refer to paying money into an existing linked bank account, 
which is a different situation to what we have here, as the estate of Ms L want it paid into a 
new account not linked to the original PayPal account. 
In summary, I know the estate of Ms L feel that the goal posts were moved here and that it 
had already provided enough information to satisfy any risk of the money going to an 
unintended account. But I have looked at the internal process PayPal follows in these 
circumstances, and Im satisfied Ms Ls estate hasnt been treated any differently to anyone 
else in a similar situation.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask the estate of Ms L 
to accept or reject my decision before 23 December 2023.
