K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc closed his accounts.
background
Mr H had a current account  and savings account  with RBS. It closed the accounts and he 
does not think  that this was fair.
Our investigator did not recommend that the complaint be upheld. He said that RBS had 
given Mr H the required 60 days period of notice  under the terms and conditions  of his 
accounts.
Mr H did not agree and wanted his complaint to be reviewed. He said that there was no 
basis for closure, that he was making  regular payments to his accounts  and that this caused 
him personal  and business inconvenience. RBS had acted unjustly.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
RBS provided me with a copy of its letter to Mr H dated 29 October  2018.  This says that it 
had decided that RBS was no longer going  to provide facilities.  And that Mr H needed  to 
make alternative arrangement within 60 days. 
I appreciate the impact  of this for Mr H. But Im afraid that RBS acted within the terms and 
conditions of the accounts. It was entitled  to decide to close  the accounts having given Mr H 
60 days notice. And it wasnt required to give Mr H a reason. Im afraid that this was its 
commercial decision.  
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 September  2019.
