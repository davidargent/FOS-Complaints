The complaint
Mrs W and the estate of the late Mr W complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited has rejected 
the claims that have been made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Mrs W and the estate 
of the late Mr W are being represented in this complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr and Mrs W had entered into an agreement for a trial membership of a holiday club in 
January 2004. They traded-in their trial membership for some holiday club membership 
points in November 2006. The price of the membership points was £24,919 and the trial 
membership was given a trade-in value of £5,500 so the amount due from them was 
£19,419. Mr and Mrs W entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with a finance provider for 
a loan of that amount and agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £297.48 to the 
finance provider. The loan was transferred to Shawbrook Bank in July 2016 and was repaid 
in July 2017.
Mr and Mrs Ws representative made claims to the finance provider in December 2017 under 
sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act. It said that Mr and Mrs W had a claim for 
misrepresentation against the holiday company for which the finance provider was jointly 
and severally liable and the misrepresentations and practices in the sales presentation made 
the loan agreement unfair. Those claims were forwarded to Shawbrook Bank but it said that 
they were outside of the time limits for a complaint so it was rejected without consideration of 
its merits. Mr and Mrs W werent satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this 
service. Mr W has sadly passed away since then.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Shawbrook Bank was entitled to rely on the timing of the misrepresentation claim to turn it 
down. He said that he hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr and 
Mrs W and the finance provider was unfair and he wasnt persuaded that a court would 
reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He also said that he hadnt seen 
anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs W.
Mrs Ws and the estate of the late Mr Ws representative, on their behalf, has asked for this 
complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. It says, amongst other things, that more 
weight should be put on contractual and legal matters with regards to an unfair relationship 
and it has provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that this complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mrs W and the estate of the late Mr Ws complaint is that Shawbrook Bank turned 
down the claims that had been made to it and I accept that they referred their 
complaint to this service within six years of that happening - but I need to consider 
whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to their claims;
the claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not Shawbrook Banks response to those claims was fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
the claim under section 75 is that the membership was misrepresented to Mr and 
Mrs W and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Shawbrook Bank would be 
expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr and Mrs W could have made a claim to the holiday company or the 
finance provider about the misrepresentations that they say induced them into buying 
the membership in November 2006 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been incurred 
as that was when they also entered into the loan agreement with the finance 
provider;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or the finance provider  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made to the 
finance provider until December 2017, more than eleven years later so was outside 
of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act and I consider that their claim under 
section 75 is now time-barred;
Mrs Ws and the estate of the late Mr Ws representative says that the 
misrepresentations and practices in the sales presentation made the loan agreement 
unfair - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a 
creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Mr and Mrs Ws loan was transferred to Shawbrook Bank in July 2016 and it has 
provided an account statement which shows that the loan was repaid in July 2017  
their claim under section 140A was made in December 2017, less than six years 
later, so I dont consider that their claim under section 140A is time-barred;Mr and Mrs W signed the acquisition agreement, a members declaration, an 
application form for a holiday ownership loan and the loan agreement in November 
2006 and I consider it to be clear from the acquisition agreement that Mr and Mrs W 
were buying a membership of a holiday club;
the members declarations said: We understand that [the holiday company] does not 
and will not run any resale or rental programmes. We understand that the purchase 
of our Membership in [the holiday club] is for the primary purpose of holidays and is 
not an investment in real estate;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs W were told 
that they could divest themselves of the membership points by either selling them or 
renting out the rights that theyd purchased;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership 
points were misrepresented to Mr and Mrs W or that they were induced into entering 
into the acquisition agreement by misrepresentations made by the holiday company;
if Mr and Mrs W considered that the membership points had been misrepresented to 
them, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have contacted the 
holiday company or the finance provider about their concerns sooner that they did  
any misrepresentations would have been made to them in November 2006 but Ive 
seen no evidence to show that they made any misrepresentation claims until 
December 2017  more than eleven years later;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs W were 
unduly pressurised into buying the membership points or entering into the loan 
agreement in November 2006 or that the holiday company used unacceptable sales 
practices against them  Ive seen no evidence to show that they complained to the 
finance provider about those issues until December 2017 (more than eleven years 
after the loan had been made to them) and I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect them to have complained about any such issues before then;
Shawbrook Bank says that Mr and Mrs W made overpayments to their loan account 
of £2,000 in each of March and December 2011 but that no claims were made at 
those times that the loan had been mis-sold to them and the loan was repaid in July 
2017;
Mr and Mrs W signed an application form for a holiday ownership loan in November 
2006 and said that Mr W was employed, they were homeowners and they had an 
annual income of £74,000;
I consider that it would have been reasonable for the finance provider to conclude, on 
the basis of that information, that a loan with monthly repayments of £297.48 was 
affordable for them and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
the loan wasnt affordable for them in November 2006 when it was made to them;
Mrs Ws and the estate of the late Mr Ws representative has provided a generic 
submission from counsel about the holiday company but Im not persuaded that it 
shows that Mr and Mrs Ws relationship with the finance provider was unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Ws 
relationship with the finance provider was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely 
that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and 
Mrs W and the finance provider in these circumstances;
Shawbrook Bank said that Mr and Mrs Ws claims were made outside of the time 
limits for those claims so they were rejected without consideration of their merits so I 
cant say that its response to their claims was fair and reasonable  but if it had properly responded to their claims I consider that it would have been fair and 
reasonable for it not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mrs W for the loss of her husband and the issues that theyve had 
with their membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Shawbrook Bank to refund to Mrs W and the estate 
of the late Mr W any of the money that has been paid under the loan agreement, to 
pay them any compensation or to take any other action in response to this complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ws and the estate of the late Mr Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W and the 
estate of the late Mr W to accept or reject my decision before 18 April 2023.
