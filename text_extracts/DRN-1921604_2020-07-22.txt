The complaint
Mr C has complained that UK Credit Limited irresponsibly lent him a guarantor loan in June 
2017. Mr C has referred the complaint to this service because he disagrees with the 
compensation offer from UK Credit Limited. 
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
UK Credit admits that it shouldnt have given Mr C the loan as he was unable to 
afford it. UK Credit has offered Mr C redress and having considered the offer, I think 
its fair. 
The redress takes into account all payments Mr C made towards the loan and has 
removed all the interest added to the loan. UK Credit has applied the redress to 
offset some of the balance on the loan. I dont think this is unreasonable as Id still 
expect Mr C to repay the capital amount which he has benefited from. 
Having applied the redress to the balance, I can see that theres still an outstanding 
balance. UK Credit should agree a repayment plan with Mr C and ensures it removes 
any adverse information about this loan from Mr Cs credit file. 
As UK Credit has offered to put things right for Mr C in the way thats in line with this 
services recommendation, I wont be asking it to do anymore. 
For these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about UK Credit Limited
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 August 2020.
