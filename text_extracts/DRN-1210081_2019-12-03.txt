complaint
Mr C says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 16 loans Sunny provided to Mr C between December 2014 
and June 2018. I've summarised some of the information Sunny provided about the loans in 
the table below. The first loan was a flexible credit product that allowed multiple drawdowns 
up to a specified credit limit. The remaining 15 loans were all instalments loans. I've noted 
that there was a long gap between loans 1 and 2 and have taken this into account when 
considering the pattern of lending.

Our adjudicator upheld Mr Cs complaint and thought the loans from 7 onwards 
shouldn't have been given. Mr C said he didn't have anything to add to the 
adjudicator's opinion. But Sunny disagreed and as a result the complaint was passed to me. 
I've noted that Sunny already made a fair offer in relation to loans 10 to 16 when it sent Mr C 
its final response letter, although it later amended this to loan 11 onwards in its response to 
our adjudicator. As a result, I don't think loans 1 to 6 or 11 to 16 are still in dispute. So I'll 
focus on the loans still in dispute; that's loans 7 to 10.
 
my findingsI've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We've set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr C could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
As there's been no ongoing dispute about loans 1 to 6, I've not considered whether Sunny 
carried out proportionate checks for these loans. I've looked instead at the overall pattern of 
lending with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have 
seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should 
have realised that it shouldn't have provided any further loans. 
Sunny appears to have accepted such a point did arise during the lending relationship. From 
what it said in response to the adjudicator, it has accepted it lent to Mr C for too long - 
bearing in mind the intended short-term nature of these high-cost loans. So it agreed to 
uphold Mr C's complaint in respect of loan 11 and all subsequent loans.So I think the key issue still in dispute isn't whether the pattern of lending demonstrated Mr C 
was having problems sustainably repaying his loans, but at what point this became 
apparent.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
7. I say this because:
By this point Mr C had been indebted to Sunny for about a year and his 
indebtednesses was not decreasing over time. Mr C appears to have been repaying 
his loans and then shortly after was borrowing again, while 'topping up' his lending by 
taking out multiple consecutive loans. For example, although Mr C repaid loan 5 in 
March 2017, he took out loan 7 just a few days later. From this pattern, I think Sunny 
ought to have realised - from loan 7 - that Mr C's indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
Mr C wasn't making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. For loan 2 to 4, 
which overlapped and were at the start of a chain of lending, he borrowed a total of 
£1,200. Two years later, across loans 13 to 16, Mr C was still borrowing about the 
same amount. Mr C had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period. As I've said above, I think Sunny accepts at least 
some of this, but I think the point at which this became clear was by the time of loan 
7, not loan 11.
 
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr C's indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So I'm upholding Mr C's complaint about loans 7 to 10, as well as those Sunny has already 
offered to uphold, loans 11 to 16.
I understand Sunny's point that the income and expenditure checks (and other checks) it 
carried out suggested Mr C could afford to repay all of the loans. But it's important that the 
loans be sustainably affordable - and I simply don't accept that the checks Sunny carried out 
were always enough to suggest all of Mr C's loans were sustainably affordable. As I've 
explained, I think the pattern of Mr C borrowing for as long as he did, and as much as he did, 
suggests the lending did become unsustainable at the point I've identified.
putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 7 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 7 to 16 should be removed from Mr 
Cs credit file.
 
HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decisionFor the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr C's complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right by taking the steps set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2020.
