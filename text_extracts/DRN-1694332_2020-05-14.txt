The complaint
Mrs T says Canada Square Operations Limited mis-sold her a payment protection insurance 
(PPI) policy. 
What happened
Mrs T bought the policy in 2004 at the same time as taking out a credit card online. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Mrs T disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Ts case.
Ive decided not to uphold Mrs Ts complaint for the following reasons.
The online process used for the sale required Mrs T to select a yes or no box to indicate 
whether she wanted PPI before she could proceed with her credit card application. So, I 
think Canada Square made Mrs T aware that she had a choice about buying the PPI, and 
that she chose to take it. Mrs T doesnt recall agreeing to PPI, but I think thats 
understandable given how long ago it was.
Canada Square didnt recommend the PPI to Mrs T so it didnt have to check if it was right 
for her. 
Its possible the information Canada Square gave Mrs T about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Mrs T was eligible for the policy and doesnt appear to have been 
affected by any of the main things the policy didnt cover. Based on what I know about her 
circumstances it looks like the policy couldve been useful to her. So, I dont think better 
information wouldve stopped her buying it. 
Ive taken into account Mrs Ts comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 June 2020.
