The complaint
Mr T complains that the mileage of a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase 
agreement with Mi Vehicle Finance Limited, trading as Mann Island, was incorrect.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr T under a hire purchase agreement with Mann Island 
that he signed in March 2017 and the car's mileage at that time was 34,186 miles;
he had some issues with the car and voluntarily terminated the agreement but he 
says that he became aware that the car's mileage was incorrect so he complained to 
Mann Island - he says that he had to pay for repairs to the car and he's lost his 
deposit;
it said that it looked like an error was made in the car's mileage that was recorded 
in January 2016 but that Mr T had arranged for it be corrected and it provided him 
with a copy of the checks that it had made before the car was supplied to him;
it also said that the car's MOT test records show the car's mileage as follows: 
January 2015 - 18,560, December 2015 - 26,303, November 2016 - 32,928, March 
2017 - 34,207, March 2018 - 44,942 and March 2019 - 59,422;
I consider it to be more likely than not than the incorrect mileage for the car was 
recorded in January 2016 in error (which has been corrected) and I'm not persuaded 
that there's enough evidence to show that the car's mileage was incorrect when the 
car was supplied to Mr T;
nor am I persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that Mann Island was 
required to make more checks about the car's mileage before the car was supplied to 
Mr T - and I don't consider that the car was mis-sold to Mr T or that Mann Island has 
acted incorrectly concerning the car's mileage; and
I find that it wouldn't be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Mann Island to reimburse Mr T for any of the repair costs, to refund to him any of the 
deposit that he paid or to take any other action in response to his complaint. 
 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I don't uphold Mr T's complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or reject my decision before 7 July 2020.
