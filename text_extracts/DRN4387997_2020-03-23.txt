K821x#15complaint
Mr R says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr R has told us his credit reports would  have  shown  he had a poor credit history  
and he had to re-borrow because of the loans. He wants  the interest and charges incurred 
repaid to him, plus statutory interest, and any negative  information on his credit file to be 
removed.

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Rs complaint and thought  loan four shouldnt have been 
given in the first chain  of lending and then the loans from loan ten onwards in the second 
chain. 
Sunny initially disagreed  but later reconsidered Mr Rs complaint and agreed with the 
adjudicators assessment  and made  an offer.
The offer was put to Mr R but he didn't accept it because of the amount of loans taken out 
and the interest  he had been charged. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
Ref: DRN43879972consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr R didnt accept the offer Sunny  had made  in response to the adjudicators assessment 
which was to uphold  loans four and then loans ten to 12. Mr R said he wouldnt accept the 
offer because of the interest he was charged and the amount  of loans taken out. 
As explained above, at the beginning of a borrowing relationship its not unreasonable for 
less thorough checks to be made about  a consumers  financial circumstances. Short-term 
lending is meant  to be quick and easy to access  say in a financial emergency   but in 
return it is an expensive way to borrow. So that is why the longer someone may borrow from 
a business, more thorough and proportionate  checks would be expected,  to make sure the 
consumer was using  short-term lending as it was intended for.
When our adjudicator assessed  Mr Rs complaint they concluded, for the first chain of 
lending, that by loan four it would have expected  Sunny  to have considered  whether it was 
reasonable for it to have carried on lending to Mr R. This was because  at that time he 
already had three outstanding loans  with Sunny and so may not have been  managing his 
money. I think  this was a reasonable  conclusion  to have reached, bearing  in mind the 
particular circumstances  of this complaint and my above comments.
Ref: DRN43879973And the adjudicator further concluded  that for the second chain of lending, the loans from 
loan ten shouldnt have been given as there was an indication that Mr R was becoming 
persistently reliant  upon short-term lending. So not using short-term lending  as it was 
intended to be used. Again, I agree with the outcome reached by the adjudicator. And Sunny  
has offered to put things right in line with the adjudicators suggestion.  
Sunnys offer includes  a repayment  of the interest Mr R paid on the upheld loans as well as 
any additional charges. Its also offered to pay 8% interest for the time Mr R was out of 
pocket because of those interest and charges. This offer is in line with what we would expect 
a business to do to put matters right when  putting  a customer back  in the position they would 
have been but for the inappropriate lending.
Mr R was also concerned  about  his credit  file containing negative  information. The 
adjudicator said that any negative  information about  loan four should be removed  and that all 
information about loans ten onwards  should  be removed. So Mr Rs credit file will reflect  the 
earlier loans  where  the lending wasnt unreasonable but any negative information for the 
uphold loans  should be removed and nothing about  loans ten onwards should  remain  on his 
credit file. 
So while I appreciate Mr Rs comments Im not upholding  his complaint any more  than the 
adjudicator because of what I have said above.  And I do hope I have addressed  Mr Rs 
points and explained the reasons for coming  to the outcome  that has been reached.  For 
completeness I will reiterate how Sunny should put things right.  
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loan four and loan ten onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan four from Mr Rs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan ten onwards  means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans ten to twelve should be removed 
from Mr Rs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr R a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 April 2020.
