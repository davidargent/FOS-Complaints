The complaint 
Miss Ms complaint is about misrepresentation of car finance by PSA Finance UK Limited.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
text messages demonstrate that Miss M didnt contact the dealership until June 2018 
to ask about handing the car back. That was six months after shed taken receipt of 
the car. I think she would have enquired as soon as she had collected it if insurance 
was a problem as she would have needed to insure the car straight away;
Miss Ms driving license only allowed her to drive an automatic vehicle. So regardless 
of whether it could be insured it could clearly not legally be driven by Miss M. I think 
its reasonable to suggest she would have been aware of this before she took 
ownership of the vehicle. If not being able to drive the vehicle wasnt important to 
Miss M I think insuring the car would not have been a significant consideration either. 
Miss M has confirmed that another member of the family is paying for the car and 
that the V5 is now in their name. It seems likely therefore that that was always the 
intention.
For these reasons, I dont think there has been a misrepresentation here and I do not uphold 
this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about PSA Finance UK Limited. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 July 2020.
