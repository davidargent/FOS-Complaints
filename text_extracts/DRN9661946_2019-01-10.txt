K820x#14complaint
Mr Us complaint is about a mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) policy sold to him 
by Barclays Bank UK Plc in 2008.  Mr U is unhappy with the level of compensation he has 
been offered.
background
Between 2002 and 2008 Mr U took out four loans with Barclays. The first three  loans were  
taken out without PPI.
When Mr U took out the final loan in September 2008 he was sold a PPI policy. 
Around 2010 Mr U made  a claim on the policy and received a total of £2,074.94  from the 
insurer.
In 2015 Mr U complained  about the sale of the policy. Barclays agreed the PPI was mis-sold.
Barclays said the total PPI premium  was £1,070.53 which had been added  to the loan. 
And Mr U had also paid additional  interest because of the PPI. This additional interest was 
£373.69. 
Normally these amounts  would be refunded to Mr U. But Barclays said that it would deduct  
the amount of £2,074.94  from the refund as Mr U had already received this amount when he 
made a claim on the policy in 2010.  
But Barclays  said it would pay Mr U £237.98  which was compensatory interest  for the time 
Mr U had been out of pocket.
Mr U didnt accept Barclays offer so the £237.98  was never  paid to Mr U.
In 2018 Barclays  conducted a review  of the complaint. This time Barclays  said that as the 
claim amount exceeded the compensation it wouldnt be making Mr U any offer.
Barclays also said that Mr U had defaulted  on the loan and the outstanding  balance  was now 
£8,894.62.
Our adjudicator looked at the complaint and thought  Barclays  had acted fairly. Mr U didnt 
agree with the adjudicators findings so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  the sale of PPI on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding 
this case. 
I think Barclays has acted fairly and Ill explain why.
Where a consumer has made  a successful claim under a PPI policy,  and its later found that 
the PPI was mis-sold, Id usually consider it fair for the business to deduct the value of that 
claim from the consumers compensation. 
Ref: DRN96619462This is because Id expect  the business to put the consumer  in the position they would have  
been if they had taken  out the loan without the PPI policy. In this case that means  Mr U 
wouldnt have been able to claim on the policy, and wouldnt have received the benefit from 
it if it hadnt been sold to him. 
So I think its fair for Barclays to deduct  the value  of the claim made during the course  of the 
policy from the compensation. And in Mr Us case the value of the claim he received in 2010 
(£2,074.94) exceeds the total value of the compensation. 
I realise that in 2015 Barclays originally offered to pay Mr U £237.98. This was the part of the 
redress intended to compensate Mr U for being  out of pocket. But Mr U didnt accept that 
offer and when Barclays reviewed the case in 2018  it didnt  repeat  the offer. Ive thought 
about this and I dont think itd be fair for me to direct Barclays  to pay that amount to Mr U 
now. Thats  because Mr U received more from the claim  in 2010 than he ever paid for the 
PPI, so I dont think he was out of pocket because of the PPI.
my final decision
My final decision is that Barclays Bank  UK Plc has acted fairly in deducting  the money Mr U 
received for a claim  in 2010 from the compensation for the PPI he was 
mis-sold in 2008. So I dont make any further award  against Barclays  Bank UK Plc.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr U to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 February  2019.
