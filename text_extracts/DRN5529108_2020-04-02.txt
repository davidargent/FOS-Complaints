K821x#15complaint
Miss K has complained  about  a number of loans she took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Miss K says she was lent 
to irresponsibly and the loans caused her financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Miss K took out 13 instalment  loans from Sunny between November 2017 
and October 2018.  Ive enclosed a summary of Miss Ks borrowing with Sunny, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
for loans  3 -13. Sunny said it didnt agree, so Ive been asked  to make a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice, on our website. Ive followed this approach when  thinking  about Miss Ks 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Miss K 
could repay  all the loans she was given  in a sustainable manner. These  checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss K could sustainably repay the loans;  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Ref: DRN55291082Of course,  the loans  being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Miss K could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Miss K including assessing  her income,  expenditure and creditworthiness. It says all this 
information showed that she would  be able to make the loan repayments  she was 
committing to. Ive thought about this and also looked at the overall pattern of lending  history 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans to Miss K. 
Ive taken account of what  Ive said above,  about the length of the lending relationship, and 
applied it to the circumstances of loans  1 and 2 in this case. And I dont think its clear 
enough that what Sunny would have would have  seen,  from its checks,  suggested loans 1 or 
2 were unaffordable for Miss K. I accept that Miss K may have already been finding 
managing money  quite  difficult  at this point. However, theres no clear  record that the type or 
depth of credit checks that were carried out at that time would have exposed these issues.  
So Im afraid  I dont agree that Sunny  knew its lending was unsustainable. I therefore  dont 
uphold this part of the complaint.
However, I think from the point of loan number 3, the situation was different. Miss K applied 
for this loan whilst  loan 2 was still outstanding  and this pushed up her overall monthly  
repayments quite  a bit. I note that Miss Ks income was relatively  low and therefore  she was 
in a vulnerable  financial  situation.  I also note the self-declared expenditure details Sunny had 
on file for her seemed  somewhat unusually in my experience - to fluctuate  substantially 
over the 3 loan applications shed made thus far. Clearly this would have been highly 
relevant to her ability to repay the lending. 
So overall, I think all these factors should  have combined to show Miss Ks financial situation 
demanded much greater  scrutiny and clarification. In short,  Sunny ought  to have carried  out 
more comprehensive  checks  to ensure the lending was sustainable  from this point. Had it 
carried out more  comprehensive checks, these would have easily  revealed  that Miss K was 
in fact experiencing difficulties in managing money.  As well as her outstanding Sunny  loan,  
she had other short-term lending outstanding with other companies, meaning  that she was 
elsewhere indebted and having to use borrowed money to pay other  loans off.
Our experience of short-term lending tells us that consumers who have difficulty  managing 
their money are less likely to be able to sustainably repay a loan.  More  thorough  and 
proportionate financial checks  at this point would  have clearly shown that Miss K had little 
room for manoeuvre and so I think it was wrong to lend to her from loan 3 onwards.
In addition to the above,  from the point of loan 6 onwards,  there was also a clear  pattern of 
repeated lending evident in my view. Again, loan 6 was advanced  to her whilst another loan 
remained outstanding  and there  was an obvious dependency on high-interest, short-term  
lending evidenced  by this, her sixth loan in 6 months. So Im also upholding Miss Ks 
Ref: DRN55291083complaint in respect of loans 6 - 13 because Sunny repeatedly lent to Miss K in an 
unsustainable manner  because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Miss K borrowed was likely to have had negative  
implications on her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right
In order to put things  right for Miss K, Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges Miss K paid on loans 3 - 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Miss Ks credit  file in relation to loan 3 - 
5.
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 - 13 should be completely 
removed from Miss Rs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Miss K a certificate  
showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I partially uphold  Miss Ks complaint and direct Elevate Credit  International Limited to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 May 2020.
