The complaint
Miss B complains that J D Williams & Company Limited trading as Simply Be irresponsibly 
increased the credit limit on her mail order account so she couldnt afford the repayments. 
She also complains about the way it dealt with her account after she complained
What happened
Simply Be provided Miss B with a mail order credit account on 4 June 2016. The initial credit 
limit was £125. This was then increased/decreased as follows:
28/08/2016  £125 - £200
18/05/2017  £200- 0
04/08/2017  £0 - £200
26/08/2017  £200 - £300
23/09/2017  £300 - £500
21/10/2017  £500 - £800
18/11/2017  £800 - £1,200
10/02/2018  £1,200 - £1,500 
Miss B struggled to keep up with the card payments and complained in February 2021 that 
the card increases had been unaffordable for her and that it had put her into further debt. 
Simply Be said that it provided credit in instalments. It assessed that Miss B could be 
provided with a credit limit of up to £1,500, but initially decided that a £125 limit was 
appropriate. It increased this to £200 in August 2016. After Miss B missed three payments, it 
reduced the limit to £0 in May 2017. At Miss Bs request it reinstated the £200 limit in 
August 2017. The limit was then increased several times until February 2018 when it 
reached £1,500. Simply Be initially said that all the increases were applied using several 
sources of information, which included information provided by a Credit Reference Agency. 
So it said that the increases were responsibly applied.
Subsequently Miss B referred her complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service in 
July 2021. Whilst the complaint was still being dealt with, Simply Be sold the debt to a third 
party (L) in February 2022. Miss B complained about this, and L arranged for the debt to be 
sold back to Simply Be, as it had been informed the debt wasnt in dispute. 
Miss B then received a letter from another third party company (C) concerning a different 
account debt which had been sold to that company in 2012. This caused some confusion, 
but the result was that it prompted Simply Be to review this matter again. It decided to 
uphold Miss Bs complaint regarding the credit limit increase in August 2017. This was on 
the basis that the increase had been applied when the account had been in arrears for 
consecutive months in the months prior. Because of this, it said that it was evident this 
credit limit increase was not in Miss Bs best interests. It refunded the interest and 
administration charges applied on the account from that date. This effectively meant that the 
whole balance on the account at that time, £1,454.12 was paid out to Miss B, together with a 
further £68.78.
Miss B didnt accept that that resolved the matter, pointing out that she had been making 
regular payments towards the balance. She was also unhappy at the way Simply Be had 
acted in respect of selling the debt to L and with her being chased by C with regard to the 
other account which had long since been statute-barred. Her complaint against C has been 
dealt with separately.
I issued a provisional decision. In it I said that Simply Be should rework the account so that 
the increases after the original reinstatement of the credit limit should only be applied from 
September 2017. It also said it should pay Miss B £100 compensation for the way it had 
dealt with the account after the complaint.
Both parties accepted my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My provisional findings are set out below in italics:
Considering the relevant rules, guidance, and good industry practice, I think the questions I 
need to consider in deciding whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this 
complaint are:
Did Simply Be complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Miss B 
would be able to repay the credit advanced in a sustainable way?
If not, would those checks have shown that Miss B would have been able to do so?
Bearing in mind the circumstances at the time of each application, was there a point 
where Simply Be ought reasonably to have realised it was increasing Miss Bs 
indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful and so shouldnt 
have provided further credit?
credit limit increases
Simply Be has explained that the account was effectively designed to provide gradual 
increases in the credit limit so long as it remained well maintained, and Miss Bs external 
credit score was satisfactory. The account history shows the account was regularly reviewed 
and if eligible an increase was applied. However in this case Miss Bs account wasnt well 
maintained in that she missed three payments in March, April, and May 2017. Simply Be 
recognised this when it upheld Miss Bs complaint on the basis that it shouldnt have 
increased the credit limit when the account had been increased for consecutive months.
I havent seen any of Simply Bes guidelines concerning when it will increase/ reinstate the 
credit limit when the account has been in arrears e.g. how many months is it appropriate to 
wait before increasing the limit again. Simply Be has provided to us a copy of a credit report 
on Miss B dated March 2021. It does show historic balances on Miss Bs accounts. She 
missed the three payments referred to, but then kept the account in good order until at least February 2021. It also appears that during this period she kept her other accounts in good 
order.
I think that Simply Be shouldnt have reinstated the credit limit when it did, on the basis that it 
has already accepted that it shouldnt have been increased in August 2018. I think Simply Be 
fairly increased the limit after that, from September 2017. This does however have a knock-
on effect in that the limit should only have been reinstated in September 2017. This means 
that the credit limit should have been increased as follows:
23/09/2017 0 - £200
21/10/2017 £200 - £300
18/11/2017 £300 - £500
10/02/2018 £500 - £800
Simply Be has already provided a refund. I am planning to direct that it should recalculate 
that and if the balance exceeded the new credit limits as set out above refund any interest 
and charges applied above those limits.
dealings with the account after the complaint
Simply Be clearly shouldnt have sold the account to L in February 2022. L made it clear to 
Miss B that the account was sold to it on the basis that there wasnt any dispute over it. I 
note that L did pay Miss B £50 in respect of this. However the effect of this was that Miss B 
has been caused additional anxiety and inconvenience  she found her account was closed 
down and had nowhere to pay the payments she had been making.
I also think that Simply Bes belated review of the matter after which it agreed that the credit 
limit increase applied in August 2017 was irresponsible delayed the matter further.
I am planning to direct that it pay Miss B compensation of £100.
dealings with C
It appears that C contacted Miss B out of the blue. This related to another account, and 
though I can see it caused some confusion I cant see that Simply Be was responsible for 
this. I note in any event the complaint about C has been dealt with separately. I am planning 
not to uphold this part of the complaint.
As both parties have accepted my provisional findings, those findings are now final and form 
part of this final decision.
Putting things right
As I dont think Simply Be should have increased Miss Bs credit limit above the limits Ive 
set out above, namely £300 in October 2017, £500 in November 2017 and £800 in February 
2018, I dont think its fair for it to charge any interest or charges on any balances which 
exceeded those limits at the relevant time. However, Miss B has had the benefit of all the 
money she spent on the account so I think she should pay this back. Therefore, Simply Be 
should take the following actions:
Rework the account removing all interest and charges that have been applied to the 
above balances. If the rework results in a credit balance, taking into account the refund already made, this 
should be refunded to Miss B along with 8% simple interest per year* calculated from the 
date of each overpayment to the date of settlement. Simply Be should also remove all 
adverse information recorded after 10 February 2018 regarding this account from 
Miss Bs credit file. 
If Simply Be has sold the debt to a third party, it should arrange to either buy back the 
debt from the third party or liaise with them to ensure the redress set out above is carried 
out promptly.
Simply Be should also pay Miss B £100 compensation for the anxiety and inconvenience 
caused.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Simply Be to deduct tax from any award of interest. 
It must give Miss B a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if he/she asks for 
one. If it intends to apply the refund to reduce an outstanding balance, it must do so after 
deducting the tax.
My final decision
I uphold the complaint and require J D Williams & Company Limited trading as Simply Be to 
provide the remedy set out under Putting things right above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 January 2023.
