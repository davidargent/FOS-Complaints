The complaint
Mr W complains about the way he was spoken to by one of Hastings Insurance Services 
Limiteds advisers.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute so I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Hastings has said theyre unable to locate the call Mr W complained about. Ive seen 
evidence of the search they carried out with the number Mr W said he called from, 
and Im satisfied the call in question couldnt be located.
When looking into Mr Ws concerns, a manger at Hastings referred Mr W to call they 
could locate and didnt think their adviser had been rude or unprofessional. Ive 
listened to the call in which the manager discussed this with Mr W and heard Mr W 
agree that he didnt have a problem with the call that had been located.
As Mr W hasnt provided any other numbers he may have called from, or any other 
evidence to support what happened in the call hes complained about, I cant fairly 
say Hastings did anything wrong.
Mr W has also complained about the way Hastings handled his complaint. However, 
complaint handling isnt an activity our service has the power to investigate, so 
I cannot make a finding on that issue.
For these reasons, although I understand this isnt the outcome Mr W hoped for, I do not 
uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about Hastings Insurance Services 
Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 December 2020.
