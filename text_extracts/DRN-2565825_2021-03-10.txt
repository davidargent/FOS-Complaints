The complaint
Mr I complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) handled his claim for a refund 
poorly.
What happened
In August 2020, Mr I bought a wardrobe online from a major retailer for £3649. When it 
arrived, it wasnt as described on its website. Mr I complained to the retailer but also asked 
PayPal for a refund. PayPal asked for evidence of the problems with the wardrobe. Mr I got 
this and sent it to PayPal. PayPal rejected the claim. The retailer part-refunded £3250 in 
November 2020.
Mr I complained. The wardrobe was a different colour, had door handles missing or 
misaligned. He said that PayPal told him on the phone that he needed to get a letter from a 
third-party furniture expert confirming that the wardrobe wasnt as described. He got this and 
sent it to PayPal  it cost £150. PayPal rejected it as they said it didnt have a company logo 
on the document. Then they said theyd rejected the claim as it wasnt provided by an expert. 
So, Mr I complained hed been misinformed about the claim.
PayPal said theyd rejected Mr Is claim as the appraisal was from a mirror shop  not 
qualified in the area of wardrobes. They couldnt be expected to call third parties on every 
claim they received. They couldnt provide the call with Mr I. But they accepted that Mr I was 
misinformed on the phone  that the claim was rejected because it wasnt on notepaper with 
a logo. They paid compensation of £150  the cost of the appraisal.
Mr I brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator said that the problem had arisen 
because PayPal told Mr I that the claim was rejected because the appraisal didnt have a 
logo on it  and then said it was because it wasnt from an expert. While Mr I had got a 
refund from the retailer, PayPal had no hand in that. Our investigator had spoken to the 
business which provided the appraisal and was happy that they were qualified to do this. So, 
PayPal shouldve accepted it  or done more to check its validity. So, they hadnt dealt with 
Mr Is request for a refund properly. He said a further amount of compensation of £100 
should be paid  in addition to the £150 already paid.
PayPal didnt agree and asked that the complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr I got a partial refund of £3250 from the retailer  but he had to go to court to get that, 
which wouldve involved a lot of time. He says that PayPal shouldve met the claim anyway  
as he had done what theyd asked  which was to get a third-party expert appraisal. He was 
then told it wasnt accepted because it didnt have a logo on it. But PayPal then said it was 
because it wasnt from an expert.
PayPal have established processes for these claims. Their terms and condition say You 
need to get a document (such as an estimate or invoice) from an unbiased or organisation
that is qualified in the area of the item in question (other than you). This document should 
detail the extent of the damage or clearly explain how the item received
significantly differs from the item advertised.
But  they also say that they have sole discretion in deciding on claims: PayPal determines, 
in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for PayPal Buyer Protection. PayPal's 
original determination is considered final, but you may be able to file an appeal of the 
decision with PayPal if you have new or compelling information not available at the time of 
the original determination or you believe there was an error in the decision-making process. 
So  I must decide whether PayPal acted fairly in dealing with Mr Is claim.
PayPal rejected the claim  and told Mr I it was because there wasnt a logo on the 
document provided. They then said it was because it wasnt written by an expert. Ive seen 
the evidence  its a handwritten note on headed paper but does appear to be by someone 
specialising in mirrors  not wardrobes. So, I can see why PayPal questioned it. But  as our 
investigator said, PayPal shouldve tried harder to validate it. Hed called the business and 
was easily able to come to the view that they restored and sold furniture  and their view 
was therefore genuine. PayPal say they dont have the time to make these calls.
Mr I had to take time off work to sort the matter out  when PayPal couldve easily validated 
the third-party evidence  and seen that he had a case for a refund. I can see that PayPal 
has already reimbursed Mr I for the cost of the appraisal (£150). But, in view of the distress 
and inconvenience caused to Mr I, they should pay a further £100.
Putting things right
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should pay Mr I £100 for distress and inconvenience.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. 
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should pay Mr I £100  this is in addition to the £150 already 
paid.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 April 2021.
