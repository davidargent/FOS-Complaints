DRN-2439601
The complaint
Mr D complains that ActiveQuote Limited failed to accurately pass on details about his 
medical conditions when selling his income protection policy.
What happened
Mr D took out an income protection policy through ActiveQuote in 2019. During that process 
ActiveQuote asked Mr D a number of questions, many of which related to his medical 
history, and it passed information about Mr Ds answers over to the policys underwriter. 
Mr D claimed on his policy in 2020. But his claim was declined by the underwriter on the 
basis that hed failed to disclose a history of ptosis (an eye condition in which the upper 
eyelid droops) and asthma. 
Mr D complained about the declined claim, and this service considered that matter against 
the underwriter. Mr D also complained about the role ActiveQuote had played, and said it 
had initially failed to pass accurate information over to the underwriter.
ActiveQuote looked into Mr Ds concerns and said the answers it had given the underwriter 
were the answers Mr D had provided. So, as Mr D remained unhappy with its position, he 
referred his complaint about ActiveQuote to this service. 
On first review our investigator didnt think ActiveQuote had done anything wrong in the way 
it had reported information about Mr Ds medical history. But after further consideration their 
opinion changed. 
Our investigator explained they were satisfied that Mr D had disclosed both his ptosis and 
asthma to ActiveQuote. They said ActiveQuote hadnt passed that information to the 
underwriter, and in view of the impact that had on Mr D recommended ActiveQuote paid 
£200 in compensation. 
Mr D agreed with our investigators opinion, but said more compensation was warranted. 
ActiveQuote disagreed with our investigators opinion and said Mr Ds claim wasnt declined 
as result of its actions so compensation wasnt warranted. It also asked for the complaint to 
be referred to an ombudsman. 
As no agreement between the parties was reached, the matter is now for me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have reached the same outcome as our investigator and for largely the 
same reasons. Ill explain why. 
I have listened to the available call recordings in this complaint and I am aware that when 
taking Mr D through questions about his medical history, ActiveQuote asked the following:
Apart from anything you have already told us about in this application, during the last five 
years have you seen a health professional for any condition affecting the eyes or vision, not 
wholly corrected by spectacles, lenses or laser treatment, for example cataract or 
blindness?
Mr D said no at first. But shortly afterwards he provided additional information and said: 
About the eyes, again I did but that was for a droopy eyelid that was cosmetic and I didnt 
go through with it anyway. 
ActiveQuote responded with thats fine, but it didnt ask any follow up questions about the 
eye condition that had just been disclosed and as a result no further information about it or 
its history was gathered. However, when ActiveQuote went on to provide information to the 
underwriter, it reported Mr Ds answer to the eye/vision question as no. In view of the 
above, I dont think that was an accurate reflection of matters, because an eye condition had 
been disclosed.
ActiveQuote has said it didnt report the eye condition because Mr D had advised it was 
cosmetic. But Mr D had disclosed another condition which hed also said was cosmetic 
during the call too  a skin condition. ActiveQuote had asked follow-up questions about the 
skin condition during the call. And it had also referred information about it on to the 
underwriter. So Im not persuaded that ActiveQuotes reason for not disclosing the eye 
condition supports its position.
I think the reason additional information about Mr Ds eye condition wasnt gathered was 
because ActiveQuote didnt ask any follow up questions about it. And I think the reason 
information about the condition did not reach the underwriter was because ActiveQuote did 
not pass it on. 
During the call and in response to a question about asthma and diabetes, Mr D also told 
ActiveQuote that he suffered from asthma. He explained he experienced his asthma 
because of hay fever. And in response to this information ActiveQuote said, yeah thats fine, 
no problem at all.
Mr D didnt refer to his asthma again, specifically in response to a later question about 
asthma during a health and lifestyle questionnaire. But given ActiveQuote had previously 
indicated Mr Ds asthma was fine and not a problem, I can appreciate why Mr D may not 
have thought it necessary to refer to it once again. 
ActiveQuote did not make the underwriter aware of Mr Ds earlier reference to asthma either. 
And again, I dont think that was an accurate reflection of the information Mr D had actually 
provided it with. 
So, for the reasons given above, I too agree that ActiveQuote failed to provide accurate 
information to the underwriter. And I am of the opinion that ActiveQuote need to recognise 
the impact its actions had on Mr D by way of compensation. 
Before I set out my findings on compensation, I want to highlight that any award I make will 
only reflect the impact of ActiveQuotes actions. Mr D has set out the impact that the entire 
situation had on him and I appreciate what he has said in relation to this. But I have not 
considered matters relating to the actions of the underwriter, or the potential impact of those 
on Mr D, because that has been considered by this service under a separate complaint.It is clear from reviewing this complaint that it was both distressing and upsetting for Mr D to 
be told he had failed to disclose conditions which he knew he had made ActiveQuote aware 
of. And having taken this into account, I think £200 represents a fair and proportionate 
reflection of the impact this had on Mr D. 
I realise that neither party is in agreement with this amount, but I hope that both Mr D and 
ActiveQuote can appreciate why I have reached this position.
Putting things right
For the reasons given above, ActiveQuote must put things right by paying Mr D £200 in 
compensation.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. ActiveQuote Limited must put things right in 
the way I have set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 September 2021.
