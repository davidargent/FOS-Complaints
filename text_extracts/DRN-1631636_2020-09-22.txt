The complaint
M Ltd, represented by Mr M, complained because National Westminster Bank Plc refused to 
renew its overdraft.
What happened
M Ltd had a £5,000 business overdraft facility. It was agreed for 12 months and was due to 
expire on 1 December 2019. 
NatWest tried to contact Mr M on 11 November 2019, but he said it wasnt a convenient 
time. Mr M asked for a call back the next day at 11am, but NatWest didnt ring at the agreed 
time. NatWest tried again to ring on 28 November but didnt get an answer, so it sent a text 
asking Mr M to ring.
Mr M and NatWest spoke on 2 December. Mr M told the bank that it had been a difficult year 
for M Ltd. Mr M had another business account with NatWest and he said that this other 
business had a good turnover. Mr M asked NatWest to renew M Ltds overdraft, taking into 
account the fact hed been a customer for a long time, and his other business.
But NatWest said it needed to base its decision about M Ltds overdraft on the turnover of M 
Ltd itself. NatWest asked for M Ltds accounts, so it could review options. It said it would give 
Mr M two weeks to provide them. NatWest said that M Ltds current turnover didnt justify an 
overdraft. Mr M said the accounts would show it was loss-making. So NatWest asked for 
projections, but Mr M said he couldnt predict the future. He wanted NatWest to take into 
account his other business, and he complained.
In its final response, NatWest said that it was sorry it hadnt phoned Mr M back on 12 
November, and it gave £50 compensation. But it said that overdrafts were designed to help 
cash flow by providing short term borrowing which was occasionally needed to meet large 
bills that couldnt be met from turnover. Such borrowing would normally be repaid by the 
steady flow of cash coming into the business. But in the case of M Ltd, the overdraft had 
become a persistent debt which wasnt being repaid. M Ltds account had been referred to 
NatWests specialised business team in November 2019, and the bank urged Mr M to get in 
touch and provide M Ltds financial information, so they could discuss a way forward.
Mr M wasnt satisfied and complained to this service.
The investigator didnt uphold M Ltds complaint. She looked at the account terms and 
conditions, which showed that NatWest had the authority to withdraw the overdraft facility. 
And she noted that NatWest had given more time to provide financial information so it could 
look at options. She said that if M Ltd couldnt repay the outstanding balance, NatWest had 
said it could carry out an affordability assessment to work out a plan, which showed it was 
willing to help.
M Ltd, represented by Mr M, didnt agree. He asked for an ombudsman decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The terms and conditions of M Ltds account give NatWest the power to stop providing an 
overdraft. 
 5.3 Limiting the use of your account or our services
We may suspend, restrict or stop access to your account or to certain services
(such as your card or online banking) 
.
as a result of a change in the way you operate your account or in your financial 
circumstances,
If we reasonably believe that you may have difficulty in meeting your commitments;
Well usually tell you before or immediately after we take any of these steps. Well also 
explain our reasons for doing so.

10.1 Arranged overdrafts
Arranged overdrafts are available on request on the Business Current Account, the Business 
Currency Current Account and the Business Currency Extra Account if you satisfy our 
lending criteria.
Ive considered what happened in the light of these clauses.
Its not disputed the M Ltds financial circumstances had changed. The turnover was low at 
£4797, which was less than previous years.  
I find that NatWest did inform M Ltd before it withdrew the overdraft, as the terms and 
conditions indicate. I appreciate that NatWest didnt make a promised call-back on 12 
November, for which it paid £50 which I consider was fair. But there were other 
conversations. And I understand that NatWest put the account on hold for the time of M Ltds 
complaint to this service, so in fact M Ltd has had quite a while since its overdraft was due to 
expire on 1 December 2019.
And looking at the clause about arranged overdrafts, M Ltd didnt satisfy NatWests lending 
criteria. I note, for instance, that the latest annual turnover figure of £4797 was lower than 
the £5,000 overdraft. And although NatWest asked Mr M to provide accounts, or a 
projection, he didnt do so. Without any such information  for example giving clear reasons 
why the financial situation would improve  there was no basis for NatWest to see the 
situation improving. 
So I find that NatWest had the authority, through the terms and conditions, to stop providing 
an overdraft to M Ltd. And I find that its fair and reasonable that the decision about whether 
to lend to M Ltd was taken on the profitability or otherwise of M Ltd. NatWest didnt have to 
take Mr Ms other business into account.
This meant that the amount M Ltd owed became repayable. I can see that NatWest was, 
and remains, willing to discuss how M Ltd can repay what it owes. Its also urged him to 
provide financial information so it could discuss a suitable way forward. So I find that 
NatWest acted fairly and reasonably.My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 October 2020.
