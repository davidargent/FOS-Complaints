The complaint
Mr L has complained about loans granted to him by Elevate Credit International Limited 
trading as Sunny (Sunny or the lender). He says the loans were unaffordable and should 
not have been agreed.
Mr L has used a claims management company to bring his complaint to this Service but, for 
simplicity, I will refer to Mr L throughout this decision.
What happened
Sunny agreed 27 loans for Mr L from August 2017 to March 2019. The loans were all 
instalment loans to be repaid over six months and ranged in value from £50 to £400. The 
below table sets out some of the information Sunny has provided about these loans (with 
numbers rounded to the nearest pound). As the table shows many of the loans ran 
concurrently and all were repaid.

Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ls complaint in part and recommended that Sunny refund all of 
the interest and charges he paid on loans 6 to 27. They said that by loan 6 it should have 
been clear to Sunny that Mr L was having problems managing his money and that by loan 
13 the pattern of lending itself clearly showed that this was the case. 
Sunny disagreed with this recommendation but offered to refund interest and charges on 
loans 23 to 27 because, it said when looking at Mr. [L]s usage overall, we recognise that 
we couldve asked him further questions about the manner in which he used our product. At 
the point after which the twenty-second loan was granted, it may have been prudent for us to 
contact Mr. [L] to discuss his financial circumstances and how he was using our product, 
given that there had been fluctuations in credit expenditure around this time.
Mr L didnt accept this offer and so the complaint came to me, as an ombudsman, to resolve. 
I issued my provisional decision on 22 May 2020 explaining why I was thinking of coming to 
a different view of Mr Ls complaint - I provisionally found that Sunny had been irresponsible 
when it agreed to loans 13 onwards but didnt uphold Mr Ls complaint about his earlier 
loans.
Mr L has accepted my provisional findings and I have had no response from Sunny. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As before, I have also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good 
industry practice at the time. As neither party has provided any comment or new information 
in response, I see no need to depart from my provisional conclusions but for completeness I 
will set them out here again.  
The Financial Conduct Authority was the regulator when Mr L took out his loans. The 
relevant rules and guidance set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook said that for all loans 
Sunny needed to check that Mr L could afford to meet his repayments in a sustainable 
manner. This meant Mr L being able to meet his repayments out of his normal income 
without having to go without or borrow further.
The regulations werent prescriptive about what checks Sunny needed to carry out in 
order to reasonably assess whether or not Mr L would be able to meet his repayments 
sustainably. But the regulations said that such checks needed to be proportionate. This suggests that the same checks might not be the appropriate thing to do for all consumers, or 
for the same consumer in all circumstances.
In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed checks
    the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
    the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income);
    the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny says it asked Mr L for information about his income and expenses each time he 
applied for a loan. The lender recorded Mr Ls monthly income as £1,245 when he first 
applied, which increased to £1,800 for loan 11 onwards. It recorded Mr Ls monthly 
expenses as ranging from approximately £134 to £674, which left him with a minimum 
monthly amount of about £660 to meet his loan repayments over the time he borrowed from 
Sunny.
Sunny also said that it used information from third party credit reference agencies to ensure 
the loans were affordable for Mr L and to check his credit history, though it hasnt provided 
the results of these checks.
Mr L took out his first two loans in August 2017 and the combined monthly repayments came 
to less than £140. He repaid both within the month. The income and expenditure information 
Sunny gathered suggests that Mr L would be able to afford these loans and, given it was 
early in their lending relationship, I think the checks Sunny carried out here were 
proportionate and it wasnt irresponsible to lend on this basis.
There was a gap of almost six months then between Mr L repaying loan 2 and taking 
out loan 3 in February 2018. Given hed been borrowing for just a few weeks before this gap 
and he applied for a similar amount on his return, I dont think it was unreasonable of Sunny 
to think that Mr Ls circumstances had moved on, that he was in a better position to take on 
credit and so in assessing his application for a third loan could treat him as it would a new 
customer.
Mr L took out three loans altogether that February and one in March amounting to £700, allof 
which he repaid in March. He took out more loans in April, repaying them in May and July, 
and borrowed again in July and August.
Sunny said that Mr L repaid all his loans, sometimes early. Successfully repaying loans 
however, doesnt necessarily equate to being able to repay them sustainably, in other words 
without having to borrow again or go without. Bearing in mind that the purpose of short term 
lending is intended to address a temporary shortfall in income, the emerging pattern inMr Ls case of borrowing continuously and taking out further credit after making repayments 
is suggestive of someone who has an ongoing need for credit not just a temporary shortfall.
Our adjudicator found that Sunny ought to have declined to lend to Mr L when hed taken out 
several concurrent loans because it was likely he had problems managing his money. Sunny 
disagreed and said that allowing customers to take out a number of loans provided flexibility. 
I dont think that having concurrent loans is automatically indicative of money problems. 
However, I do think that continually taking out loans warrants a higher level of affordability 
check the longer it goes on.
I think Sunny ought to have carried out further checks when Mr Ls borrowing continued into 
April 2018. I dont it was fair to Mr L to continue to rely on what he said about his 
circumstances and it would have been proportionate of Sunny to begin to verify the 
information he provided. I cant see that it did this, so I dont think its checks were 
proportionate from this point onwards.
Mr L hasnt provided his credit file or any bank statements so I have limited information 
about his financial situation or how he was managing any existing credit commitments. I 
dont have enough information to determine what the lender might have found out about his 
circumstances and whether it would have declined to lend to him at any point. And looking at 
everything, I havent seen any strong indications in the information I do have to suggest that 
Sunny should have declined to lend to Mr L in the months before August 2018. However, I 
think it ought to have stopped lending to him then.
Sunny offered to refund the interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 23 onwards because it 
said it ought to have asked him more questions about his circumstances looking at his 
overall usage. I agree that it was irresponsible to have agreed these loans but I also think 
Sunny should have stopped lending to Mr L before then, specifically when he asked for his 
13th loan on 26 August 2018.
Mr L had borrowed £250 in February 2018 (his third loan) and was still indebted to Sunny for 
that amount. Hed been almost continuously in debt to Sunny for about six months by then 
and hadnt made any inroads into reducing his debt. I think at that point, if not before, the 
pattern of lending itself indicated that Mr L wasnt managing to repay his loans in a 
sustainable way. I think Sunny should have recognised this and declined to lend to him.
Sunny says that this was too early in its relationship with Mr L to consider that he had 
become dependent on its product and, had he been a lot further along at that point, it would 
be able to understand this conclusion. I disagree with this. Mr Ls pattern of taking out further 
loans when he repaid previous loans had been demonstrated clearly by this point. The 
pattern suggests to me that Mr L couldnt repay his debt without needing to borrow again, 
that he wasnt managing to meet his repayments sustainably and had an ongoing need for 
additional income. Mr L continued to take out loans in this way for several months beyond 
this point.
I think Mr L lost out when Sunny agreed loan 13 and went on to agree more loans for him 
because these loans unfairly prolonged his indebtedness and allowed him to take expensive 
credit intended for short term use over an extended period of time. The number of loans and 
length of time he borrowed over was likely to be seen negatively by other lenders, potentially 
keeping him in the market for high cost loans.
Putting things rightAs Ive explained above, I find that Sunny was irresponsible to have agreed further credit for 
Mr L from and including his 13th loan taken out on the 26 August 2018. In order to put things 
right for him, Sunny should
refund all interest and charges Mr L paid on loans 13 to 27; and
pay interest on all these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to
the dates of settlement; and
remove all information about these loans from Mr Ls credit file because any
information recorded about them is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must
give Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
As Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Ls complaint about Elevate Credit International Limited 
trading as Sunny and require it to put things right for him as Ive set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 July 2020.
