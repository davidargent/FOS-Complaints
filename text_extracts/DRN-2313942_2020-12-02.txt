The complaint
Mr. G is unhappy that the way Currency Solutions Ltd (CSL) handled a currency transaction 
left him with a loss. He would like to be reimbursed 1301.07 Euros with 5% interest from 23 
December 2019
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusion reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons: -
The trade confirmation notice Mr. G received on 19 December 2019 made it clear the 
funds deposited were to be in AED. But there is no dispute that the deposit Mr. G 
made was in Euros not AED. I dont know why that was but its clear this was a 
mistake on Mr. Gs part not CSLs.
I understand its the receiving banks policy is to only query transactions made in the 
wrong currency when the amount is over Â£1000,000 which is why it didnt query or 
reject this transaction. 
CSLs terms and conditions make it clear that it is not liable for any losses incurred 
from using its own intermediary or routing bank. I do believe these terms and 
conditions were available for Mr. G to look at when he made his transaction.
I understand CSL did offer to cover half of Mr. Gs losses by making him a payment 
of 651 Euros as a gesture of goodwill. We have checked with CSL and it is still willing 
to make this payment. I think this is a fair resolution to Mr. Gs complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that Currency Solutions Limited should make a gesture of goodwill 
payment of 650 Euros to Mr G.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 December 2020.
