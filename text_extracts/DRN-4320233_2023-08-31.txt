The complaint
Mrs B complains that First Holiday Finance Limited wont refund to her the money that she 
paid for some holiday club membership points. Shes being represented in her complaint by 
a claims management company.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint last month in which I described what had 
happened as follows:
Mrs B and her husband entered into an acquisition agreement in July 2011 to buy 
some holiday club membership points from a holiday company. The purchase price 
of the points was £35,087 and they traded in a trial membership which was given a 
value of £5,995 so the balance due from them was £29,092. Mrs B and her husband 
entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with First Holiday Finance for a loan of 
£9,229 and they agreed to make 144 monthly loan repayments of £131.53 to First 
Holiday Finance. Mrs B also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with another 
lender for a loan which she used to pay the rest of the purchase price to the holiday 
company.
Mrs Bs and her husbands representative made claims, on their behalf, to First 
Holiday Finance in July 2018 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974 and for breach of fiduciary duty. It said that the holiday company was is in 
breach of contract, there was a breach of fiduciary duty because First Holiday 
Finance paid a commission to the holiday company but didnt obtain Mrs Bs and her 
husbands informed consent to the commission, and the agreement, and the related 
agreement, are unfair. Claims were also made to the other lender and a complaint 
relating to those claims is being dealt with separately.
First Holiday Finance didnt provide a substantive response to the claims that had 
been made to it so a complaint was made to this service. Mrs Bs representative also 
raised its serious concerns about the way in which the finance was sold to Mrs B and 
her husband. Mrs Bs husband then sadly passed away and Mrs B made a 
settlement offer to First Holiday Finance. The outstanding balance of the loan 
account in October 2019 was £4,688.62 and Mrs B offered to pay £2,700, which First 
Holiday Finance accepted, and the loan was closed.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Bs complaint should be upheld. He set 
out the reasons that he wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the 
time of sale and that he didnt think that the holiday company had breached the 
contract. He said that he hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship 
between Mrs B and First Holiday Finance was unfair and he wasnt persuaded that a 
court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He also said that 
he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for 
Mrs B and that her representative had confirmed that Mrs B had no evidence to 
support that allegation so it had been agreed that the complaint about unaffordable 
lending was resolved.
Mrs Bs representative, on her behalf, says that it doesnt agree with our 
investigators recommendation and has asked for this complaint to be considered by 
an ombudsman.
I said in my provisional decision: I consider that Mrs Bs complaint shouldnt 
be upheld for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us 
and our rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other 
things  that we cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more 
than six years after the event complained of; or (if later) more than three 
years from the date on which the complainant became aware (or ought 
reasonably to have become aware) that they had cause for complaint;
Mrs Bs complaint is about First Holiday Finances response to the claims that 
had been made to it and I accept that her complaint was referred to this 
service within six years of her claims being made - but I need to consider 
whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to her claims;
Mrs Bs claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not 
determining the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would 
be able to do that - Im considering whether or not First Holiday Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of 
goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract 
or misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in 
that section are met);
Mrs Bs claim under section 75 is that theres been a breach of contract by the 
holiday company and that the membership points were misrepresented to her 
and her husband by the holiday company and that they wouldnt have bought 
them if they hadnt been misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, First Holiday Finance 
would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be 
entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action 
accrued (which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mrs B could have made a claim to the holiday company or First 
Holiday Finance about the misrepresentations that she says induced her and 
her husband into buying the membership points in July 2011 as that was the 
latest time that any misrepresentations would have been made to them and 
any loss would have been incurred as that was when they also entered into 
the loan agreement with First Holiday Finance;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have 
had six years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim under section 75 
against either the holiday company or First Holiday Finance  but such a 
claim wasnt made to First Holiday Finance until June 2018, more than six 
years later, so I consider that First Holiday Finance would have had a defence 
to that claim and I find that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to have 
rejected the claim;
Mrs Bs representative has also referred to breaches of contract by the holiday company, but the terms of the contract that it says have been 
breached werent part of Mrs Bs and her husbands contract with the holiday 
company  and I consider that First Holiday Finance would also have a 
defence to any such claim under the Limitation Act;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
breach of contract by the holiday company for which First Holiday Finance 
would be liable under section 75;
Mrs Bs representative says that there was a breach of fiduciary duty because 
First Holiday Finance paid a commission to the holiday company but didnt 
obtain Mrs Bs and her husbands informed consent to the commission - but it 
hasnt provided any more information or evidence to show that such a 
commission was paid and First Holiday Finance says that it didnt pay any 
commissions to the holiday company;
Im not persuaded that theres any evidence to support Mrs Bs 
representatives claim that First Holiday Finance paid a commission to the 
holiday company or that it acted in breach of any fiduciary duty;
Mrs Bs representative has described the reasons that it says that there was 
an unfair relationship between Mrs B and her husband and First Holiday 
Finance, including the commission that was paid by it to the holiday company, 
the manner in which the points were sold, the misrepresentations that were 
made by the holiday company and that Mrs Bs and her husbands financial 
means were limited and they could only afford to purchase the points with the 
help of the loan from First Holiday Finance;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a 
creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the 
creditor;
Ive already said that Im not persuaded that theres any evidence to support 
Mrs Bs representatives claim that First Holiday Finance paid a commission 
to the holiday company but it also described the misrepresentations that it 
says were made to Mrs B and her husband by the holiday company, including 
that:
they were advised that the standard of accommodation they 
experienced when using their trial membership would be the minimum 
standard that they should expect but the standard of accommodation 
that has been available to them has been far inferior to that and 
theyve been surprised at how poor the accommodation has been;
they were advised that entering into the agreement would be the 
equivalent to making a minimum risk investment, they would be 
eligible to sell the interest back to the holiday company after two years 
and its value would increase  but theres no option to sell the points 
back to the holiday company and their value will not increase;
they believed that they were buying into an exclusive membership but 
almost all of the properties can be accessed and booked by non-
members; and
they explained to the holiday company that they would require three 
bedroom accommodation but theyve taken holidays and have been 
unable to obtain any three bedroom accommodation;
although Mrs Bs representative has described those misrepresentations, it hasnt provided detailed information about the conversations that took place 
between Mrs B and her husband and the holiday company or evidence to 
support the claims about the alleged misrepresentations;
Mrs B and her husband signed the acquisition agreement and the loan 
agreement and I consider it to be likely that they would also have signed other 
documents relating to their purchase of the membership points but Ive not 
been provided with copies of any of those other documents;
Mrs Bs representative says that during the trial membership Mrs B and her 
husband had been placed in a luxury suite but Ive seen no other evidence to 
show that they were advised that all of the accommodation that would be 
available to them using the points would be luxury accommodation and Im 
not persuaded that its likely that the holiday company would have said that all 
of the accommodation would be luxurious;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect that any assurance about the 
holiday company buying their points from them after two years would be 
confirmed in writing but theres nothing in the acquisition agreement about a 
buy-back and Mrs B hasnt provided any other evidence to show that the 
holiday company said that it would buy the points from her and her husband 
after two years or that she and her husband have tried to sell their points back 
to the holiday company;
Im not persuaded that its likely that the holiday company would have advised 
Mrs B and her husband that the points would increase in value or that they 
were sold to them as an investment  nor am I persuaded that its likely that it 
would have said that the resorts were exclusive to members of the holiday 
club;
Mrs Bs representative says they Mrs B and her husband explained to the 
holiday company that they would require three bedroom accommodation but 
they bought membership points which entitled them to book accommodation 
and Ive seen no evidence to show that the holiday club doesnt include any 
three bedroom accommodation or that theyve unsuccessfully tried to book 
accommodation with three bedrooms;
Mrs B and her husband would have been aware of such issues when they 
took their holidays and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them 
to have contacted the holiday company about such issues soon after theyd 
happened  but Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs B and her husband 
contacted the holiday company before Mrs Bs representative made claims to 
First Holiday Finance in June 2018  about seven years after theyd bought 
the points;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership 
points were misrepresented to Mrs B and her husband by the holiday 
company or that they were induced into entering into the acquisition 
agreement by any such misrepresentations;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show Mrs B and her 
husband were unduly pressurised into buying the membership points or 
entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company used 
unacceptable sales practices against them;
if Mrs B and her husband had been unduly pressured into entering into the 
agreements, the holiday company had used unacceptable sales practices on 
them or they were concerned about the manner in which the points were sold 
to them, I would expect them to have complained to the holiday company or First Holiday Finance about those issues soon after theyd happened  but 
Ive seen no evidence to show that they complained about those issues until 
Mrs Bs representatives letter to First Holiday Finance in June 2018, about 
seven years later;
Mrs Bs representative says that Mrs Bs and her husbands financial means 
were limited and they could only afford to purchase the points with the help of 
the loan from First Holiday Finance - First Holiday Finance says that it carried 
out standard underwriting procedures based on the information supplied by 
them in order to ensure that the loan was affordable for them;
the loan account statement shows that the monthly payments were made 
from September 2011 to October 2019 when the account balance was 
£4,688.62 and that First Holiday Finance then accepted £2,700 from Mrs B in 
settlement of the loan and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mrs B and her husband in July 2011 
when it was made to them;
our investigator said that Mrs Bs representative had confirmed that Mrs B 
had no evidence to support an allegation about unaffordable lending so it had 
been agreed that the complaint about unaffordable lending was resolved and 
her representative has made no further comment in response to that;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan was 
mis-sold to Mrs B and her husband or that their relationship with First Holiday 
Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would 
conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs B and First 
Holiday Finance in these circumstances;
First Holiday Finance didnt issue a substantive response to the claims that 
were made to in June 2018 so I cant say that its response to those claims 
was fair and reasonable  but if it had properly responded to the claims I 
consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it not to have upheld 
them; and
I sympathise with Mrs B for the loss of her husband and for the issues that 
shes had with the membership points, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require First Holiday Finance to 
refund to Mrs B any of the money that she paid under the loan agreement, to 
pay her any compensation or to take any other action in response to her 
complaint.
Subject to any further comments or evidence that I received from any of Mrs B, her 
representative and First Holiday Finance, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend to 
uphold this complaint. Ive received no further comments or evidence in response to my 
provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Ive received no further comments or evidence in response to my provisional decision, I 
see no reason to change the findings that I set out in that provisional decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont hold Mrs Bs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 September 2023.
