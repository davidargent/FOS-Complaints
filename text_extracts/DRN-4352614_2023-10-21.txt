The complaint
Mr R complains about a car he acquired under a conditional sale agreement (agreement) 
with Moneybarn No. 1 Limited (Moneybarn). Mr R says he was never advised the car was 
an import and he has had to spend substantial sums on repairs. 
What happened
In July 2021 Mr R entered into an agreement for a used car. Under the terms of the 
agreement, everything else being equal, Mr R undertook to make 52 monthly repayments of 
£350.11 making a total repayable of £18,205.72 at an APR of 31.9%. 
In August 2021, for reasons not material to this complaint, the above car was exchanged by 
the original supplying dealership for another.
In October 2021 the car provided to Mr R in August 2021 was inspected by an engineering 
company that I will call A. Having inspected the car, A concluded that it was of satisfactory 
quality when first supplied to Mr R.
In December 2021 Mr R entered into a new agreement for the car provided to him in 
August 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, everything else being equal, Mr R 
undertook to make 37 monthly repayments of £350.01 making a total repayable of 
£12,950.37 at an APR of 31.9%. 
In November 2022 Mr R complained to Moneybarn that it had come to his attention that the 
car he was supplied with in August 2021 was an import. A fact he was never advised of.
In February 2023, the car having been returned, Moneybarn advised Mr R that his 
agreement would be cancelled and it would return the sum of £450.00 he had paid it in 
January 2023 together with £5.52 in net interest, which it did.
In May 2023 Moneybarn confirmed to our service that it was prepared to pay Mr R £300 in 
compensation.
Mr Rs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
Moneybarn, other than having to pay Mr R £300, need do nothing further.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First, Im very aware that Ive summarised this complaint in far less detail than the parties 
and Ive done so using my own words. Im not going to respond to every single point made 
by all the parties involved. No discourtesy is intended by this. Instead, Ive focussed on what 
I think are the key issues here. 
Our rules allow me to do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as a free 
alternative to the courts. If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive ignored 
it. Rather, Im satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual argument to be able to 
reach what I think is the right outcome.
Where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive, or contradictory (as some of it is here), I 
reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most 
likely to have happened in the light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances.
The facts of this case arent in dispute, that is in July 2021 Mr R was supplied with the wrong 
car and the car he was later supplied with in August 2021, by way of an exchange, was an 
import, a fact not brought to Mr Rs attention.
Moneybarn have already taken the car back, cancelled the agreement, refunded Mr R 
£450.00 and paid him £5.52 in interest. It has also offered Mr R a further £300. So all Im 
required to decide in this case is whether Moneybarn should have to compensate Mr R any 
further.
Mr R was supplied with a car (in August 2021) with a recorded mileage of approximately 
66,500 miles. When Moneybarn accepted the return of the car (in late 2022/early 2023) it 
had a recorded mileage of approximately 111,500. This means that whilst the car was in 
Mr Rs possession he added in the region of 45,000 miles to the odometer.
Notwithstanding that its not in dispute that Mr R was supplied with a car that was an import, 
a fact that wasnt brought to his attention, its only fair that he should have to pay for the 
usage he has had of the car and this is something the contract and legislation allows for.
Based on what both parties have said and submitted, its my understanding that between 
August 2021 and November 2021 Mr R paid Moneybarn, and Moneybarn has retained, 
£4,900.64 (5 x £350.11 plus 9 x £350.01) in repayments, which equates to less than 10 
pence per mile. And in my view this represents a fair and reasonable sum for Mr R to have 
to pay for usage. Therefore Im satisfied that Moneybarn need pay Mr R nothing further in 
this respect.
I will now turn to what Mr R says he had to spend maintaining and repairing the car.
Based on what Mr R has provided our service Im satisfied that he has paid a garage that I 
will call L over £2,000 for maintenance and/or repairs. But other than two invoices from L 
dated 28 April 2022 and 11 May 2022 Mr R hasnt provided anything to support what this 
expenditure was for. He certainly hasnt provided anything to show that this expenditure was 
in respect of repairs (rather than maintenance) or in respect of repairs that were needed due 
to the car being of unsatisfactory quality when first supplied. 
The first invoice provided by Mr R is for £240 and in respect of work undertaken on the front 
brake pads and discs. Notwithstanding pads and discs are, in my view, serviceable items 
these were repaired/replaced after Mr R had added in the region of 20,000 miles to the 
odometer. This, together with the report from A dated August 2021 and what Mr R has been 
able (or unable) to provide our service, leads me to conclude that the car supplied to him in 
August 2021 was of satisfactory quality. Therefore Im satisfied that Moneybarn need pay 
Mr R nothing further in this respect.
Having said the above I do accept that the customer service Mr R has received from 
Moneybarn has been poor. But like the investigator Im satisfied that Moneybarns offer of 
£300 for this poor service represents, in the particular circumstances of this case, an 
appropriate sum for it to have to pay and it need pay Mr R nothing further in this respect.My final decision
My final decision is that Moneybarn No. 1 Limited must pay Mr R £300, to the extent it hasnt 
done so already, but it need do nothing further.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2023.
