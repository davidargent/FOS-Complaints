The complaint
Mr I complains PrePay Technologies Limited, trading as Prepay Solutions unfairly blocked 
his account and hasnt returned the balance of the account to him. He wants the balance 
returned.
What happened
Mr I held a Monese account provided by PrePay. In April 2021 PrePay restricted his 
account, which prevented him accessing any of the funds held in it. PrePay asked him for 
information which Mr I provided, but he still couldnt access his account.
Mr I complained about what was happening and PrePay offered him Â£50 for having to wait 
for an update from its compliance team. But, PrePay said it was acting in line with the 
account terms and conditions and its regulatory obligations by continuing to block the 
account.
Mr I brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator didnt uphold his complaint. They 
concluded PrePay acted in line with its legal and regulatory obligations when restricting his 
account and they didnt need to tell him why.
Unhappy with the outcome reached by our investigator, Mr I asked for a final decision by an 
ombudsman. So, his complaint has been given to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Is complaint. Ill explain why.
PrePay has important legal and regulatory obligations to meet when providing accounts to 
customers. Those obligations are ongoing and dont only apply when an account is opened. 
They can broadly be summarized as a responsibility to know its customer and verify their 
sources of income, as well as detect and prevent other harm.
PrePay will review accounts to comply with its responsibilities. And, its common industry 
practice for firms to restrict access to accounts to conduct a review - doing so helps prevent 
potential financial loss or other harm that could otherwise result. I find PrePay acted fairly by 
blocking Mr Is account and it didnt need to tell him the reasons behind its decision or 
forewarn him of its intentions. Neither did it need to provide any detail behind how its review 
was progressing. I have reviewed its reasons and I find they were legitimate and reasonable. 
I am also satisfied based on the information I have seen that PrePay do not now need to 
refund any funds or balance previously held by Mr I. I find its decision complies with its legal 
and regulatory obligations. So, I am not going to direct PrePay to take any further action or 
pay Mr I any compensation.
My final decision
I have decided not to uphold Mr Is complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2022.
