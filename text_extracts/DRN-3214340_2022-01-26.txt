The complaint
Mr R is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc closed his accounts.
What happened
Mr R had several accounts with NatWest, including a current account, and a loan. He found 
himself in financial difficulties and struggled to pay his loan payments during 2019. And, on 
31 January 2020, NatWest closed his accounts, asking him to repay both the outstanding 
balance on the loan, and his overdraft in full.
Mr R complained to NatWest about their decision to close his accounts. He believes they 
havent treated him fairly, that they violated his rights, and that theyve were discriminating 
against him. He didnt think that NatWest should be asking him for payments on his closed 
accounts; and he thought they hadnt acted in line with the Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) guidance because they didnt have a good reason to close his accounts.
NatWest didnt think theyd done anything wrong, and they didnt think they discriminated 
against Mr R. They explained that Mr Rs overdraft was repayable on demand if any of the 
terms of his accounts werent met. And, because hed missed payments to his loan  which 
was a breach of the terms - theyd taken the decision to close his accounts and to ask him to 
repay what he owed them.
Mr R wasnt happy with NatWests response, and he brought his complaint to us for 
investigation. Hes asked for NatWest to apologise, reinstate his accounts, refund any fees, 
any pay him compensation for his loss.
Our investigator said she hadnt seen anything to show her that NatWest had discriminated 
against Mr R, and she thought hed been treated fairly. She said the terms of his accounts 
with NatWest explained that these could be terminated if he failed to make payments, and 
that NatWest would give Mr R at least 60 days notice of any potential closure. 
The investigator said NatWest wrote to Mr R on 10 October 2019, explaining their intention 
to close his accounts, and what he needed to do to stop this happening. And they closed his 
accounts on 31 January 2020. She also said that, because Mr R had missed payments on 
his loan account, NatWest had good reason to close his accounts. And this included asking 
Mr R to repay his overdraft. So, she didnt think NatWest needed to do anything more.
Mr R didnt agree with the investigator and he said, I suspect that my accounts were closed 
due to the Brexit situation and personal prejudice of Natwests staff. Hes referred to the 
FCA guidelines, as well as the Payment Account Regulation 2015, and explained why he 
thinks NatWest havent acted in accordance with these. Hes also explained that hes a 
vulnerable person, due to a medical condition, but doesnt think that NatWest have taken this 
into consideration. And he would like his case decided on applicable law, whether there has 
been any illegal or wrong action by {NatWest}.
So, this has been passed to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having reviewed the evidence, I agree with the investigators findings on this complaint for 
broadly the same reasons. If I havent commented on any specific point, its because I dont 
believe its affected what I think is the right outcome. 
Before I address the facts of the case, I think it would be useful to explain the scope of my 
decision. The Financial Ombudsman Service is an alternative to the courts, and were not 
able to make a judgement on whether a financial business has acted illegally with reference 
to any specific piece of legislation  this is something only a court could decide. Its also not 
our role to tell a financial business what policies and procedures they must have in place; 
this is something that a financial business would decide with the FCA.
So, I wont be commenting specifically on any piece of specific legislation or making any 
judgements on whether NatWests policies and procedures breach any FCA guidance.
On 30 April 2018, Mr R took out a £7,500 loan with NatWest; to be repaid over 60 months 
with monthly repayments of £147.53. The payments up to July 2019 were all paid, although 
the payment for February 2019 was paid late. Mr R didnt make the payments for August or 
September 2019 but cleared the arrears on 17 October 2019. The payments for October and 
November 2019 were also missed, but these arrears were cleared on 6 December 2019. Mr 
R then missed the payment for December 2019.
The terms of the loan account said that, if Mr R failed to make a monthly payment within one 
month of the due date, or if a default arose from any of his other liabilities with them; then 
NatWest were entitled to close the account (and demand immediate repayment).
On 10 October 2019, NatWest wrote to Mr R about his current account and savings account. 
They told him that, because of the continued unsatisfactory operation of his loan, they 
intended to close his accounts. The letter also said that, if his current account was still 
overdrawn by 9 November 2019, they would write to him demanding repayment of this. 
NatWests system notes show Mr R contacted them on 25 October 2019. The notes say that 
he told them he would clear the loan arrears on the first week of November. However, he 
didnt do this. Because of this NatWest wrote to Mr R on 12 November 2019, in relation to 
his current account. This letter, headed Formal notice of intention to take action to recover 
the debt, explained that, unless Mr R agreed a payment arrangement with them by 13 
December 2019, they would take action to cancel his account. 
Mr R paid his outstanding arrears on 6 December 2019. However, because the December 
2019 loan payment wasnt made, NatWest wrote to Mr R on 24 January 2020, in relation to 
his current account. This letter headed Formal notice of intention to take action to recover 
the debt, explained that, unless Mr R agreed a payment arrangement with them, they would 
take action to cancel his account. 
On 31 January 2020 NatWest wrote to Mr R, telling him that hed failed to comply with the 
requirements set out in the recent Default Notice. And, because of this, they asked him to 
repay his loan by no later than 8 February 2020. In a separate letter the same day, NatWest 
told Mr R that, because he hadnt complied with the requirements of the recent Notice, 
served under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, his overdraft limit had been reduced to zero. 
NatWest also asked him to repay the outstanding balance by no later than 8 February 2020.Mr R was not making payments in line with the loan agreement. NatWest sent him two 
letters headed Formal notice of intention to take action to recover the debt. Im satisfied 
that Mr R received these letters, as hes provided us with a copy of them. Ive also seen that 
these letters contained all the information required for a default notice. Because of this, even 
though Mr R cleared his arrears twice, Im satisfied that, once Mr R started missing 
payments again, NatWest acted reasonably by terminating the loan agreement and asking 
Mr R to repay the outstanding balance.
The terms of Mr Rs accounts with NatWest also allowed them to close his other accounts. 
But to do so, they would need to have a valid reason, and they would need to give Mr R at 
least 60 days notice of the closure. 
Mr R had a large overdraft with NatWest, and the way Mr R was managing his account 
meant that he wasnt reducing this. And his account was never going into credit, even for just 
a few days, on a monthly basis. Unlike a fixed term loan, an overdraft is a rolling credit 
facility. So, NatWest would have reassessed the lending risk on a regular basis. Because of 
this, and because of how Mr R was managing his loan account, Im satisfied that NatWest 
had a valid reason to ask Mr R to repay his overdraft.
Mr R has said that NatWest didnt provide him with a reasonable amount of time to repay the 
overdraft, as per the FCA guidelines. But NatWest first told Mr R on 10 October 2019 that 
they intended to close his accounts. And they explained that they required him to repay his 
overdraft. The accounts werent closed until 31 January 2020  113 days after first giving 
notice. Not only is this more than the minimum 60 days NatWest were required to provide, 
Im satisfied this was sufficient time for Mr R to open new accounts with a different financial 
provider, and to obtain another overdraft or loan to repay NatWests overdraft if he was 
unable to repay this from his own funds.
Because of the above, I dont think that NatWest did anything wrong by closing Mr Rs 
accounts, after giving the required notice, and doing so in line with the terms and conditions 
of the accounts.
However, its clear to me that Mr R was not able to repay the overdraft and loan in January 
2020. And this leaves him with an outstanding debt to NatWest which still needs to be 
repaid. The FCA have issued guidance that says that NatWest should treat people in Mr Rs 
position with forbearance and consideration. And I would expect NatWest to do this.
Im pleased to see that NatWest have asked Mr R to complete an income and expenditure 
form, so they can assess how much hes able to pay towards his debts. And, while this form 
hasnt been fully completed by Mr R, hes declared a monthly income of £7,000, and monthly 
expenditure (rent and household bills only) of £1,200. So Id expect NatWest to work with Mr 
R to try and reach an appropriate repayment plan.
Mr R has also provided us with details of his medical condition. But I havent seen that hes 
provided this to NatWest. So I cant say that NatWest have done anything wrong by not 
acting on information they werent aware of. But I would expect NatWest to take this into 
consideration once Mr R shares this information with them.
Finally, Mr R has said that NatWest have shown no tolerance, reluctance, malevolence, 
persecution, hate, segregation, hostile prejudice, xenophobia, chauvinism, and extreme 
nationalism by terminating his accounts on Brexit Day. This is despite his rights being 
guaranteed in international agreements between the United Kingdom and the European 
Union.From what Ive seen, I havent seen anything that shows me that NatWest have 
discriminated against Mr R in any way, or that hes been treated any differently to how 
NatWest would treat any customer in the same circumstances. NatWest did close Mr Rs 
accounts on 31 January 2020 - the day the United Kingdom formally left the European 
Union, and what Mr R has referred to as Brexit Day. But I havent seen anything that 
indicates this is anything other than a coincidence. And Im satisfied that the date of closure 
had nothing to do with Mr Rs immigration status on that day, or at any time previously. So I 
wont be asking NatWest to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint about National 
Westminster Bank Plc.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 February 2022.
