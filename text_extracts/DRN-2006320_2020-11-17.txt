The complaint
Mrs E complains about the amount that shes been charged by Arval UK Limited for damage 
to a car that she returned when she ended her hire agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mrs E under a hire agreement with Arval in December 
2014 but Arval hasnt been able to provide a copy of the agreement;
its my understanding that the hire period set out in the agreement was 24 months, 
that Mrs E paid an advance rental of £1,241.89 and agreed to make monthly 
payments of £137.99  but she kept the car until July 2019 so had it for at least 54 
months;
Mrs E returned the car to Arval in July 2019 and it inspected the car and produced a 
damage recharge schedule which identified nine issues with the car with a total cost 
of £1,153  it also recorded the cars mileage as being 43,864;
it says that it sent an invoice for that amount to Mrs E and it then collected the 
payment from her account  she says that she didnt receive the invoice, the 
payment caused her account to become overdrawn and there was a delay in the 
payment being refunded to her;
Mrs E complained to Arval and then to this service about the charges  our 
investigator said that some of the damage was fair wear and tear so those charges 
werent reasonable and should be waived  but he said that the charges for a 
replacement key and damage to the front bumper and right door mirror housing were 
reasonable and that it was fair and reasonable for it to charge Mrs E £278;
Mrs E has accepted the investigators recommendations but Arval didnt, though it 
offered to reduce the total charge to £793;
Mrs E had the car for about 54 months and drove it for 43,864 miles  during that 
time she will have paid £8,693.35 to hire the car based on an advance rental of 
£1,241.89 and 54 monthly payments of £137.99;
although its clear from the damage recharge schedule that there was damage to the 
car when it was returned by Mrs E, I consider that its reasonable for any assessment 
of whether or not the damage was fair wear and tear to take account of the time that 
Mrs E had the car, the mileage that shes driven in it and the payments that shes 
made to hire the car; and
having done that, Im not persuaded that the damage to the cars bonnet, left quarter 
panel, rear bumper, right D post, right sill panel or right front door is more than would 
reasonably be considered to be fair wear and tear in these circumstances  so I dont 
consider that its fair or reasonable for Arval to charge Mrs E for that damage - but I 
do consider that its fair and reasonable for it to charge her £150 for the replacement 
key, £80 for the damage to the front bumper and £48 for the right door mirror 
housing. 
Putting things right
I find that its fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Arval to reduce the amount that 
its charged Mrs E from £1,153 to £278. Mrs E says that she agrees to pay £278 to Arval and 
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to pay her any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mrs Es complaint in part and I order Arval UK Limited to reduce 
the amount that its charged Mrs E to £278.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2020.
