The complaint
Mr S says that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA mismanaged his account when he disputed 
some transactions.
What happened
On 27 June 2019, Mr S sent a seller £1, then sent them £79 the next day. So he sent them 
£80 in total.
The initial £1 was sent from his bank account. The £79 payment was split: £59.50 of that 
was sent from his bank account, while £19.50 was sent from his PayPal balance.
While these types of payments are sent instantly, they take a few days to register on 
statements. So the £1 and £59.50 payments didnt appear on Mr Ss bank statement until 
2 July 2019.
Mr S didnt recognise those transactions and disputed them, so his bank asked PayPal to 
reverse the payments.
Following Mr S and his banks instructions, PayPal took the £80 back from the seller. They 
refunded the £1 and £59.50 back to Mr Ss bank account where theyd come from, and put 
the £19.50 back in his PayPal account where that had come from.
The seller complained to Mr S about having the payment reversed. Mr S was embarrassed, 
and paid them by cheque instead.
Mr S would like PayPal to compensate him for what happened. He believes that the £1 and 
£59.50 transactions have nothing to do with the £80 he paid the seller, and thinks PayPal 
took the money back from the seller in error. He does not believe that its possible for a 
transaction to debit instantly but then take time to show up on statements.
He wasnt sure where else the £1 and £59.50 transactions came from, as there are no such 
corresponding payments on his PayPal history. But he feels sure they have nothing to do 
with the £80 he paid the seller. He suggested they might be related to a £47.59 (or 59.90 
USD) transaction from a couple of days later. Lastly, he says that if PayPal refunded him 
£80, then there should be £80 in his PayPal account instead of £19.50, and he doesnt know 
where the other £60.50 went.
Our investigator looked into things independently and didnt uphold the complaint. He 
explained how statement dates work. He set out that the £1 and £59.50 were indeed from 
Mr Ss payment to the seller, and were returned to his bank account at his request. Adding 
those refunds together gets the £60.50 that Mr S thought was missing. The investigator 
confirmed that the payments Mr S reported were his own payments to the seller, and PayPal 
hadnt made an error.
Mr S didnt agree, so the complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked carefully at Mr Ss account history and everything that both sides have sent us. 
Having done that, Ive come to the same conclusions as our investigator, and for much the 
same reasons.
I will firstly explain that while this type of payment will usually go through instantly, it will often 
take a few days to then appear on a bank statement.
For instance, if I transfer money to my friend on 1 January, the friend will usually receive the 
money on 1 January, within minutes or even seconds. However, the payment might not 
show up on my bank statements until, say, 5 January. While the payment can arrive with the 
recipient very quickly, it still takes time to get processed for statement purposes. Often times, 
the date on the statement is not actually the date the payment went through. This is normal.
In this case, Mr S made the payments to the seller on 27 and 28 June 2019, but they did not 
appear on his bank statements until 2 July 2019.
Mr S disputed payments for £1 and £59.50, dated 2 July 2019 on his statements. Those 
were the same payments as the ones he made to the seller on 27 and 28 June 2019.
I understand Mr Ss confusion, as he was trying to pay £80, and not £60.50. To explain, his 
initial £1 payment was funded directly from his bank account. His £79 payment was then 
funded partly by taking £19.50 from his PayPal balance, and partly by taking £59.50 from his 
bank account. This resulted in the £1 and £59.50 payments showing up on his bank 
statements on 2 July 2019. The £19.50 did not show up on his bank statements because it 
went directly from his PayPal balance, and not his bank account balance.
Adding the amounts together: £1, £59.50, and £19.50, gives the £80 Mr S sent the seller.
So the payments that Mr S disputed were his payments to the seller. Thats why PayPal then 
took the money back from the seller  because thats what he asked for.
The reason why Mr S couldnt find any other payments for £1 and £59.50 dated 2 July 2019 
on his PayPal history is because there arent any. The payments he disputed were 
constituent parts of the £80 he sent to the seller; they werent separate transactions.
I understand that Mr S may have got things mixed up with a different transaction, for $59.90. 
But that other transaction was on 4 July 2019, two days after the ones he actually disputed. 
And while I appreciate that the other payment looks similar, as its 59.90 in US dollars  its 
not the same number as the £59.50 he reported as fraud. And its in a different currency  it 
was only £47.59 in pounds. It was also a credit into his account, not a debit, that was then 
sent on to his credit card. The other payment does not appear to be related to either of the 
payments that Mr S actually disputed. Mr S can dispute that other payment separately if he 
feels its fraudulent activity, but I dont think its relevant to this case.Lastly, Mr S feels that his PayPal balance should be £80. But Im afraid hes mistaken. When 
he disputed the payments, PayPal were supposed to refund them back to where they came 
from. And thats what they did: they sent the £19.50 back to his PayPal balance, and the £1 
and £59.50 back to his bank account. Thats where those payments came from, so this was 
correct  PayPal did not make an error.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
This final decision marks the end of our services consideration of the case.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2020.
