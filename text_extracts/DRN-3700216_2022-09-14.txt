The complaint
Ms B complains that NewDay Ltd acted irresponsibly when they agreed to provide her with 
two credit card accounts and subsequently increased her credit limits.   
What happened
Ms B applied to NewDay for a Marbles Classic branded credit card in March 2016. NewDay 
assessed and agreed her application. They provided a credit card account with an initial limit 
of £450.
NewDay wrote to Ms B offering and then applying the following limit increases:
Increase to £850 offered July 2016 and made available September 2016;
Increase to £1,100 offered and marked in January 2017;
Increase to £1,600 offered and marked in May 2017.
Ms B contacted NewDay in September 2017 requesting a further limit increase. NewDay 
agreed to increase Ms Bs limit to £2,350.
Ms B also applied to NewDay for their Aqua Classic branded credit card in May 2017. 
NewDay assessed and agreed her application. They provided a credit card account with an 
initial limit of £300.
NewDay wrote to Ms B in March 2018 offering to increase her Aqua credit card limit to £600. 
The new limit was marked on her account in May 2018.
In February 2021, Ms B wrote to NewDay to complain. She said theyd leant money to her at 
a time when she couldnt afford it. She said she had other credit obligations at the time and 
NewDays actions meant she couldnt afford to repay the borrowing and it adversely 
impacted her credit file.
Ms B said this limited her employment opportunities and caused her distress. She wanted 
NewDay to write off interest and remove adverse information from her credit file.
NewDay responded to Ms Bs complaint in April 2021. They didnt agree theyd acted 
irresponsibly when they agreed to provide credit cards and limit increases. NewDay said 
their decisions were based on information Ms B had provided in her application(s) together 
with information provided by credit reference agencies. They also took account of how shed 
used her account(s) with them. Ms B wasnt happy with NewDays response to her 
complaint. So, she referred matters to this service. 
Having considered all the available information, our investigator thought NewDay hadnt 
acted fairly. She thought NewDays decision to give Ms B a Marbles card account was 
reasonable together with their decision to increase Ms Bs credit limit in September 2016. 
But she didnt think NewDays decisions to increase Ms Bs Marbles account limit further in 
January, May and September 2017 were made responsibly.
Our investigator also thought NewDays decision to provide an Aqua card account to Ms B in 
May 2017 was made reasonably. But she didnt think NewDay had acted reasonably when 
they agreed to increase the Aqua card account limit to £600 in May 2018. 
Our investigator thought NewDay should refund any interest theyd charged on Ms Bs 
Marbles account in respect of any amount owed above £850 from January 2017. She also 
thought NewDay should refund any interest theyd charged on Ms Bs Aqua account in 
respect of any amount owed above £300 from May 2018. Where this resulted in any 
overpayment, she thought Aqua should add 8% simple interest.
NewDay didnt agree with our investigators findings. In respect of Ms Bs Marbles account, 
they said the only negative information reported was one over-limit fee and one payday loan. 
They didnt agree the operation of Ms Bs account gave cause to complete further checks 
and tests. They thought the same applied for Ms Bs Aqua account.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Ms Bs complaint has been passed to me to consider. 
In doing so, I reached a different outcome to that of our investigator. Because of that, I 
issued a provisional decision on 24 August 2022  giving both Ms B and NewDay the 
opportunity to respond to my findings below before I reach a final decision.
In my provisional decision, I said:
The rules and guidance relevant at the time NewDay provided Ms B with the credit 
cards were set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC). These required NewDay to carry out an assessment using 
reasonable and proportionate checks to determine whether Ms B could afford to 
repay the credit cards in a sustainable way. Those checks needed to be borrower 
focussed and consider whether making the repayments could result in financial 
difficulties for Ms B.
This service believes that any checks needed to consider Ms Bs personal 
circumstances and would usually need to be more thorough:
the lower a consumers income; and
the higher the amount due to be repaid; and
the longer the term of the debt; and
the greater the number and frequency of debts.
Conversely, a less detailed affordability assessment, without the need for verification, 
is far more likely to be fair, reasonable, and proportionate where the amount to be 
repaid is relatively small, the financial situation appears stable, and the debt is for a 
relatively short period.
When Ms B first applied for a Marbles card, her application showed she had an 
income of £23,000 and existing debts of £3,400. No adverse information was 
reported on her credit file including defaults, late payments, arrangements or arrears. 
Based upon the information available to NewDay, I dont think there was anything to 
prompt further checks or tests in assessing Ms Bs application. So, I think NewDays 
decision to provide a Marbles card with an initial limit of £450 was reasonable.
When NewDay offered to increase the limit on Ms Bs Marbles account to £850, this 
was just four months after her original application. Shed exceeded her limit on one 
occasion and promptly adjusted this. No payments had been missed or been late and 
although her reported debt balances had risen, the total was not at a level that might 
cause concern. And as nothing adverse had been reported, I think NewDays 
decision to apply the higher limit was reasonable here.
Following this increase, Ms Bs account balance rose fairly quickly to utilise the new 
limit. It also appears she was mainly making minimum repayments. The debt 
balances reported to NewDay by the credit reference agencies rose to more than 
double that reported when the account was first opened. There was also evidence 
Ms B was regularly utilising payday loans. Given this information and recognising Ms Bs original application information was now 10 months old, I think there was enough 
to prompt NewDay to complete further checks and tests before offering to increase 
Ms Bs limit further in January 2017.
Ive considered what those test and checks may have revealed. Ms B has provided a 
copy of her credit file. This shows details of all credit facilities recorded over the past 
six years. The report shows Ms B had applied for, and utilised pay day loans on at 
least nine occasions during the seven months prior to January 2017 for amounts 
between £50 and £400. I think this, together with the fact Ms B was making mainly 
minimum payments and her personal debt had increased to almost £7,000, was 
enough to suggest her financial situation wasnt entirely stable. And I believe, had a 
responsible lender questioned Ms B at the time and established the full picture, they 
wouldnt have chosen to increase her limit further. 
Ms Bs credit file shows she continued to use Payday loans during 2017 and early 
2018. A further nine loans for amounts between £150 and £1,425 were recorded in 
addition to other borrowings. By July 2017, Ms Bs debts had risen to a peak of 
£18,000. I think this reinforces the suggestion that her financial situation may not 
have been stable. Ms B told this service she was utilising different cards and loans to 
fund her debt repayments. So, I think her ability to sustainably repay her debts 
appeared to be very limited. 
NewDay have suggested the information reported to them showed that Ms B only 
had one payday loan. While I see why they might think that, this only suggests she 
had one reported loan outstanding at any time. But it appears Ms B was regularly 
taking new loans each time one expired, and this was what was reported on her 
credit file. As Ive said above, I think further checks and tests may well have revealed 
that to NewDay. 
Having considered all of this, had further checks been completed and a fuller picture 
been established, I dont believe NewDays decision to increase Ms Bs limit further 
wouldve been considered responsible until they could be satisfied her financial 
situation had stabilised. And as she continued to apply for and use payday loans, I 
dont think the subsequent limit increases were appropriately provided either. 
As regards Ms Bs application for an Aqua card, given both accounts are provided by 
NewDay, Id have expected them to have had full visibility of Ms Bs total 
indebtedness with them, together with the regular data provided by the credit 
reference agencies. So, given Ive concluded limits shouldnt have been increased on 
her Marbles account, I also dont think it was appropriate for NewDay to agree to 
provide the Aqua card.
In summary, I think NewDays decision to provide Ms B with a Marbles card was 
reasonable, together with the limit increase in September 2016. But I dont think 
NewDay acted responsibly when they agreed subsequent increases or provided the 
Aqua card. So, I intend to ask NewDay to refund Ms Bs Marble account with all 
interest, charges and fees applied for any amount above £850 from the point the new 
limit of £1,100 was applied in January 2017. I also intend to ask NewDay to refund all 
interest charges and fees applied to Ms Bs Aqua account.Where the refunds result in an overpayment having been made by Ms B, I intend to 
ask NewDay to pay interest on that of 8% simple for the period of the overpayment. 
Once interest has been refunded, if a debt remains, I intend to ask NewDay to agree 
an affordable and sustainable repayment plan with Ms B. Ms B has benefitted from 
the money she borrowed, so I believe she should be asked to repay what she owes. 
However, I dont think Ms Bs credit file should be penalised by NewDays mistakes 
here. So, once the borrowing has been repaid, I intend to ask them to remove any 
adverse information reported.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms B responded accepting the recommendations in my provisional decision. NewDay said 
they had nothing further to add. So, Ive no reason to vary from my findings above.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold Ms Bs complaint
I require NewDay Ltd:
to refund all and any interest, charges and fees to the Marbles account in respect of 
any balance owed above £850 from when they increased Ms Bs limit to £1,100 in 
January 2017; and
to refund all interest and any charges and fees to the Aqua account from when it was 
first opened; and
to amend the monthly balances reported on Ms Bs credit file to reflect these refunds; 
and
to pay 8% interest on any overpayment from the date of payment until the date of 
settlement, if the effect of refunding all interest, fees and charges results in a credit 
balance being owed to Ms B; and 
where an amount is still owed by Ms B, to agree an affordable and sustainable 
repayment plan for that amount; and
to remove any current or subsequent related adverse information from Ms Bs credit 
file once the outstanding balances have been repaid.
HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to take off tax from this interest. NewDay must 
give Ms B a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 October 2022.
