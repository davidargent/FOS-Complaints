Our adjudicator partly upheld Ms Bs complaint and thought loan 7 onwards shouldnt have 
been given because the pattern of lending indicated Ms B was reliant on this type of 
borrowing. 
Lending Stream initially accepted the assessment but then asked for an ombudsmans 
decision and made the following points:
It asked why were loans 15 and 16 upheld when it had done full checks of Ms Bs bank 
statements. 
It asked if we were suggesting that from loan 11 onwards, no amount of checks would 
deem the lending affordable. 
As Lending Stream asked for an ombudsmans review, the complaint has been passed to 
me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure    
Ms B could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider a number 
of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether Ms B could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Ms Bs complaint. Having done this, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Ms Bs complaint about loans 1 to 6. Ms B didnt respond to the 
opinion. As there is no dispute about the adjudicators findings about these loans, I wont be 
making any further findings on them. Lending Stream says it carried out checks before it lent loan 7 to Ms B and the results of 
these checks didnt raise any concerns. But this was Ms Bs seventh loan in four months, so 
I think Lending Stream ought to have been looking to build a clearer picture than it did about   
Ms Bs finances before lending to her again. 
I say this because I think Ms B was having problems managing her money. She had over-
lapping loans  at times she had two loans outstanding when she returned to apply for 
another. In addition, she had repaid loan 5 on the same day she took out loan 7. This wasnt 
the first time she had repaid a loan and then almost immediately taken out another loan. For 
example, Ms B had repaid loans 2 and 4 on the same day and then just over two weeks later 
she returned to borrow loan 5. Given the nature of these types of loan, I would question why 
someone would repay one loan (or two loans) only to come back quickly and borrow more. 
The kind of behaviour Ms B was displaying would suggest to me she was juggling her 
finances to make ends meet. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Lending Streams lending history with Ms B, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Lending Stream should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Ms Bs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 11. I say 
this because:
At this point Lending Stream ought to have realised Ms B was not managing to repay 
her loans sustainably. Ms B had taken out 11 loans within eight months. So, Lending 
Stream ought to have realised it was more likely than not Ms B was having to borrow 
further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and 
that Ms Bs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably. Ive noted Lending Streams 
comments around the checks it did for the last two loans Ms B borrowed from it. But 
as Ive explained above, when it reaches a certain point of lending it doesnt matter 
whether the loans themselves were affordable but more the actual pattern of lending 
is harmful and unsustainable. 
Ms Bs first loan was for £200 and loan 11 was for £240. At this point Lending Stream 
ought to have known that Ms B was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall 
in her income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From loan 11 onwards Ms B was provided with a new loan within weeks of taking out 
her previous one.  
Ms B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Lending Stream. Loan 
16 was taken out ten months after Ms Bs first. And it was for a larger amount. Ms B 
had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Lending Stream over 
an extended period.
I think that Ms B lost out because Lending Stream provided borrowing for loan 11 onwards 
because:These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Bs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
The number of loans and the length of time over which Ms B borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Ms Bs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding Ms Bs complaint about loan 7 onwards and Lending Stream should put 
things right. 
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Ms B paid on loans 7 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 7 to 10 from Ms Bs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 11 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 11 to 16 should be removed from 
Ms Bs credit file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. Lending Stream 
must give Ms B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Ms Bs complaint. Gain Credit LLC 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 July 2020.
