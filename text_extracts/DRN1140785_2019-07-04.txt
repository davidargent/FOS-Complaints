K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid)  irresponsibly lent to him.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 10 June  2019  where  I set out a detailed 
background to this complaint. My provisional decision is attached at the end of this decision 
and forms part of my final decision.
Because I was reaching different conclusions to the adjudicator, I gave both parties the 
opportunity to provide further comments and evidence  before I issued my final decision. 
Since my provisional decision, this service  has been  made  aware that QuickQuid has written 
off the outstanding balance on Mr Gs last loan. QuickQuid, in its response  to my provisional 
decision, said in summary  that:
A fair determination  without review of each loan individually couldnt be reached and 
the adjudicators  view stated that loan 5 was affordable based  on Mr Gs bank 
statement.
Enhanced checks had been  implemented when Mr G borrowed loans 4a to 7b and 
there was no reason  to suggest  that he couldnt afford  to repay the loans.
Mr G had strong repayment history  he didnt incur late fees and repaid some loans 
early.
Mr G has also responded  and agreed  with my provisional findings.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And Ive also taken into consideration 
QuickQuids response  to my provisional  decision. My decision remains  unchanged  and Ill 
explain why.
I accept that the adjudicator worked  out Mr Gs income and expenses at the time of loan 5 
and thought that Mr G was able to afford the repayments. But as I stated in my provisional 
decision: 
I think it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid  was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable on this basis  might  be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this 
is the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  the rules  in place 
at the time QuickQuid  provided these loans,  defines  sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender  should  realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to 
realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without borrowing further.
Ref: DRN11407852And I still think that the fact that the adjudicators pounds  and pence  calculation suggested 
that Mr G could afford the loan repayments doesnt automatically mean the lending wasnt  
harmful of responsible. And as QuickQuid will know,  that the fact Mr G repaid this loan 
doesnt necessarily  suggest that he did so sustainably.
By the time of loan 4a, Mr G had established  a pattern of reliance on these  loans and 
QuickQuid as a responsible lender  ought  to have realised that its continued lending  was 
harmful to Mr G. QuickQuid ought  to have realised  that Mr Gs need to keep borrowing and 
to do so over an extended period of time suggests that he wasnt  using  the loans for their 
intended purpose of short  term cash flow and that he was unlikely to be repaying them 
without needing  to borrow further.
So regardless of the checks QuickQuid might have carried out, Mr Gs pattern of borrowing 
meant that it was wrong to continue to approve loans from 4a onwards. And as Mr G has lost 
out as result of being given loans when he shouldnt  have  been, QuickQuid needs to put 
things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 4a to 7b;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
as QuickQuid has written off the outstanding  balance on loan 8/8b, it may offset the 
written off capital balance from the redress amount above;
importantly QuickQuid  should ensure Mr G doesnt repay more than the capital 
amount borrowed  on loan 8/8b
the number  of loans taken from 4a onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  4a to 8b should be removed from Mr Gs 
credit file
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid 
must give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partially  uphold Mr Gs complaint  and ask CashEuroNet  UK 
LLC to pay compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 August 2019.

complaint
Mr G says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) irresponsibly lent to him. He says he 
couldnt afford  the loans and was stuck  in a debt spiral.
background
This complaint  is about eight payday loans QuickQuid provided to Mr G between May 2016 and 
August 2017.  Ive set out some of the information about Mr Gs loans with QuickQuid in an 
appendix at the end of this decision.
Mr G took out additional  borrowing on several of the loans, thereby topping-up  his principal loan 
amounts. And from what I can see theres an outstanding balance on the last loan.
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Gs complaint in part, and thought loans 4a and 5a to 8b shouldnt have 
been lent to Mr G because his circumstances  suggest that he couldnt afford  those loans. QuickQuid 
disagreed and the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair and reasonable in 
Ref: DRN11407854the circumstances of this complaint. Ive also considered QuickQuids response to the 
adjudication. But many  of these generic arguments have previously dealt with by this service  
through a number of final decisions. So I wont be going into further detail about  those arguments 
here and Ive focused  my decision  on the specifics of Mr Gs complaint.
Weve set out our general  approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including all of the 
relevant rules, guidance  and good  industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr G could repay  the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income  and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
 the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
 the higher the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  
a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
 the greater the number and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans  (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become,  or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish  whether  Mr 
G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were  affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow  this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  the rules in place at the time QuickQuid 
provided these loans,  defines sustainable  as being without undue difficulties and in particular the 
customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; 
as well as without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows  that a lender should 
realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing  
further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Gs complaints  complaint.
Our adjudicator explained that QuickQuids  checks for loans  1 to 4 went  far enough and based on 
those checks, Mr G was in a position to afford those loans. Ive reviewed what  our adjudicator said 
and the circumstances around  these loans and I agree that QuickQuid  wasnt wrong to lend Mr G 
these loans. I can see that Mr G hasnt disagreed with the adjudication and as there isnt an ongoing 
dispute about  these loans, I havent gone into further details about  them  here.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history  with Mr G, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which  QuickQuid should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt 
Ref: DRN11407855have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Gs case,  I think that this point was reached by loan 4a. I say 
this because by the time Mr G borrowed loan 4a hed been borrowing  regularly from QuickQuid for 
more than seven months without any noticeable breaks. This length of time suggests that Mr G may 
not have been using the loans as a temporary solution to cash flow problems  but was instead  reliant 
on these loans as a supplement to his income. This is something that shouldve concerned QuickQuid. 
I can also see that by loan 4a, Mr G was now due to make his largest repayment to QuickQuid 
compared to previous loans  and his loan amounts from this point were generally increasing.
From loan 4a onwards Mr G was provided  with a new loan within days  of settling a previous one. So 
QuickQuid ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Mr G was having to borrow further to 
cover the hole in his finances caused  by having to repay his previous loan, thereby unsustainably 
increasing Mr Gs indebtedness . I can see that Mr G repaid a number of the loans early  but that in 
my view doesnt  automatically mean that they were affordable or that he wasnt reliant on these 
loans. I think  that if his financial circumstances had improved, then he wouldnt have needed to 
borrow again  so quickly after repaying  the previous loan.
Also Mr G wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  he owed QuickQuid. Loan 8b was taken  
out nearly 16 months after Mr Gs first. And it was for a larger amount than his previous loans, 
cumulatively on loan 8 Mr G borrowed a principal amount of £1,150.  Mr G was required to pay large 
amounts of interest to access the borrowing and in effect, service a debt to QuickQuid over an 
extended period.
Taking everything Ive mentioned above, I think that Mr G lost out because QuickQuid 
continued to provide borrowing from loan 4a onwards because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive credit  intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the sheer number of loans,  a total of 16 principal advances, was likely to have had 
negative implications  on Mr Gs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in 
the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding the complaint about loans  4a to 8b and QuickQuid should put things right.
