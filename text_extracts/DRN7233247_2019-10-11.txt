K821x#15complaint
Mrs W complains that Provident Personal  Credit  Limited (trading as Satsuma)  was 
irresponsible to offer her loans. She asks that it refunds  interest and removes  any adverse 
information from her credit file. Mrs W is represented by a claims management company.
background
Mrs W took out six loans with Satsuma between July 2015 and September 2017.  
Her representative says she was dependant  on short term loans and Satsumas  loans made 
her situation  worse. It says Satsuma  didnt carry out affordability checks.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld. She said it wasnt wrong 
for Satsuma  to offer loans  1 to 3. But it shouldnt have given Mrs W loans 4 to 6. By the time 
she asked for loan 4, Mrs W had been borrowing  from Satsuma for 20 months. She took out 
loan 4 in the same month that she repaid the previous loan and it was for a larger amount. 
Our adjudicator said this suggests Mrs W was reliant on short  term loans. 
Satsuma didnt agree and so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Satsuma needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs W 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
Mrs Ws income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest  that Satsuma should have done more  to establish that any 
lending was sustainable for a customer. Such factors include the customers  income  
particularly a lower  income   the amount of the loan repayments and the time over which  the 
loan is to be repaid,  and the number and frequency  of loans and the time over which the 
customer has been given  loans. Repeated borrowing can signal that the borrowing has 
become, or is becoming, unsustainable. There may even come  a point where the lending  
history and pattern  of lending itself demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I would also note here that Satsuma was required to establish  whether Mrs W could 
sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.
Ref: DRN72332472Mrs W took out the following loans with Satsuma:
Loan No Amount Date of loan Date repaid TermMonthly

1 £700 25.07.2015 13.10.2015 52 weeks £111
2 £700 13.11.2015 01.08.2016 52 weeks £116
3 £220 28.12.2016 02.03.2017 3 months £108
4 £1,000 15.03.2017 02.06.2017 12 months £166
5 £300 17.07.2017 06.09.2017 6 months £95
6 £1,500 06.11.2017 02.02.2018 12 months £249
When she took out loans 1 to 3 Mrs W told Satsuma her monthly income was about  £2,100. 
Based on the information Mrs W provided, its credit check and its internal models Satsuma  
estimated her monthly  outgoings as about  £1,400. Satsuma provided a summary of the 
results of its credit checks and I dont think this would have alerted it to any problems. I dont 
think Satsuma had any reason to think  loans 1 and 2 werent affordable or that further 
checks were needed.  
Mrs W missed or was late with repayments  for loan 2 in December 2015 and each of 
January, February,  March, April and July 2016. Satsuma was unable to take payments using 
its continuous payment  authority. Mrs W gave Satsuma reasons for each late payment and 
she made each payment  soon after the date it was due. But I think repeated  late payments 
could suggest  a problem, such as financial hardship.
But, Ive also taken  into account the amount of the loan (which was smaller than the previous 
loan) and that there was a gap of about  four months  between Mrs W repaying loan 2 and 
taking out loan 3. This could have suggested  to Satsuma that Mrs W wasnt  reliant on its 
loans. Given the amount  of the loan and Mrs Ws income, and that the loan would be repaid 
over a shorter period  than previous  loans,  I dont think  proportionate checks  would have 
given Satsuma reason  to think  it wasnt affordable.
Mrs W was also was late with her repayment for loan 3 in February 2017. She settled loan 3 in 
early March 2017. But she asked for loan 4 less than two weeks later. By the time Mrs W took 
out loan 4 shed been borrowing  from Satsuma since July 2015  shed had a loan outstanding 
in all but five of 20 months. And loan 4 was for a larger amount than the previous loans. Mrs W 
continued to borrow  from Satsuma without any significant breaks until early  2018. 
The information Satsuma  had about Mrs Ws income and outgoings  suggested shed be able 
to afford the repayments for loan 4. But I think Mrs Ws borrowing history should have 
alerted Satsuma to the risk that she was in financial hardship and reliant on short term loans. 
I dont think it was reasonable  for Satsuma to offer loans  4 to 6 to Mrs W. I think, based on 
the information it had, it should have known further  borrowing wasnt  sustainable. 
I dont think Satsuma needed to ask for Mrs Ws bank statements or other evidence  I think  
the information it had was enough for it to know the lending wasnt  sustainable. But, for 
completeness, Mrs Ws bank statements  show she had loans from a number of other short  
term lenders. Her account was overdrawn and she incurred fees for unpaid  transactions.  
So if Satsuma had carried out further  checks I think its likely it would have reached the 
conclusion that Mrs W was in financial hardship  and further borrowing wasnt sustainable.
Ref: DRN72332473I dont think Satsuma should have offered loans 4 to 6 to Mrs W. So it should:
refund all interest  and charges paid by Mrs W on loans 4 to 6;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove all entries about loans 4 to 6 from Mrs Ws credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Satsuma to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mrs W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order Provident Personal Credit  Limited to take 
the steps and pay the compensation set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 November  2019.
