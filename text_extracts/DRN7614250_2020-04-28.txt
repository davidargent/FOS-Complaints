K820x#14complaint
Miss S complains  that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA sought to recover a payment of 
nearly £700 she received when she sold a camera on eBay.
background
In June 2018 Miss S sold a camera on eBay. She received payment through  PayPal. The 
buyer however contacted Miss S and explained that the camera  was intended as a gift and 
asked that she send it to a different  address from that registered on the eBay account. Miss 
S agreed  to do this.
Several weeks later PayPal was contacted by the bank  which  had sent the funds  to it. Its 
customer had said, and the bank had accepted, that the payment hadnt  been authorised. 
PayPal said it was therefore obliged to return the funds. It asked Miss S to provide evidence  
that the camera had been  delivered.
Miss S showed that the camera  had been  delivered,  but not to the address registered  to the 
eBay account of the buyer.  PayPal said that, as the camera had been  delivered to a different 
address, Miss S wasnt protected by its Sellers Protection Programme. She would  therefore  
have to return the money shed received. Miss S says she felt threatened by a telephone call 
in which  she was told she would have to return the payment.
When Miss S referred her complaint to this service,  one of our investigators considered it. 
He broadly agreed with PayPal that it was entitled  to seek the return  of the payment from 
Miss S. He accepted however that PayPal  could have handled its call with Miss S better  than 
it had; he recommended a payment of £100 in recognition of that.
PayPal said it would  make that payment, but only if this service agreed  to record  that there 
had been no change in outcome in the complaint. Since that wasnt possible,  PayPal  asked 
that an ombudsman  review the complaint.
I did that and, because I was likely to reach a different conclusion from that reached by the 
investigator, issued  a provisional decision. I agreed  with the investigator that PayPals  Seller 
Protection Policy didnt cover the situation here. Ill set out the reasons for that in my 
findings. But I also explained that, because  I wasnt  minded to determine Miss Ss complaint  
about the payment in her favour, I couldnt  make an award in recognition  of the way in which 
PayPal handled  the complaint. I had no power  to do so. 
Neither Miss S nor PayPal had anything  to add, so Im issuing this final decision  as the last 
step in our consideration of this complaint.   
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The investigator agreed with PayPal that it was entitled to seek repayment  from Miss S. 
Whilst PayPals terms do provide a degree of protection to both buyers and sellers who use 
its services, that protection doesnt cover  all transactions.  Im satisfied that the payment 
made to PayPal (and credited  to Miss Ss account) was fraudulent   in that it was made 
without the authority of the payer. Theres no suggestion that Miss S was anything  other than 
an innocent victim, or that she could have known that the payment wasnt  genuine.
Ref: DRN76142502The usual position where someone  receives  a fraudulent payment (even innocently,  as 
happened here) is that they are not entitled  to keep the money.  PayPals Seller Protection 
Policy provides some exceptions to that position,  but only for certain types  of transactions  
and only if certain conditions are met. Its Seller Protection Policy includes, at section 6c: For 
tangible items, post the item to the shipping address on the Transaction Details  page. If the 
item is delivered in person or if the payment recipient posts the item to a different address 
(for example, if the buyer asks that you send to another address on the basis that it is a 
work address or a gift address) then you will not be eligible for re-imbursement under the 
terms of the programme.
Unfortunately for Miss S, she did agree to send the camera  to a different address, and so the 
seller protection  wasnt available. In other  words,  the usual position applied  namely, that 
Miss S couldnt keep  the fraudulent payment. For that reason, it wouldnt be fair to make  an 
award that had the effect of shifting that risk back to PayPal.
I turn then to the investigators recommendation that PayPal pay Miss S £100 in respect of
its handling of her complaint.
The rules  under which the ombudsman service operates  are set out in the Dispute 
Resolution (or DISP)  section of Financial  Conduct Authoritys Handbook. DISP3.7 deals  with 
the awards an ombudsman can make, and includes,  at DISP3.7.1:
Where a complaint  is determined  in favour  of the complainant, the Ombudsman's
determination may include one or more of the following:
(1) a money award  against the respondent; 
DISP3.7.2 explains that a money award can include compensation  for pain and suffering, or 
distress or inconvenience. 
I can therefore make an award  in respect  of PayPals  handling  of Miss Ss concerns, but only 
if I determine the underlying complaint about a financial service  in her favour. The underlying  
complaint here is about the payment to Miss Ss PayPal account and PayPals decision to 
reverse it. But, for the reasons Ive explained, Im not determining that complaint in Miss Ss 
favour. It follows  that I cant make an award in respect of PayPals handling of the complaint, 
since a complaint about complaint handling isnt itself a complaint about  a financial service.   
I accept that Miss S has been  the victim of a fraud  here, and shes lost out as a result. And 
Ive no doubt as well that shes found these events very distressing; its possible too that 
PayPals actions havent helped. But, for the reasons Ive explained, I dont believe that 
PayPal treated Miss S unfairly  in reversing the payment she received and seeking  payment 
from her. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to do anything  further  
to resolve Miss Ss complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im 
required to ask Miss S to accept or reject my decision before 28 May 2020.
