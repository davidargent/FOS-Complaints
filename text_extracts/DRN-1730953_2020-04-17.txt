The complaint
Mr M complains about the service provided by Bank of Scotland plc (trading as Halifax) 
when investigating a disputed transaction. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I won't repeat them again 
here. Instead I'll focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons: 
Halifax's final response dated 23 May 2019 accepts that Mr M was given incorrect 
information about whether an investigation had been completed and refund issued. 
Halifax has paid Mr M £150 and apologised for the service provided and errors 
made. Taking everything he's told us into account, I'm satisfied £150 fairly reflects 
the impact of Halifax's error on Mr M. 
Halifax later paid Mr M £72 to cover his call costs. Whilst the service provided should 
have been better, the disputed transaction amount was credited to Mr M's account 
and there has been no financial loss. 
As I'm satisfied Halifax took reasonable steps to resolve Mr M's concerns and has 
dealt with his complaint fairly, I'm not telling it to do anything else. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint because the business has already paid a 
settlement that is fair and reasonable. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 May 2020.
