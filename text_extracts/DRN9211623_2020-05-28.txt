K821x#15complaint
Mrs S, Mr S and Mr C complain on behalf of the residents association of freeholders of the 
building where  they live, B, about  Allianz  Insurance Plcs increases in the cost of renewing 
their building insurance policy. 
background
For the purposes of the party bringing this complaint  I will just refer to Mrs S. Bs policy was 
taken out 2015 and renewed in 2016.  A claim was made by Mrs S in 2016  which  was dealt  
with by Allianz. In 2017 Bs premium  increased significantly and the residents complained  to 
Allianz about this and the 2018 premium increase. 
Mrs S previously complained to our service about  Allianzs mishandling of her claim, and this 
was upheld. She said as a consequence of her claim  and another  claim on the policy Allianz 
increased the premium  by over 70% over a two-year period. Allianz said it had increased the 
premium by only 2% in 2018. Mrs S said Allianz has miscalculated the percentage rise and 
this huge increase must be an error. 
In response Allianz  said the premium wasnt affected by its handling of the claim or repair 
costs. It said its premium  calculation was based  on a number of factors,  including  the loss 
history  the amount paid out in claims for the policyholder relative to the premium paid. It 
said the reasons  for the increased premium were  justifiable and the premium was correct. 
Mrs S said the residents  hadnt questioned the repair costs. They had complained  about the 
delays and consequent prolonged requirement for alternative accommodation  and the 
number of contractors  involved in the work. She said Allianz  had incurred unnecessary costs 
and she thought this had caused it to apply the large increases to Bs premiums.
The investigator said the 2018  premium  increased 5.8%, not 2% as Allianz had said but he 
thought this was reasonable.  He said between 2016 and 2017 Insurance Premium Tax (IPT)  
increased from 9.5% to 12%. He thought the 2017 increase was well over 50% and Allianz  
had only partly explained this as the cost of the claim  rising  significantly and the increasing  
loss ratio.  He said even  if some claim costs were  avoidable, the loss ratio would still have 
risen significantly  by the time of the 2017 renewal. He asked Allianz about the factors that 
influenced the increases but said this information  hadnt been provided. He said some 
insurers take into account the amount spent  on claims, or the loss ratio  and so a higher 
spend will result  in a higher  premium. But he couldnt be satisfied that the 2017 premium 
increase was fair and so recommended the complaint be upheld. 
The investigator said an estimate should be made for what  2017s premium shouldve  been, 
and the difference refunded to B. He thought that Allianzs subsequent increase of 5.8% was 
reasonable and so should be applied to arrive at a fair premium for 2017.  He said the 5.8% 
increase in 2018 should then be applied to the 2017 estimate to determine  what  the 
premium should have been in 2018.  He said this should be repeated for 2019 and the 
differences refunded. He said the 2016 premium was £4,303.43 (excluding IPT), a 5.8% 
increase would mean a 2017  premium  of £4,553.03 + IPT at 12% = £5,099.39. The 
difference with what B actually paid (£7,516.32) is £2,416.93 and this should  be refunded. In 
2018 B paid £7,954.24. The estimated 2017  premium plus 5.8% = £5,395.15 and the 
difference of £2,559.09 should be refunded.  He said the same approach can apply for 2019  
but because these are estimates it wouldnt be fair to add interest or compensation. 
Ref: DRN92116232Mrs S accepted the investigators recommendation. Allianz didnt. It said Bs brokers could 
have sought other arrangements  in 2016 and 2017, but had negotiated and then accepted  
the premiums. Allianz said the rate for Bs type of policy doesnt come from a set structure, 
lots of factors drive premiums including the type of building,  area,  and claims. It said claims 
inflation across the market had run at about  8 -10% for residential blocks of flats claims. It 
said the premiums included commissions, and so any refund would include this too.
Allianz said the rate before 2016 was generated by the policy being on a large portfolio and 
so when it moved to just Bs risk it no longer  benefited from size discounts.  It said in 2018 it 
applied a small increase,  which was lower than normal, but was fair because the of increase 
in 2017 was unusual, but said it reflected  the claims experience and the previous low rate of 
the policy before 2016. Allianz  requested an ombudsman review the complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs S said that Allianz had unfairly  increased  Bs premiums at renewal because  of a claim it 
mishandled. Allianz  said that the insurance  market is competitive and if Bs residents didnt 
like the increased  renewal premiums they could have put their business elsewhere. 
Our service doesnt regulate financial businesses, that is the role of the Financial Conduct 
Authority. And so, we won't usually make any judgements  about  the way an insurer chooses 
to assess risk, the risk assessments  it makes  - or the premium  it charges to cover certain 
risks. It's not unusual  for the price of an insurance  policy to increase at renewal. Sometimes 
this may be a general increase in line with inflation.  But other factors  that occur during the 
period of cover could  impact on the premium. Insurers constantly update how they rate the 
risk of consumers. And their rates continually change. 
Our role is to decide  if the insurer has treated the consumer  fairly in the charges it applies 
when a policy renews. To do this, we look at the evidence behind an increase in premiums  
to see if the insurer  has treated  the policyholder the same as others in similar  circumstances. 
Allianz has said that a number  of factors influenced  the increases to Bs premiums. We 
asked Allianz to provide evidence to show what factors drove the first large  increase in 2017. 
We also sought Allianzs assurance  that these factors would have applied to other of its 
policyholders in a similar  position to B. 
Allianz said the increase was reflective of the claims experience on Bs policy  and the loss 
experience it was seeing on residential blocks of flats at the time.  However,  although Allianz 
has provided general points, it hasnt  provided anything specific other than B wasnt insured 
as part of a portfolio after 2016 and so didnt  benefit from a discount.  This means  we cant  
say exactly why the premium has increased so dramatically and if the increase is fair to B. 
From the figures I have  seen, the 2017 premium increased by over 50% on the previous 
year. This level of increase following  a claim would normally lead insurers  to provide us with 
their key rating factors that changed  significantly between renewals. I have seen that the 
claim Allianz met for Mrs S cost over £100,000. I would  expect  this to affect the loss ratio, 
but I need to see how these factors contributed to the premium  increase and the even  
spread of this impact  for other policyholders. The information can be in the form of a loading  
per claim and/or  claim type and/or value, or a loading for loss ratio.   
Ref: DRN92116233Allianz hasnt given much detail about what the impact  was of B no longer having its risk 
calculated as part of a portfolio, but the increase in 2016 was fairly small. Allianz has 
acknowledged that the 2016 to 2017  increase  was unusually  large.  I agree, and without the 
information we requested,  I cant say that Ive seen enough evidence to satisfy me that the 
2017 premium increase  was fair to B and consistent with how policyholders  in similar 
circumstances would  have been treated. It follows that I think Allianz  should  put that right 
and I agree with the investigator  about  how this should be done.
An estimate for what 2017s premium shouldve been should  be used to calculate  a refund to 
B between  this and what it paid.  I think a fair increase  would be 5.8%  which was what Allianz 
applied in 2018. The increase for 2017s estimate should then be applied to the 2018 and 
2019 premiums to calculate what  they should have  been, and the differences refunded to B. 
We have calculated those  figures as follows:  2016 premium - £4,303.43 (before IPT @ 
9.5%) a 5.8% increase  would mean  a 2017 premium of £4,553.03 + IPT @ 12% = 
£5,099.39. The difference with what B actually paid (£7,516.32) is £2,416.93 and this should 
be refunded for 2017. In 2018 B paid £7,954.24.  The estimated 2017 premium  plus 5.8% 
increase for 2018 = £5,395.15 and the difference of £2,559.09 should be refunded. I havent 
seen confirmed figures for 2019 but I think the same  approach should be applied. 
I also agree  with the investigator that because these figures are estimates it wouldnt be fair 
to add interest or compensation to the award I am making, and I havent done so. Allianz  
said its premium  increases included commission and it is open to Allianz to recover this 
against other parties as appropriate. 
my final decision
For the reasons  I have  given above, it is my final decision that the complaint is upheld. 
I require Allianz Insurance Plc to pay B for the unfair  increase in its premiums.  This should 
be £2,416.93  for 2017, and £2,559.09 for 2018.  The same approach should be applied for 
2019 to calculate the refund  for that year.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs S, Mr S and 
Mr C, on behalf of B, to accept or reject  my decision before 28 June 2020.
