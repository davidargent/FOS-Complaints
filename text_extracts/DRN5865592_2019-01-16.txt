K821x#15complaint
This complaint is about a payment protection insurance (PPI)  policy sold with a credit card. 
Barclays Bank UK Plc, trading as Barclaycard, upheld  held Mr Ds complaint and offered 
compensation.
Mr D doesnt think the compensation offered is fair.
background
Mr Ds credit card and PPI policy started in December 1992. In January 2018, Barclaycard 
upheld his complaint about the sale of the policy and offered compensation totalling £43.75 
(after tax).
In its letter,  Barclaycard said it only had the monthly  card statements for Mr Ds account from 
May 2001 onwards. To work out his offer, it made some  assumptions about how he used his 
account between  December 1992 and April 2001.
Mr D sent Barclaycard some bank  statements from this period showing payments to a 
Barclaycard account  to help it work  out a more accurate  offer. Barclaycard said it couldnt  
use the statements  to re-calculate  his offer.
Mr Ds representatives asked our service to investigate his complaint. 
In March 2018 one of our adjudicators wrote to Mr D explaining that he thought  the offer was 
fair. In response, Mr D sent in two credit card statements for the account from September 
and October 1996.
Barclaycard used these  card statements to work  out a new offer which  came  to £275.48 
(after tax).
Mr D still thought the offer was low and he provided  our service with further  bank statements 
from July 1996  and July 1998 as evidence to show how he used his account before May 
2001. 
So the complaint was passed to me for a decision on the fairness of Barclaycards most  
recent offer.
Having considered all of the available  evidence and arguments, I issued a provisional 
decision setting out what I considered  to be a fair outcome. A copy of that provisional 
decision is attached  and forms part of this final decision. In short, I thought  it was fair in the 
circumstances of this complaint for Barclaycard to take into account the evidence Mr D 
provided when  working  out an offer.
Barclaycard responded to my provisional  decision to say it agreed to work out and pay 
compensation in the way set out in my provisional decision. It looked  at Mr Ds offer again 
and the new offer came to £728.73 after tax.
Mr D responded to say he accepted this new offer.
Ref: DRN58655922my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has disagreed with anything  I said in my provisional  decision, I havent 
changed my mind that Barclaycard needed  to work out compensation in the way I described  
in that provisional  decision.
Im satisfied that Barclaycards  new offer is worked out in the way I asked it to. It follows I 
think the offer is a fair way to resolve this complaint.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ds complaint  against  Barclays Bank UK Plc.
I think Barclays Bank UK Plcs offer is fair. I direct  it update and pay the offer to Mr D.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 February  2019.

So the complaint has been passed to me for a decision on the fairness of Barclaycards most  recent 
offer.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.  
For Mr Ds complaint, the key question for me to consider  is whether or not Barclaycard has taken a 
fair approach  to working out his offer for the time where  there is no information. Having done so, I 
think Barclaycard should use Mr Ds bank account statements to work  out a more accurate offer. Ill 
explain why.
When a business accepts or we find that a PPI policy was mis-sold with a credit card, our general 
approach requires  the business to refund all the premiums  charged and any interest caused  by PPI. If 
the PPI caused any fees or charges, wed expect these  to be refunded along with any interest they 
may have caused. If the PPI caused the consumer  to be out of pocket, the business needs to pay 8% 
simple interest  per year on these amounts (15% before  April 1993).
For complaints  where there  is missing  information,  wed expect the business to contact the consumer  
to see if they have any statements  or information to show how they used their card or how much they 
were charged for PPI for the period where  there  is no information.
Ref: DRN58655924how has Barclaycard worked out Mr Ds offer
To work out Mr Ds offer,  Barclaycard made some assumptions  about what his monthly  balances 
might have been between December 1992  and April 2001. 
Mr D was able to provide two card statements from his account which  showed the following balances:
August 1996:  £449.93
September 1996: £1,641.61
October 1996: £655.70
(The balance for August was stated in the September statement.)
Barclaycard assumed Mr Ds starting balance in December 1992 was £298.37. It assumed his 
balance increased steadily up to his first known balance in August 1996 (£449.93). Barclaycard used 
his actual statement balances for September and October 1996.
For November 1996 Barclaycard assumed his balance dropped to £290.27  and stayed  at this amount 
until April 2001. 
After making these assumptions, Barclaycard worked  out how his balance might have looked without 
PPI. To do this it refunded the premium and interest caused by PPI each month. It also provided 8% 
simple interest  per year for the times the PPI caused Mr D to be out of pocket.
what I think Barclaycard  should do differently
For complaints  where there  is missing  information,  it is very difficult  to say how the consumer might 
have used the account for when there is no information. But if a consumer  provides information, Id 
expect the business to look at this fairly  when deciding  whether  or not it can be used to work out a 
more accurate offer. 
Mr D has provided statements from a current account  showing payments to a Barclaycard account. 
Barclaycard said it couldnt  use them to work  out a more accurate offer. But I think it should  use them.
For complaints  where there  is missing  information,  I think it would be unreasonable for a business to 
say the only information it will take into consideration  are the monthly statements from the credit card 
account where  PPI was sold if there is other information that could help. 
Some consumers make  payments to their credit cards from their current accounts.  So if a consumer  
provides current account  statements showing payments to a credit card, the business needs to look at 
this to see if it can be used. 
In this case, I think Barclaycard can use Mr Ds current account statements, because they were in Mr 
Ds name or in the name of a joint account he was part of. The payments  were made at the time the 
account was active and I think  they show  what his balance was likely to have been.
Also, the payments were  made to a Barclaycard account.  Barclaycard has not provided any 
information or screen shots to show Mr D had more than one Barclaycard  account at the time. If it 
had, it would make it difficult to say the payments on the current account  statements were  to the same 
Barclaycard account in question. So, I think its more  likely than not that the payments listed on the 
current account statements were payments towards the same Barclaycard account.  
The current account statements Ive seen were slightly  hard to read but I was able to see the dates. I 
think they show the following payments:
July 1996: £387.24 (This payment was listed on 3rd July but was for June)
July 1996: £995.94 (This payment was listed on 31st July)
Ref: DRN58655925February 1997: £814.66
June 1997: £814.89
October 1997: £1,804.54
May 1998: £590.41
June 1998: £329.01
July 1998: £1,757.44
After careful review, I think this information shows that Barclaycards assumptions arent fair ones to 
make in Mr Ds case. I say this because for credit card complaints, the PPI premium  refunded each 
month (and historic interest) is based on the monthly balance. So the higher the assumed monthly 
balance, the greater the amount of PPI premium  (and historic interest) refunded each month.
With the exception of the £387.24 payment, all of the monthly payments Ive listed above are higher 
than Barclaycards assumed  balances in those months.   
what Barclaycard needs to do to put things right
The question for me now is how Barclaycard should put things  right.
First, Ive considered how Barclaycard should work  out what Mr Ds monthly  balances might  have 
been before January  2001.
I have looked at the breakdown provided by Barclaycard  which shows how it worked out Mr Ds 
monthly balance.
Barclaycard needs to make  some different  assumptions about how Mr D used his account before  
2001. To put things right, first it needs to use the bank statements Mr D provided  showing payments 
to a Barclaycard account in 1996, 1997 and 1998.
I appreciate the bank  statements only show the payments, not the actual balance on the card in those  
months. But I think Barclaycard can assume that the monthly balance was the same as the payment 
made.
I say this because all the credit card statements provided from 1996 and the known information from 
2001 onwards showed  Mr D paid off his balance  in full each month. So its reasonable  to assume that 
the payments listed in the bank  statements  were payments to clear  the whole balance.
So this means Barclaycard can now use the bank statements and credit card statements to work out 
what Mr Ds balances  might  have been for five months in 1996, three months in 1997 and three 
months in 1998. Barclaycard  has now told us it has found the statements for Mr Ds account  from 
January 2001 onwards.  The balance  in January 2001 was £2,037.62.
So the question for me now is how Barclaycard should use these assumed  or known balances to 
work out what Mr Ds monthly  balance might have been for the months where no information is 
available.
Mr Ds PPI policy started in December 1992 and the first payment listed in the bank statement  is in 
June 1996. Barclaycard assumed Mr Ds starting balance  in December 1992 was £298.37. In the 
absence of any information to show otherwise, I think this is a fair starting balance.  
So I think Barclaycard should assume that the balance  increased gradually  from £298.37 up to 
£387.24 in June 1996.
From this point on, I think  the fairest way for Barclaycard to work out what  Mr Ds monthly balance  
might have been is to assume his balance moved between the assumed  or known  amounts in a linear 
fashion.
Ref: DRN58655926For example, the known  balance in October 1996  was £655.70. The payment listed in February 1997 
was £814.66. So Barclaycard should  assume the balance  increased at £39.74 a month between 
these dates. 
By doing this Barclaycard will be able to work out what Mr Ds monthly balances might have been 
between October 1996 (£655.70) and January 2001 (£2,037.62) whilst fairly taking  into account all the 
information available.  
The next step is for Barclaycard to use this balance  to work out Mr Ds refund for the extra  costs 
caused by PPI before January 2001. In its original offer,  Barclaycard generally assumed  Mr D didnt  
clear his balance before 2001.
When a consumer doesnt  pay off their balance  in full, they will usually  be charged interest on the part 
of the balance still outstanding. Because Barclaycard assumed Mr D didnt pay his balance off in full 
each month,  they assumed he was charged interest in some  months.  So that is why they have 
included associated interest in his refund. 
All of the monthly statements available shows Mr D paid off his balance  in full each month. With that 
in mind, I think Barclaycard should re-calculate Mr Ds offer and assume that he paid his balance off 
in full each month before  January 2001.
So before January  2001,  Barclaycard should refund the PPI premiums charged and 8% simple  
interest (15% before  April 1993) per year on each premium from the date it was charged to the date of 
the refund.
Barclaycard told our service  that it has found the statements for Mr Ds account from January 2001 
onwards. This means it doesnt need to make assumptions about  how Mr D used his account 
between January 2001  and April 2001.  
So Barclaycard should re-calculate the offer using our normal approach based on Mr Ds actual 
statements after January  2001.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  set out above, I currently intend to uphold Mr Ds complaint.
If Barclays Bank UK Plc agrees to work  out the offer as Ive set out, it needs to provide this new offer 
together with a monthly breakdown for me to review before I issue a final decision on the fairness  of 
the offer.
If either party disagrees with what Ive set out, they need to tell me specifically  what they disagree 
with and why before  the date I have  indicated at the start of this decision.
