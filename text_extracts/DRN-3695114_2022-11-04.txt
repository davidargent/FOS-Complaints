The complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA provided misleading information to 
him after he fell victim to a scam.
What happened
Mr M agreed to purchase a graphics card from an online marketplace. He made three 
payments totalling £640 from his PayPal account to another PayPal user. The payments 
were funded by his debit card, which was issued by a bank Ill call S. 
Mr M marked the payments as personal payments. The effect of this was to disapply any 
protection he might have received under PayPals Buyer Protection policy.
The graphics card never arrived and Mr M realised hed been the victim of a scam. He 
reported the matter to PayPal but it said that it couldnt refund him because it was satisfied 
hed authorised the payments and, as theyd been marked as personal payments, they 
werent covered under its Buyer Protection policy. PayPal did say, however, that his bank 
might be able to recover his money by way of a chargeback. 
Mr M says that, as a result of this advice, he had to visit a branch of S on several occasions 
 as he received conflicting information from the bank and PayPal about whether it could 
help. He says that PayPal informed him that his money was on hold and there was no 
reason for S not to cooperate. Eventually PayPal said that it couldnt help him after all.
 
Mr M complained but PayPal said that it hadnt made a mistake. He referred the matter to 
our service and one of our investigators upheld his complaint in part. The investigator 
thought that PayPal hadnt made a mistake in declining to refund the payments in line with 
its User Agreement and was satisfied that Mr Ms money had already been withdrawn from 
the recipients account by the time the fraud was reported. 
The investigator did, however, think that PayPal should pay compensation to Mr M. The 
investigator could see that PayPal had mis-advised Mr M to approach his bank on one 
occasion and appears to generally accept what Mr M has said about the service PayPal 
provided. They were of the view that PayPal was therefore responsible for the inconvenience 
this caused, so they recommended it pay £150 compensation. 
 
PayPal agreed, but Mr M didnt. He said that more compensation is warranted, given that he 
had to take time out of work to visit the branch on more than one occasion and that PayPals 
promises that the money was on hold got his hopes up of getting it back. He asked that the 
investigator contact PayPal again for further evidence, such as correspondence, that would 
show that he was misled by it. PayPal werent able to provide any further information, so the 
case was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear Mr M lost money as a result of a scam but, having considered this matter 
carefully, I think that the compensation that PayPal have agreed to pay is a fair way to settle 
this complaint. Ill explain why.
Im satisfied there is no basis for asking PayPal to refund the payments in dispute. The 
starting point in law is that Mr M is responsible for transactions hes carried out himself. Its 
also accepted that Mr M marked the payments as personal payments and therefore he is 
afforded no protection under PayPals Buyer Protection policy. Neither is there anything 
about the transactions that could have reasonably given PayPal cause for concern that Mr M 
was at risk of financial harm from fraud. So, it didnt make a mistake by allowing the 
payments to proceed without being challenged. 
Ive also seen evidence from PayPal that Mr Ms money was withdrawn from the recipient 
account on the same day it was credited and before Mr M reported the matter. That means it 
couldnt have been recovered by PayPal.
Other than an email from PayPal suggesting that he should contact his bank, theres little 
evidence of the communication between Mr M and PayPal, but theres also no reason to 
doubt Mr Ms version of events and its clear that he contacted S on a number of occasions 
about what happened. So, I dont think it is necessary for me to obtain further evidence from 
PayPal and neither does a lack of that evidence count against Mr M. 
PayPal has not provided any explanation for why they directed Mr M back to his bank. My 
understanding is that a chargeback on the basis that goods werent provided would never be 
successful in these circumstances as a personal payment is treated as a transfer of funds, 
rather than a purchase of goods (and theres no dispute that PayPal did transfer funds on Mr 
Ms behalf). Also, given that Mr Ms money had already been withdrawn from the recipient 
account, it doesnt appear it was ever held by PayPal. So, Im satisfied that PayPal made an 
error in both suggesting a chargeback and telling Mr M that the money in the recipient 
account was on hold. Neither of these points have really been disputed by PayPal. 
What is in dispute is the impact that PayPals errors have had on Mr M. I agree that, by 
telling Mr M that the money was on hold, PayPal unfairly increased his hope of recovery. I 
also accept that he was caused some inconvenience by having to contact S and PayPal 
unnecessarily on a number of occasions. But, I think Mr M could have attempted to resolve 
this matter with S over the phone, rather than by taking time out of his working day to visit a 
branch. Overall, I think £150 compensation fairly reflects the distress and inconvenience 
caused to Mr M.
My final decision
I uphold in part this complaint and instruct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to pay Mr M 
£150 compensation.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2022.
