The complaint
Mr G is unhappy National Westminster Bank Plc (Natwest) didnt do more to prevent him 
from being the victim of a scam.
What happened
The circumstances of the complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont go into too 
much detail here. In June 2018 Mr G joined a betting syndicate. He went into branch and 
transferred £1,000 from his NatWest account to the syndicates bank account which was 
held with another bank. Around a month later, he transferred a further £9,000 to the 
syndicate using his online banking.
In February 2019 Mr G was informed by appointed official receivers that they were closing 
down the syndicate. They asked Mr G to register details of the amount he was owed. Shortly 
after this, Mr G reported to NatWest hed been the victim of a scam and asked it to help him 
recover his money. 
NatWest doesnt appear to have taken any further action until August 2019 when Mr G 
contacted it for an update. It responded in September 2019 to apologise for the lack of 
response but said there was nothing more it could do for him.
Mr G brought the complaint to our service. He said that NatWest, along with other banks, 
has allowed the individuals running the syndicate, who he considers fraudsters, to move 
millions of pounds through its bank. He felt it was clear it wasnt carrying out proper due 
diligence in protecting its customers against financial crime so it was to blame for the loss of 
his money.
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. They said that:
We could only consider NatWests obligations in relation to Mr Gs own account, not 
how it monitored its accounts generally.
They thought the second payment Mr G made to the syndicate was significantly 
unusual and NatWest shouldve intervened and asked him more about this before 
processing it. But, as there was nothing to suggest the syndicate was a scam at the 
time the payment was made, they didnt think any intervention from NatWest 
wouldve likely prevented the payment being made.
They could see NatWest hadnt acted as they wouldve expected in trying to retrieve 
the funds when Mr G reported the fraud, but as the recipient had already declared 
bankruptcy they felt NatWest wouldnt have likely been able to retrieve the funds 
anyway.
Mr G didnt accept the investigators findings. He felt NatWest had failed in its obligations to 
him. As a result, the complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Gs complaint was that various banks including NatWest failed to adequately protect its 
customers from financial crime because it failed to identify the financial crimes of the 
individuals running the syndicate. He says the fraudsters managed to move millions of 
pounds through their accounts and the fact NatWest didnt identify this was criminal activity 
meant it was responsible for him losing his money and is proof NatWest wasnt doing 
enough to protect him. 
But Mr G only has the right to bring a complaint against NatWest that stems directly from his 
being a customer of the bank. What hes described as his original complaint is about his 
dissatisfaction with NatWests banking practice and fraud prevention activity as a whole and 
this isnt something we can consider as part of his complaint. This is because our service 
isnt a regulator and doesnt police how businesses generally comply with relevant regulation 
and legislation. Our role is to consider individual complaints.
The crux of the complaint is that Mr G feels NatWest shouldve done more to protect him 
from fraud. And I have considered whether or not, in Mr Gs particular case, NatWest has 
acted as I would expect.
Should NatWest have intervened when Mr G made the payments?
Theres no dispute the transfers Mr G made were authorised payments. He made the 
payments himself under the Payment Services Regulations 2017, and the terms and 
conditions of his account, and so Mr G is presumed liable for the loss in the first instance. 
But Ive also taken into account the law, regulators rules and guidance, relevant codes of 
practice and what I consider to have been good industry practice at the time. As such I think 
NatWest should fairly and reasonably:
Have been monitoring accounts and any payments made or received to counter various 
risks, including anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, and 
preventing fraud and scams.
Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that might 
indicate that its customers were at risk of fraud (among other things). This is particularly 
so given the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years, which banks are 
generally more familiar with than the average customer.  
In some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, have taken additional 
steps, or make additional checks, before processing a payment, or in some cases 
declined to make a payment altogether, to help protect customers from the possibility of 
financial harm from fraud. 
The first payment Mr G made to the syndicate was for £1,000. And having looked through 
his account statements and the general usage of the account I dont think this was 
significantly unusual for him. He makes regular transfers of around this amount. And Id 
expect NatWest to strike a balance when carrying out further checks. After all, if it had 
blocked every payment it considered to be slightly larger than normal from leaving Mr Gs 
account this likely would cause him considerable inconvenience. 
But I think the second payment of £9,000 was significantly unusual and I think NatWest 
shouldve intervened at this point before processing the payment.
Would NatWests intervention have made a difference?Had NatWest intervened I think it reasonably ought to have asked Mr G more about the 
payment he was making such as what it was for and who it was to. And I wouldve expected 
it to use its knowledge of fraud and scams to identify any potential concerns and have given 
Mr G specific warnings and guidance around how to protect himself based on what hed 
said. But had it done this, I dont think its likely it wouldve uncovered a scam or Mr Gs 
answers wouldve given NatWest reasonable cause to refuse to carry out his transaction.
I say this because at the time he made the payment, the syndicate Mr G was paying into 
wasnt a scam. Or at least it wasnt a scam I wouldve expected NatWest to be able to easily 
identify or be familiar with.
From what Ive seen, it was a genuine syndicate that had been running for a number of 
years. And it seems it was later revealed that the individuals running it have been 
misappropriating funds and failing in their obligations to members. But this wasnt known 
publicly at the time Mr G was making his payments.
So had the bank questioned him, Mr G likely wouldve been able to provide genuine and 
persuasive answers about the syndicate because as far as anyone knew it was legitimate at 
the time. And whilst NatWest mightve given him general warnings about fraud and scams 
and how to protect himself against them, I think its unlikely Mr G wouldve felt they applied 
to his situation given his circumstances wouldnt have been similar to any of the common 
scams NatWest mightve described. 
I understand Mr G feels NatWest shouldve been doing more to monitor the accounts of the 
individuals that he paid the money to. But the account Mr G was making the payment to was 
with another bank and NatWest has no way of monitoring an account with another bank. And 
as Ive already explained, our service cant investigate a complaint about NatWests general 
fraud prevention activity across all its accounts, only its actions in relation to Mr Gs account.
Im sorry to hear of whats happened to Mr G. I can see this mustve been difficult for him. 
But when he made the payments he did, the syndicate he was paying into was legitimate as 
far as anyone knew. So I dont think theres anything NatWest reasonably ought to have 
uncovered or warned him of that wouldve likely exposed any crime that mightve been 
taking place in the background.
Should NatWest have done more to try and retrieve the funds?
Once NatWest was informed of the fraud Mr G said had taken place I wouldve expected it to 
contact the receiving bank immediately to try and recall the funds. NatWest didnt do this, but 
Ive seen that the recipient of the funds had already declared bankruptcy by the time Mr G 
informed NatWest of the problem. 
Because of this, even if NatWest had acted promptly in attempting to recall the funds as I 
wouldve expected, its unlikely any wouldve been returned. So I dont think its failure to act 
is the reason funds werent returned to Mr G. Overall, and for the reasons set out above, I 
cant fairly tell NatWest to refund the money Mr G lost.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 June 2021.
