K821x#15complaint
Mr J says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny lent to him irresponsibly. He 
says he was in financial difficulty, and he was dependent on short term lending, when Sunny 
approved the loans.  So he couldnt  afford  to sustainably make the repayments. Mr J thinks 
Sunny shouldve seen this and not lent to him. 
background
This complaint is about 29 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr J between  June 2017 and 
September 2018. A table  of Mr Js lending,  provided  to us from Sunny, can be found at the 
end of the decision. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. She thought that Sunny shouldnt have 
approved any lending from loan 6 onwards. 
Sunny disagreed with the adjudicators opinion in part. But it did agree to pay compensation 
from loan 16 onwards in line with what the adjudicator had recommended.  Sunny then 
reviewed the complaint  and felt it shouldnt have  provided any lending from loan 14 onwards.   
Mr J didnt accept either  of these offers. As no agreement was reached  the complaint has 
been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr J could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN61081372And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Js complaint. Ive decided to partially  uphold  Mr Js 
complaint in part and Ive explained why below.
Mr J didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion not to uphold loans 1 to 5. Because  of this 
I dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about these loans. So I wont  be making  a 
decision about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Mr J had with 
Sunny. So they are something I will take into account when considering the other loans he 
took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 6 to 29 because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  
history with Mr J, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which  Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Js case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr J was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr J had taken out six loans over about a seven month period. So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr J was having to borrow  
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loans  was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Js indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr Js first loan was for £600. The amounts  Mr J borrowed  fluctuated between £50 
and £600. I cant  see a sustained decrease over the period he borrowed from Sunny. 
So Sunny ought  to have known that Mr J was not likely  borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Over  almost all of the time Mr J and Sunny had a lending relationship Mr J was 
provided with a new loan within a short time of settling a previous one. And at times 
he had more than one loan running  at once. 
Mr J wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  29 was 
taken out 14 months after Mr Js first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr J had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr J lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN61081373the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr J borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Js ability to access mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 29 and Sunny should  put things right as set 
out below.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 6 to 29;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 29 should be removed from Mr 
Js credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Js complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 May 2020.
