The complaint
Mrs K complains that AvantCredit of UK, LLC (AvantCredit) lent her a loan she couldnt 
afford.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them all again
here.
AvantCredit lent Mrs K £3800 in December 2015, this is not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving 
the reasons for my decision about this loan. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The investigator concluded AvantCredit did not make a fair lending decision. I agree with the 
investigators conclusion for these reasons:
oAvantCredit says it carried out proportionate checks before agreeing to lend to Mrs K. 
It says it asked her about her income and expenditure costs. In addition, it carried out 
a credit check and verified Mrs Ks income using bank statements. It used the 
information it gathered to assess the affordability of the loan for Mrs K.
oThe loan was due to be repaid over 24 monthly instalments of around £231. When I 
look at AvantCredit calculations, I can see that, on the surface of it, it had worked out 
that Mrs K would have enough disposable income to afford the loan repayments. But 
like the investigator, on balance I dont think AvantCredit made a fair lending decision 
with what it had in front of it.
oI say this because when I look through the information AvantCredit gathered, I can 
see that Mrs K was having problems managing her finances leading up to the date 
that she applied for her loan with it.
oAvantCredit would have been aware that Mrs K had other credit commitments 
including credit cards and another loan as well as a bank overdraft. AvantCredit has 
told our service that Mrs K would have needed to repay around £810 a month after 
including the repayment of this loan. I can see from its system notes, that it queried 
with Mrs K her monthly income after the amount she disclosed was different from the 
verified amount its online tool had recorded. So, it obtained a months worth of bank 
statements and used that to verify how much monthly income she was receiving. It 
used a figure of £2576. I think based on the figure it verified using bank statements, 
the credit commitments it calculated represents a significant proportion of Mrs Ks 
income.
oIn addition, AvantCredit would also have seen that Mrs K was having problems with 
her finances within the information it gathered. It had obtained bank statements from 
Mrs K for the month previous to her loan application. It would have seen from this 
information that she was regularly going over her overdraft limit and was using 
emergency borrowing. On occasions she was over her emergency borrowing limit 
too. Mrs K also had a payment to a communications company returned twice due to 
lack of available funds and she was also repaying two payday loans only days before 
she asked for this loan. I think AvantCredit ought to have seen it was unlikely that 
Mrs K would be able to sustainably repay the additional repayment on this loan over 
the 24 month term when it could see that she was struggling to maintain her existing 
credit commitments. I think when I consider the significant proportion Mrs K was 
looking to repay in credit along with how she was managing her account and 
finances at the time, it is unlikely she would be able to repay this loan in a 
sustainable way. And, so in these circumstances with what it had in front of it and 
from the information it gathered, AvantCredit should reasonably have concluded that 
it was not fair to lend to Mrs K.
oSo, it follows that I uphold Mrs Ks complaint. AvantCredit now needs to put things 
right.
Putting things right
While I think AvantCredit shouldnt have lent to Mrs K, I think it will be fair for her to repay the 
capital of £3800 which she borrowed. So, to put things right, AvantCredit should:
add up all the payments made by Mrs K, if it exceeds the capital amount of £3800, 
then the overpayments plus 8% simple interest* should be paid to Mrs K, remove any 
adverse information recorded on Mrs K credit file as a result of this loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to deduct tax from the interest payment referred to 
above. AvantCredit must give Mrs K a certificate showing how much tax its deducted if she asks it for 
one.
My final decision
My final decision is that Mrs Ks complaint should be upheld, and I direct AvantCredit of UK, 
LLC to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 May 2022.
