The complaint
Mr J complains that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) was irresponsible 
to lend to him.
  
What happened
Mr J had two loans from 118 118 Money between July 2015 and May 2016 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 3 Jul 2015 £1,750 24m £138.84 1 Jul 2017 6 May 2016
With loan 2
2 6 May 2016 £2,508.25 24m £197.17 1 May 2018 18 Oct 2016
Mr J says that he was already struggling financially when he applied for the 118 118 Money 
loans and that he had a poor credit history. He says his disposable income at the time was 
not enough to make the repayments and that 118 118 Money didnt request any proof of his 
financial circumstances. Mr J says he had to borrow money elsewhere to make the 
repayments which resulted in further financial difficulty.
118 118 Money says it asked Mr J about his income and expenditure, the reason for the loan 
and his employment details. It says it used industry standard verification checks and that 
Mr J was asked to confirm that he felt the repayments were affordable. 118 118 Money says 
it also checked Mr Js declared credit commitments against his credit file and was satisfied 
that the loan applications were correctly approved. It adds that it accepted a reduced 
settlement for loan 2.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld. Although he was satisfied 
that 118 118 Money had carried out proportionate checks, he considered the information 
showed it was unlikely Mr J would be able to sustainably repay the loans. He recommended 
that any repayments Mr J made above the principal should be refunded to Mr J with 8% 
interest added, and that any adverse information about the loans should be removed from 
his credit file.
118 118 Money responded to say it felt it was unfair to uphold the complaint purely based on 
the amount of credit repayments Mr J had, rather than assessing how he was managing that 
credit.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 I need to take into account the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when 118 118 Money lent to Mr J. 
Its rules and guidance obliged it to lend responsibly. As set out in the regulators Consumer 
Credit Sourcebook (CONC), this meant that 118 118 Money needed to take reasonable and 
proportionate steps to assess whether or not a borrower could afford to meet its loan 
repayments in a sustainable manner over the lifetime of the agreement.
At the time of the lending CONC 5.3.1G stated that:
1. In making the creditworthiness assessment or the assessment required  a firm 
should take into account more than assessing the customer's ability to repay the 
credit.
2. The creditworthiness assessment and the assessment required  should include the 
firm taking reasonable steps to assess the customer's ability to meet repayments 
under a regulated credit agreement in a sustainable manner without the customer 
incurring financial difficulties or experiencing significant adverse consequences.
Repaying debt in a sustainable manner was defined as being able to meet repayments out 
of normal income while meeting other reasonable commitments; without having to borrow 
further to meet these repayments; without having to realise security or assets (CONC 5.3.1G 
- 6) or without incurring or increasing problem indebtedness (ILG 4.3).
(The Office of Fair Trading was the previous regulator and it produced a document entitled 
Irresponsible Lending Guidance which the FCA referenced in its consumer handbook. 
CONC 5.3.1G  6 specifically referenced ILG 4.3.)
In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
borrower of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender to seek more assurance, potentially by carrying out more detailed checks
the lower a persons income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the longer the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit is 
likely to be greater and the borrower is required to make payments for an extended 
period).
In addition, as per CONC 5.3.1G  4b: it is not generally sufficient for a firm to rely solely for 
its assessment of the customer's income and expenditure, on a statement of those matters 
made by the customer.
Bearing all of this in mind, in coming to a decision on Mr Js case, I have considered the 
following questions:Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks when assessing 
Mr Js loan applications to satisfy itself hed be able to sustainably repay the loan? 
oIf not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown? 
Did 118 118 Money make a fair lending decision?
Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Loan 1
When Mr J applied for his first loan from 118 118 Money, it asked him for information about 
his income and expenditure and carried out a credit check.
The checks showed:
Mr J said he wanted to use the loan for debt consolidation;
Mr Js income was around the £1,333 that hed declared;
His declared rental costs were £425 per month;
Mr Js credit file included:
oOne defaulted account from December 2013;
oA short-term loan with monthly repayments of £103;
oAn account with regular £50 monthly repayments;
oA utility account with monthly repayments of £43;
oThree credit card accounts with a combined balance of £1,008 and a 
combined credit limit of £1,200
118 118 Money used an estimate of 25% of Mr Js income for his other expenditure 
as the calculated £333 was slightly higher than Mr Js declared expenditure of £315.
Based on the above, and assuming Mr J made minimum credit card repayments, I estimate 
Mr Js disposable income was a maximum of £350, before making a £138.84 payment.
But, in answer to the first question, I dont consider 118 118 Money completed reasonable 
and proportionate checks when assessing Mr Js loan application. I say that because:
The loan needed to be repaid over 24 months and 118 118 Money needed to 
establish whether the repayments were sustainable for Mr J over that period;
Mr J would be committed to spending almost 30% of income on credit repayments;
Mr Js declared rental figure was unverified;
118 118 Money used an estimate for Mr Js other expenditure and a small change in 
the disposable income calculation would make the repayments unsustainable;
Mr Js credit file showed a clear history of using short-term loans so I think it would 
be reasonable to try to find out whether any recent loans werent yet on his credit file.With that in mind Ive asked Mr Js representative for further information about his financial 
circumstances at the time, but Ive yet to receive anything. Nevertheless, I can see from a 
later credit check that Mr J did indeed take out a further short-term loan less than two weeks 
before his 118 118 Money application. As the monthly repayment on the short-term loan was 
£175, I find this made the repayments on the new loan unsustainable for Mr J.
So Im satisfied that, if 118 118 Money had carried out proportionate checks, its likely to 
have found the new loan was unsustainable for Mr J and it was irresponsible to have 
approved it.
Loan 2
Ten months after taking out loan 1, Mr J applied for a second loan with which he also settled 
loan 1. 118 118 Money carried out the same checks again.
This time the checks showed:
Mr J said he wanted to use the loan for house improvements;
Mr Js income was around the £1,350 that hed declared;
His declared rental costs were £425 per month;
Mr Js credit file included:
oOne defaulted account from December 2013 which was satisfied in June 
2015;
oA £2,300 loan that had been taken out six weeks earlier with monthly 
repayments of £80;
oAn account with regular £50 monthly repayments;
oA utility account with monthly repayments of £32;
oThree credit card accounts with a combined balance of £2,635 and a 
combined credit limit of £3,200
118 118 Money used an estimate of 25% of Mr Js income for his other expenditure 
as the calculated £337.50 was higher than Mr Js declared expenditure of £250;
Based on the above, and assuming Mr J made minimum repayments towards his credit card 
balances, I again estimate Mr Js disposable income was a maximum of £350, before 
making the repayment of almost £200.
For the same reasons as before, therefore, I dont find 118 118 Moneys checks went far 
enough. Although I dont have any further evidence of Mr Js financial circumstances, I can 
see that he hadnt used the previous loan for debt consolidation and that, in fact, his 
indebtedness had increased between the two loans. His credit file also shows a continuing 
reliance on short-term lending.So, in summary I find it likely that another loan would have worsened Mr Js financial position 
still further and it was irresponsible of 118 118 Money to have approved either loan.
  
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money Limited) should:
Add up the total amount of money Mr J received as a result of having been given the 
loans. The repayments Mr J made should be deducted from this amount.
oIf this results in Mr J having paid more than he received, then any 
overpayments should be refunded along with 8% simple interest (calculated 
from the date the overpayments were made until the date of settlement). *
oIf any capital balance remains outstanding, then TFS Loans should attempt to 
arrange an affordable/suitable payment plan with Mr J. 
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Js credit file in relation to the loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to deduct tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money should give Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks for 
one.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2021.
