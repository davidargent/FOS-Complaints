The complaint
Mr L complains that Bank of Scotland plc, trading as Halifax, wont refund to him the money 
that hes claimed for a holiday. 
What happened
Mr L used his Halifax credit card in April 2019 to make payments of £660 and £198 to a 
holiday company for a railway holiday for himself and his partner that was to be taken the 
following month. He contacted the holiday company when he returned from the holiday and 
raised issues about two of the rail journeys that were included in the holiday and said that he 
wouldnt choose the hotel again. The holiday company responded to him and he provided it 
with more information about the issues that he had with the holiday. The holiday company 
credited £24.20 to his credit card account as compensation for a delay on one of the train 
journeys but Mr L wasnt satisfied with its response so made a claim to Halifax under section 
75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
He said that as well as the money that hed paid to the holiday company hed paid £132.10 
for train fares and £65 for an overnight hotel stay. Halifax didnt uphold his claim as it said 
that it couldnt find any documentary evidence to support a breach of contract and/or 
misrepresentation by the holiday company. Mr L wasnt satisfied with its response so 
complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She summarised the 
list of issues about which Mr L had complained but didnt think that there was enough 
evidence to show that there had been a breach of contract. She accepted that Mr L didnt 
enjoy the holiday as much as he would have liked to, but she thought that the holiday 
company had fulfilled the contract so she couldnt say that Halifax needed to do anything 
differently.
Mr L has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. Hes responded to our 
investigators recommendations in detail and has summarised his complaint as follows: "The 
train holiday was marred by the shortcomings of the [holiday companys] suppliers and the 
knock on effects that resulted on those two days of excursions, for which the holiday 
company abdicated any responsibility together with the holiday companys poor choice of 
replacement "optional excursion" (which was not optional), and also with the services of the 
hotel seriously affected the holiday experience defined in the holiday company's description.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ls complaint about Halifax, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company and that 
Halifaxs response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im 
not determining the outcome of Mr Ls claim under section 75 as only a court would 
be able to do that;
Mr L has described the issues that he had with the railway holiday - its clear that his 
enjoyment of the holiday was affected by those issues and that the holiday wasnt as 
good as he expected it to be;
he says that on one of the train journeys the train only had two carriages instead of 
four and that he and his partner couldnt find seats together and that on another train 
journey the train was cancelled so they had to wait over two hours for the next train;
I can see that those issues would have adversely impacted his enjoyment of the 
holiday but those issues were outside of the control of the holiday company and Im 
not persuaded that those issues are enough to constitute a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the holiday company;
the holiday company credited £24.20 compensation to Mr Ls credit card account for 
the train delay and Mr L said in his initial contact with the holiday company after the 
holiday that its tour manager had been excellent in dealing with those situations;
the invoice for the holiday said that an optional excursion couldnt go ahead because 
the railway wasnt opening that season due to structural issues  the holiday included 
a museum trip in place of that excursion but I dont consider that this was a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company;
Mr L has complained about a number of issues with the hotel but it was referred to as 
being a three star hotel  customers expectations of a hotel can be very subjective 
and whats acceptable to one customer may not be acceptable to another;
Mr L described the hotel as comfortable and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the hotel was misrepresented by the holiday company or that 
the issues with it about which Mr L has complained are enough to constitute a breach 
of contract;
I sympathise with Mr L for the issues that he had with his holiday but I consider that 
Halifaxs response to his section 75 claim was fair and reasonable in these 
circumstances; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Halifax to refund to Mr L 
any of the money that he paid for the holiday, to pay him any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2021.
