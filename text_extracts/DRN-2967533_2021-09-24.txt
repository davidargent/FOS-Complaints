The complaint
Ms W complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk will 
not communicate with her by post.
What happened
Ms W took out a Â£400 loan with MoneyBoat in October 2019. She said that she had been 
trying to communicate with MoneyBoat over several months by post and it had not replied to 
her letters. She said that MoneyBoat was refusing to contact her by post and would only 
communicate by electronic means. Ms W said she had asked on several occasions for 
emails and text not to be sent to her telephone but MoneyBoat ignored this request.
Ms W said that MoneyBoat made her an offer to repay the outstanding debt (principal sum) 
in instalments and she asked for this offer to be sent by post for her to consider but 
MoneyBoat refused to do this. Ms W says this issue is causing her considerable stress, 
inconvenience and worry. 
MoneyBoat said it was an online lender and wouldnt generally communicate by post (which 
had become more difficult since COVID restrictions as it was working remotely). MoneyBoat 
said that to make adjustments such as sending post (something it said in its final response 
letter dated 6 April 2021 is wasnt able to do at that time), would require additional work and 
costs and that Ms W hadnt given a reasonable explanation as to why this adjustment was 
necessary in her case.
MoneyBoat said that Ms W hadnt made any payments towards her debt and it hadnt 
offered for her to just repay the capital amount borrowed.
Ms W didnt agree with MoneyBoats response and referred her complaint to this service.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold this complaint. She said she hadnt seen any evidence that 
Ms W had provided a reasonable explanation as to why she wouldnt prefer to be sent 
information by email. She noted that MoneyBoat was an online lender and that the 
circumstances of remote working made certain functions harder. She said that Ms W had 
been made aware of the actions that would be taken if payments werent made.  
Ms W didnt agree with our adjudicators view. She said she wasnt required when setting up 
the loan to say how she wished to be communicated with and that it was her right to choose 
a method of communication. She said MoneyBoat was required to accept her choice of 
communication or the loan wouldnt be enforceable and should be written off. Ms W said that 
she had written to MoneyBoat over the previous two years and not received responses. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms W has said that if her chosen form of communication isnt accepted the loan isnt 
enforceable. It isnt my role to decide if a loan is enforceable, that is for the courts to decide. 
However, it is my role to assess whether Ms W has been treated fairly and, if not, then what 
MoneyBoat should do to redress this.
This case is about Ms W not receiving communication from MoneyBoat in writing. I 
understand that this is Ms Ws preferred method of communication for MoneyBoat to use but 
MoneyBoat is an online lender and it has communicated with Ms W in line with its usual 
practices. 
I note Ms Ws comments about not being required to say how she would wish to be 
communicated with when she applied for the loan. However, as she applied to an online 
lender I do not find it unreasonable that she would have expected ongoing communication to 
be electronic rather than by post. I also note that she did communicate with MoneyBoat by 
email at the start of the loan. 
In its final response letter, MoneyBoat explained that it used a variety of means of 
communication and wouldnt usually correspond by post (noting the additional work and 
costs of this and that it wasnt possible at the time due to working remotely). I do not think 
these comments were unreasonable.
MoneyBoat also said in its final response that if adjustments were required it would look to 
accommodate these. In certain circumstances we would expect a business to make 
reasonable adjustments to ensure that it was meeting the needs of a customer. This could 
include providing information in writing. However, Ms W hasnt provided any evidence to 
suggest that she is unable to communicate electronically and has used emails in her 
complaint with this service. Therefore, I do not find that I can say she has put forward a case 
that meant MoneyBoat was required to make this adjustment for her.
I note Ms Ws suggestion that she received an offer that then wasnt presented in writing. 
MoneyBoat has said the offer wasnt made and has noted that Ms W hasnt made any 
payment towards her loan. Without further evidence of the offer I do not find I can comment 
on this further.
Overall, I do not find that I have enough to say that MoneyBoat has acted unfairly by 
communicating with Ms W through its usual channels. I have nothing to suggest that Ms W is 
unable to receive or work with this form of communication and without further evidence to 
explain why adjustments should have been made, I do not find I can say MoneyBoat has 
done anything wrong.
While I know that Ms W will not be happy with my decision, in this case I do not find I can 
uphold this complaint.My final decision
My final decision is that I donot uphold this complaint about Evergreen Finance London 
Limited trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 October 2021.
