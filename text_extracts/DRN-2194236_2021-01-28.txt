The complaint
Ms R complains that Lloyds Bank plc wont refund to her the money that she paid for some 
removal services. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Ms R used her Lloyds Bank credit card in August 2019 to pay £5,248.80 to a 
removals company for it to provide removal services in September 2019;
she wasnt satisfied with the quality of the services provided by the removals 
company and some damage was caused to her belongings so she told it to stop 
unpacking and she and her husband then completed the unpacking;
she made a claim under the removals companys insurance for the damaged items 
and it offered her £1,386 to settle her claim;
she claimed a refund from Lloyds Bank of the money that shed paid to the removals 
company under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and the chargeback 
rules;
it made a chargeback claim but it was defended by the removals company because it 
had provided the services to Ms R and it didnt agree that the removals company had 
breached its contract with Ms R or that it misrepresented what she received  but it 
accepted that it had provided poor service to her so it paid her £100 compensation;
Ms R wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service but our 
investigator considered that the removal services had been provided and, while there 
was damage to the items, the insurance did cover the cost of the damage as per the 
contract terms  and she thought that the compensation paid by Lloyds Bank for the 
service issues was fair and reasonable  so she said that she couldnt ask it to take 
any further action;
Ms R then asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made but, if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
Lloyds Bank made a chargeback claim to the removal company but it defended the 
claim because it had provided the removal services to Ms R  so Lloyds Bank 
considered her claim under section 75;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Ms Rs complaint about Lloyds Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the removals company and 
that Lloyds Banks response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  
but Im not determining the outcome of Ms Rs claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
Ms R paid for the removals services, which included insurance cover, and the 
removals company provided some of those services and was prepared to complete 
the services - but Ms R told it not to complete the unpacking of her belongings 
because of the damage that had been caused so she and her husband completed 
the unpacking;
Ms Rs husband signed a service checklist, which identified some of the damage, 
and which said: The work has been completed to my satisfaction  Im not 
persuaded that it was unreasonable for the removals company to rely on his 
signature on that checklist as he was clearly significantly involved in the removals 
process even though the contract for the removals service was in Ms Rs name only; 
Ms R didnt use all of the removal services  but it was her choice not to use them  
and she benefitted from the services that the removals company did provide and the 
insurance cover that was included because she made a claim for the damage and 
received a settlement from the insurers  I consider that to have been an acceptable 
remedy for any breach of contract by the removals company which may have caused 
that damage;
Ms R says that the settlement didnt cover the full cost of the damage but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that there was a breach of contract 
or misrepresentation by the removals company in these circumstances that would 
justify a full or partial refund of the money that Ms R paid for the removals services;
Lloyds Bank has accepted that it provided poor service to Ms R and its paid her 
£100 compensation  Ms R clearly feels that she should receive more compensation 
than that but moving can be a very stressful process and Im not persuaded that the 
distress and inconvenience that she was caused by Lloyds Banks service issues 
justifies a higher amount of compensation; and 
I sympathise with Ms R for the issues that shes experienced but I find that it wouldnt 
be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Lloyds Bank to refund 
to Ms R any of the money that she paid to the removals company, to pay her any 
more compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Rs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms R to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 February 2021.
