K821x#15complaint
Miss A says Elevate Credit International  Limited  trading as Sunny irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about sixty loans Sunny provided  to Miss A between March  2015 and May 
2018. The first 25 loans are set out in a table in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
Miss A went on to take out another 35 loans  after loan 25. Each loan was for varying 
amounts of between £50.00 and £900.00. Miss As last loan was taken out on 11 May 2018 
and repaid 30 May 2018. 
Miss A complains  that the amount and frequency  of the loans shouldnt have been allowed 
and she has told us that she does not feel sufficient affordability checks were carried  out.
In its final response,  Sunny did not uphold Miss As complaint. It told her that it conducted  
creditworthiness checks, assessed her ability to afford the repayments which would fall due 
under the proposed agreement and it considered  how Miss A was managing other debts  at 
that time.  Based upon these checks it considered it was responsible  to advance credit. It 
later told Miss A that it would partially uphold her complaint and would put things  right from 
the time it gave Miss A loan 25.
Our adjudicator said that Sunnys offer did not go far enough  and upheld  Miss As complaint 
from loan 5 onwards.  He explained that loans 5-60 should not have been given. Following 
our adjudicators view Sunny revised its offer and this time it said it would uphold  Miss As 
complaint from loan 21. Miss A did not respond to this new offer. Another adjudicator then 
said that he did not think that this complaint should be upheld  from loan 5 but he said that he 
still agreed that Sunny should  not have given Miss A loan 6 onwards. As the parties are not 
in agreement the complaint has been  passed  to me to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss A could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN87099372the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss A could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss As complaint. Ive decided  to uphold this complaint 
from loan 6 onwards.  I will explain why.
When Miss A took out her first four loans it was early in the relationship with Sunny and I 
think the checks it carried out were likely proportionate and I dont  think there was anything 
in the information it had which would  have led Sunny to think  that Miss A was having 
problems managing her money or that the loans were unaffordable.  
When it gave Miss A loan 5, this time she borrowed  £400.00 which  was more  than she had 
taken out previously. But she had paid back the previous loans and there  were  gaps in her 
borrowing. And even  if better  checks had been carried  out and taking into account Miss As 
declared income and expenditure overall,  I cant say it would have appeared to Sunny that 
repayment of the loans  it had provided  were  unsustainably affordable  for Miss A.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss A, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss As case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss A was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss A had taken out six loans  within  seven months. There was a 
break in the lending  of just under four months  between loan 1 and 2 and some days  
in between the other loans. But I dont think,  in these  circumstances,  that the breaks 
are long enough for Sunny to consider that Miss As financial circumstances had 
improved significantly. But by loan 6 Miss A still hadnt repaid loan 5. So Sunny ought  
to have realised it was more likely than not Miss A was having to borrow  further to 
Ref: DRN87099373cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss 
As indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss As first loan was for £100.00 and loan 6 was for £150.00. But as I said loan 5 
was still outstanding when she took out loan 6 so she still had to repay that loan as 
well as loan 6. At this point Sunny  ought  to have known that Miss A was not likely 
borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in their income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Miss A was provided with a new loan within  days or weeks  of 
settling a previous  one and on many occasions Miss A still hadnt  repaid  her previous 
loans.
Miss A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan 60 was 
taken out almost 38 months after Miss As first. And it was for a larger amount. Miss 
A had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Miss A lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss As indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and length of time over which  Miss A borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss As ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6-60 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss A paid on loans 6-60;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
Ref: DRN87099374the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6-60 should be removed from Miss 
As credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss A a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Miss As complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 May 2020.
