The complaint
Mr W complains about the difficulties hes experienced using the online portal with Metro 
Bank PLC trading as RateSetter.
What happened
Mr W experienced issues when trying to access his loan account online. He found that no 
information was displayed on the account overview page and hat the screen was blank.
Mr W raised a complaint with RateSetter. In its final response, RateSetter said its technical 
team had investigated the issue and hadnt been able to find any errors or replicate the issue 
experienced by Mr W. It said the online portal was fully functioning and suggested that Mr W 
use an alternative device.
Mr W continued to experience the issues and brought his complaint to this service.
Our investigator upheld the complaint. He said he didnt think RateSetter had given Mr W 
enough support when he wasnt able to view his account online. The investigator said that 
RateSetter should pay compensation.
Mr W accepted the investigators view but said the issues were ongoing. He said that logging 
in wasnt the issue but once logged in he was unable to view his account information.
RateSetter said it could see that Mr W had been able to log in to his online account. It said 
the issues with Mr W not being able to view details of his loan was due to him using a mobile 
device and trying to access the account using Safari, which wasnt compatible. RateSetter 
said that it recommended that customers use a laptop or computer to access the online 
portal using Google Chrome.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive thought about whether RateSetter did enough to support Mr W when he experienced 
issues viewing his loan account online. 
RateSetter has said that when Mr W contacted them about the issue it suggested to him that 
he used the latest version of Chrome to access the online portal and recommended that he 
cleared his cookies and cache. It has also said that it made Mr W aware that he would need 
to use a laptop or computer rather than a mobile device.
Mr W has said that he has tried using different devices, but the issue hasnt been resolved.
Im not a technical expert and Im unable to say why Mr W is experiencing this issue. But I 
havent seen any evidence to suggest that the issue was caused by an error on RateSetters 
part, or that it was due to an issue with its platform. 
That said, I need to be satisfied that RateSetter offered appropriate support to Mr W when 
he reported the issue.
Ive reviewed the information provided by RateSetter. I can see that at one point, 
RateSetters technical team discussed asking Mr W to go into a branch of Metro Bank so that 
the issue could be duplicated and seen by staff. This wasnt relayed to Mr W and therefore 
hasnt been arranged. Because RateSetter didnt communicate this option to Mr W, I dont 
think I can fairly say that they did everything they could have done to try and help Mr W with 
the issue.
Ive also seen reference in discussions within RateSetters technical team to screen sharing. I 
cant see that this option has been communicated to Mr W, so I cant say that RateSetter has 
done everything possible to try and help Mr W with the issue.
RateSetter has said that it didnt receive a response from Mr W which is why these options 
werent communicated and/or progressed. However, I can see that Mr W was in regular 
email contact with RateSetter, and Im satisfied that hes provided all of the information that 
he was asked to provide. Im satisfied that RateSetter was in a position to take those options 
forwards with Mr W but failed to do so.
In conclusion, I think RateSetter could have done more to help Mr W with the issue. To be 
clear, Im not saying that RateSetter has caused the technical issue. But it could have 
provided better customer support.
Putting things right
To put things right, RateSetter should arrange for Mr W to screen share (this should be from 
a branch of Metro Bank if necessary) so that the issue can be fully investigated.
RateSetter should also pay compensation of Â£100 to Mr W for the distress and 
inconvenience hes suffered. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. Metro Bank PLC trading as RateSetter must 
take the steps Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 December 2023.
