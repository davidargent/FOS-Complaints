The complaint
Mr M complains that First Holiday Finance Limited wont refund to him the money that he 
paid for a trial membership of a holiday club. Hes being represented in his complaint by a 
legal adviser. 
What happened
Mr M and a Ms B entered into a trial membership agreement in June 2009 for the right to 
reserve up to five holiday weeks within the next 34 months. The membership price was 
£3,995 and they made a payment of £1,500 so the balance due from them was £2,495. They 
also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with First Holiday Finance that they signed in 
June 2009 for loan of £2,495. The loan was interest free and they agreed to make twelve 
monthly repayments of £207.92 to First Holiday Finance. The loan was repaid in November 
2009 and the holiday company says that Mr M and Ms B traded in their trial membership for 
another membership product which they financed using a loan from another credit provider. 
Ms B gave up her rights and obligations under those agreements in September 2011 after 
her relationship with Mr M ended so Ive dealt with this complaint as if she wasnt a party to 
those agreements.
Mr M wrote to First Holiday Finance in September 2020 and asked it for information about 
the credit intermediary for the loan. He wrote to it again in April 2021. First Holiday Finance 
says that it responded to advise Mr M who the credit intermediary was. Mr M then 
complained to this service and his representative wrote a detailed claim letter to this service 
in July 2021.
The letter said, in summary and amongst other things, that the credit intermediary wasnt 
authorised to arrange the loan which makes it unlawful, Mr M purchased the trial 
membership following a lengthy and pressurised sales presentation, the trial membership 
was misrepresented to Mr M, there was an unfair relationship between Mr M and First 
Holiday Finance pursuant to section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act, there was no 
evidence that a credit check was conducted before the loan was granted and the high 
interest rate was also an indication of an unfair relationship. It also referred to an overseas 
court judgment which commented on the unlawful structure of a group of companies which 
included the holiday company and it said that the holiday company, which was also the 
credit intermediary was in administration. 
This service forwarded Mr Ms representatives letter to First Holiday Finance and it issued a 
detailed response in which it set out the reasons that it didnt agree with the points raised. It 
also said that it thought that the complaint was made outside of the time limits for a 
complaint to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld. She said that 
she could see that the credit intermediary was authorised by the Office of Fair Trading at the 
time of the sale. She thought that First Holiday Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of 
the misrepresentation claim that was made under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act and 
of the claim section 140A claim to turn them down. She said that she hadnt seen anything 
persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr M.
Mr Ms representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has responded to our investigators recommendations in detail and says, in 
summary and amongst other things, that:
 she hasnt specified who she says the credit broker actually was;
 Mr M didnt know until he brought the complaint that he had all the knowledge and 
ingredients necessary to bring a complaint;
 the ombudsman service isnt required to follow the relevant law, guidance and 
practice but to reach an evaluative assessment of the merits of First Holiday 
Finances decision;
 no credit check was performed on Mr M before the arrangement of the loan; and 
 it cant be fair or reasonable that First Holiday Finance can benefit from a limitation 
defence, in circumstances where the holiday company has taken significant sums 
from Mr M and is pursuing him for further sums on a regular basis.
First Holiday Finance then confirmed the identity of the sales company that brokered the 
finance and provided its Office of Fair Trading number and our investigator provided that 
information to Mr Ms representative.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ms complaint shouldnt be upheld but 
for these reasons:
 we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
 Mr Ms complaint is that First Holiday Finance turned down the claims that his 
representative had made in its July 2021 letter to this service and he referred his 
complaint to this service before that letter had been provided to First Holiday Finance 
- but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies to his claims;
 Mr Ms claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im 
considering whether or not First Holiday Finances response to those claims was fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances;
 section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met); Mr Ms claim under section 75 is that the trial membership was misrepresented to 
him and that he wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to him - if the 
criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, First Holiday Finance would be 
expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
 the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
 I consider that Mr M could have made a claim to the holiday company or First Holiday 
Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him into buying the trial 
membership in June 2009 as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations 
would have been made and any loss would have been incurred as that was when he 
also entered into the loan agreement with First Holiday Finance;
 I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or First Holiday Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made until 
July 2021, more than twelve years later which was outside of the time limits set out in 
the Limitation Act so I consider that his misrepresentation claim is now time-barred;
 Mr Ms representative says that Mr M didnt know until he brought his complaint that 
he had all the knowledge and ingredients necessary to bring a complaint  but when 
he had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist him for the purposes of the 
Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are 
extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of 
action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr Ms 
claims;
 Mr Ms representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr M and 
First Holiday Finance and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
 the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
 First Holiday Finance has provided evidence to show that the loan was repaid in 
November 2009 and that the loan agreement ended at that time - so Mr M would 
have had six years from then to bring a claim against either the holiday company or 
First Holiday Finance;
 Mr M didnt raise his concerns about the authorisation of the credit intermediary with 
First Holiday Finance until September 2020, and there was no reference to a claim 
under section 140A until his representatives letter to this service in July 2021, so I 
consider that his claim under section 140A is now also time-barred; 
 Mr Ms representative says that it cant be fair or reasonable that First Holiday 
Finance can benefit from a limitation defence, in circumstances where the holiday 
company has taken significant sums from Mr M and is pursuing him for further sums 
on a regular basis  but that holiday company says that Mr M traded in his trial 
membership for another membership product which he financed using a loan from 
another credit provider so his trial membership has ended and the further sums that 
he's being pursued for relate to the other membership product; First Holiday Finance has provided the name of the credit intermediary and 
information about its Office of Fair trading licence and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the credit intermediary wasnt authorised to arrange 
the loan for Mr M in June 2009 or that the loan was sold to him by unlawful means;
 Mr Ms representative says that theres no evidence that a credit check was 
conducted before the loan was provided to Mr M  but the application form for the 
loan agreement, which was signed by Mr M (and Ms B), shows that they were both 
employed with annual incomes of £27,000 and £28,000 and that they were 
homeowners with a monthly mortgage repayment of £900 and I consider that it would 
have been reasonable for First Holiday Finance to have concluded, based on that 
information, that Mr M could afford to make monthly payments of £207.92 to First 
Holiday Finance;
 the loan was repaid in November 2009, less than six months later, and Ive seen no 
evidence to show that Mr M complained to First Holiday Finance about its credit 
checks or the affordability of the loan until his representatives letter to this service in 
July 2021  and neither of the letters that Mr M sent to First Holiday Finance in 
September 2020 and April 2021 referred to those issues;
 Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr M when it was 
provided to him or that he experienced any financial difficulties because of the loan 
that First Holiday Finance made to him; 
 Mr Ms representative says that the high interest rate that Mr M was expected to pay 
is also an indication of an unfair relationship  but no interest was payable on the 
loan;
 immediately above Mr Ms signature on the loan agreement it says This is a Credit 
Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be 
legally bound by its terms - if the terms of the loan agreement werent acceptable to 
him I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him not to have signed the loan 
agreement;
 the loan agreement also set out his right to cancel the loan agreement within fourteen 
days but Ive seen no evidence to show that he tried to cancel the loan agreement 
within that period;
 Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr M was unduly 
pressured into buying the trial membership or entering into the loan agreement or 
that the holiday company used unacceptable commercial practices against him  he 
didnt contact First Holiday Finance about any issues relating to the loan until 
September 2020 (more than eleven years after he entered into the loan agreement) 
and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained to First 
Holiday Finance about any such issues before then;
 Mr Ms representative has referred to an overseas court judgment which commented 
on the unlawful structure of a group of companies which included the holiday 
company  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
structure of those companies was unlawful;
 Mr Ms representative has also referred to the administration of the holiday company 
in November 2020  but the trial membership was for 34 months from June 2009 and 
Mr M traded in their trial membership for another membership product so Im not 
persuaded that the administration of the holiday company in November 2020 has any 
relevance to his claims;
 I consider that First Holiday Finances responses to Mr M and his representative 
have been fair and reasonable and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence 
to show that it has acted incorrectly in these circumstances; and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require First Holiday Finance to 
refund to Mr M any of the money that he paid under the loan agreement, to pay him 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2023.
