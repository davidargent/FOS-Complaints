K821x#15complaint
Mr T complains about the loans he had with Gain Credit LLC (trading as Lending  Stream).  
He has said Lending  Stream lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Between July 2011 and May 2017,  Lending Stream  gave Mr T 55 instalment loans. The 
loans were typically due to repaid in six monthly instalments. The loan amounts varied  from 
£50 to £900. From the information  provided  Mr T has repaid  loans  1 to 54 but has an 
outstanding balance on loan 55. Mr T stopped  repaying loan 55 and this loan has now been 
passed to a third party  debt collection agency.
Lending Streams  records  show the loan information which can be found at the appendix at 
the end of this decision.  
When Mr T complained to Lending  Stream  about  the loans, it didnt uphold his complaint 
saying that it carried  out sufficient checks before lending to him but that it made  a procedural 
error when  it agreed to lend loan 43, it said it didnt obtain Mr Ts credit  score before 
agreeing this loan.  As a result  Lending  Stream offered to refund the interest and charges of 
£9.60 that Mr T paid towards that loan.
Mr T didnt  accept Lending Streams offer and referred  the complaint to this service where it 
was looked at by one of our adjudicators. Our adjudicator thought that Lending  Streams  
checks went far enough before lending loans 1 to 5 but didnt think  the checks went far 
enough for loan 6 onwards. However, based  on the limited information time available  about 
Mr Ts circumstances  at they were unable  to say loans 6 and 7 were  unaffordable. Our 
adjudicator thought Lending Stream shouldnt have lent Mr T loans 8 to 55 as the borrowing 
pattern was unsustainable and the loans werent being used for a short  term purpose.  
Lending Stream disagreed with the adjudicators findings. 
Because this complaint wasnt resolved, it has come to me  an ombudsman  for a 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that loan 1 should be upheld and neither Mr T nor 
Lending stream  have disagreed with this finding.  There was a significant gap in the lending  
relationship between loans 1 and 2 and I think this gap was sufficient  to break the lending  
chain. Because  neither party has disputed the adjudicators findings  on loan 1 and because  
of the gap between when  this loan was repaid and when loan 2 was taken, I havent  
specifically looked  at loan 1 in this decision. My decision  will focus on the second  loan and 
continued lending  chain where the dispute still remains. So I will be looking at loan 2 
onwards in this decision. 
Ref: DRN43612352Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what theyre borrowing in a sustainable manner, 
without it adversely impacting on their financial situation. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ts income and expenditure at the time. With this 
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount, or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or  frequency  of loans 
the period of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing  is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Ts complaint.  These questions are:
1.did Lending Stream, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks  
to satisfy itself that Mr T would  be able to repay in a sustainable  way?  If not, would 
those checks  have shown that Mr T would  have been able to do so?
2.taking  into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  
pattern of lending increase Mr Ts indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.did Lending Stream act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Ts complaint.
Lending Stream says before lending  each loan, it checked Mr T income   which  it recorded  
as varying from £1,250  to £2,000. It checked his monthly expenses and this varied  from 
£150 to £500. It also said it checked Mr Ts employment status and obtained Mr Ts credit 
score. Mr Ts credit score  varied from 561 to 690. And based on what Lending Stream saw 
from these checks, it thought it reasonable to lend to Mr T.
Lending Streams  final response said that it used national averages  for expense categories 
as third party verification  of Mr Ts declarations. Yet it has not provided any detail 
whatsoever on how this verification took place and what  it showed in Mr Ts case.
Considering that this is information that Lending  Stream itself says it collected and it says it 
used to inform  its lending decisions,  its disappointing that Lending Stream has been unable  
to tell me what the data was and what it revealed about Mr Ts circumstances when he 
applied for his loans.
Ref: DRN43612353Lending Stream is responsible for explaining why any lending it approved was fair. Given 
that Lending Stream has maintained that all of Mr Ts loans were responsibly lent, it ought to 
know  and have  explained  not only what data it analysed, but also how it used and 
interpreted this information to make  responsible  lending decisions.
This service cant take it as read that any possible third party verification resulted in fair 
lending decisions.
Did Lending  Stream, each time it lent, complete reasonable  and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr T would be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would those 
checks have shown  that Mr T would have  been  able to do so?
Ive carefully thought  about what has provided and what  it has said.  
I think Lending Streams checks for loans  2 to 5 went far enough. Loan 2 was due to repaid 
in six instalments, the highest instalment amount was £64.80. Mr T declared his income  as 
£2,000 and his monthly  expenses as £150.  This suggests he was in a position to afford the 
loan repayments.
By the time Mr T was taking loan 3, he hadnt fully repaid loan 2 and so his maximum 
repayment he had to make during the repayment  period was around £130. Again his 
declared income of £2,000 and his declared  monthly expenses  of £350 suggest that he 
could sustainably afford to repay this loan.
Mr T was in similar circumstances at the times of loans 4 and 5  his income  remained  
£2,000 and his declared expensed were now £411. I can see that at the time he took loan 4 
and 5 he hadnt fully repaid loans 2 and 3 and so his repayments take into account the 
outstanding payments he had to make on the previous loans. So, for both these loans, Mr T 
was due to repay maximum  amounts of around £247 and £209. But given the level of 
income he had left over, I think he was in a position  to sustainably make  the loan 
repayments for both these  loans.
From loan 6 onwards, I would have expected Lending Stream  to look to build a clearer 
picture of his financial circumstances and independently verify some of the information 
provided. I say this because Mr T had been either borrowing or repaying a loan for the last 
six months and for each  of the loans he was still repaying at least two other previous loans. 
I think that may have  suggested that he was dependent on these loans and Lending Stream 
should have been doing more before lending.
Mr T hasnt  provided this service with information that would help reconstruct and 
understand his financial  circumstances at the time of these loans so I dont know  what better 
checks would have  shown  Lending Stream so Im unable to say these loans were 
unaffordable for Mr T.
However, Im concerned  that Lending  Stream continued to lend to Mr T repeatedly and 
based its lending  decision on similar information  from the time of the first loan without taking 
steps to widen its checks. Because of the limited  information, I havent recreated individual,  
proportionate affordability checks for loans 6 to 55. But from loan 8 onwards, I dont think  
that it is necessary  to check  whether  these  loans were affordable  for Mr T. Ill explain why 
this is the case in the next section.
Ref: DRN43612354Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ts indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which Lending Stream  should reasonably  have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. And so Lending  Stream should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further lending. Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ts case,  I think  that 
this point was reached  by loan 8. I say this because:
by loan 8 onwards, he hadnt  fully repaid his previous loans before taking  out a new 
loan  this meant that he was repaying at least two other  instalment loans at the 
same time,
17 of those loans  were more than double Mr Ts starting amount,
during the period of these loans,  Mr T borrowed an average of around £170 and was 
due to repay total interest  and charges of around £3,200 and in these circumstances, 
Mr T was effectively repaying interest  but wasnt really making inroads to repaying  
the outstanding  capital,
Lending Stream ought to have realised it was likely  his indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
I think that Mr T lost out because Lending Stream continued to provide borrowing from loan 
8 to 55:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time. Mr Ts borrowing was 
continuous for nearly two years from loans 8 to 55 and he was paying  substantial 
amounts in interest for access  to relatively low sums, 
the sheer number  and frequency of loans was likely  to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ts ability to rehabilitate  his finances to access  mainstream credit 
and so kept him in the market for these  high-cost  loans.
So overall and having carefully thought  about everything provided and whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this case,   Im upholding Mr Ts complaint about loans 8 
to 55 because the overall pattern of lending increased his indebtedness  in a way that was 
unsustainable or otherwise harmful and Lending Stream  ought  to have realised this. 
Did Lending  Stream act unfairly or unreasonably in some other  way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Mr T has said that Lending  Stream  passed 
his outstanding debt to third party debt collection agency and this has meant  he now had to 
repay more  than he would have done  had Lending Stream  not sold the debt on. 
While I appreciate Mr T being unhappy about  this, the fact that Lending  Stream sold on the 
debt doesnt on its own mean that it acted unreasonably. Its common  practice among 
lenders to sell on debts to other parties. However,  as I think  Lending Stream  shouldnt have 
given Mr T this loan, Im directing Lending  Stream to take steps to put things right with this 
sold on debt in the next section. 
putting things right  what Lending Stream needs to do
Mr T has lost out as a result of being  lent these loans and so to put things right, 
Ref: DRN43612355Lending Stream should refund all interest  and charges Mr T paid on loans 8 to 55;
It should also pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded  interest and charges 
from the date they were  paid to the date of settlement*;
Lending Stream may deduct the outstanding capital  balance on loan 55 from the 
redress sum but it must buy back the loan before doing  this,
if Lending Stream is unable  buy back the loan then it shouldnt  make any deductions  
to the redress amount,
the number  of these loans  means  any information recorded  about them  is adverse. 
So all entries about these loans should  be removed from Mr Ts credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending  Stream to take off tax from this interest. 
Lending Stream must give Mr T a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ts complaint in part and require Gain Credit LLC to put things right as set out 
above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 March  2019.
