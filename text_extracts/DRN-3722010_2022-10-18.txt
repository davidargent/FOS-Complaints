The complaint
Ms B, through her representative, complains that Morses Club PLC lent to her when she 
could not afford it.
What happened
Using information from Morses here is a summary of the seven approved loans. They are all 
for Ms B according to Morses records, but loan 7 was taken using a different customer 
number and follows a significant gap in the lending. So, it seems that Ms B was allocated a 
new customer number for that last loan.

After Ms B had received Morses final response letter, she referred her complaint to the
Financial Ombudsman Service. One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and the 
initial view was that Morses should put things right for Ms B for loans 4 to 7.
Morses responded to point out the new customer number and the gap in lending before 
loan 7. Morses also pointed out the individual issues surrounding each loan figure and 
disputed the uphold for loans 4 to 7.
Morses said it confirmed Ms Bs income using a credit reference agency. And factoring in 
her expenditure it considered that Ms B was able to afford loans 4 to 7. Ms B had a good 
repayment record.
A second adjudicator reconsidered the complaint and felt that loans 5 to 7 ought not to have 
been lent to Ms B for reasons relating to unsustainability. So, our adjudicator considered that 
from loan 5 the pattern of lending was unsustainable.
Morses responded again to say that there was a significant gap before loan 7 and the loan 7 
application was treated as the start of a brand new relationship. And on affordability it 
repeated much of what it had said earlier.
I decided to issue a provisional decision to give both parties time to send any additional 
evidence if either wished to. I gave reasons why I planned not to uphold the complaint.
Neither party has responded and the response date has passed and so I issue my final 
decision now. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about high cost, short-term and home 
credit lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our 
website.
Morses had to assess the lending to check if Ms B could afford to pay back the amounts 
shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Morses checks could have considered a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and Ms Bs 
income and expenditure.
I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been 
proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Morses should have done more to establish 
that any lending was sustainable for Ms B. These factors include:
Ms B having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be 
more difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Ms B having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long 
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms B coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid 
(also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms B. 
Morses was required to establish whether Ms B could sustainably repay the loans  not just 
whether she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money 
to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Ms B was able to repay her 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue 
difficulties and, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without 
having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised, 
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further then it 
follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
For ease of reference I have set out the provisional decision here in full. It is in smaller type 
size to differentiate it.My provisional findings dated 3 October 2022 
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and thought 
about what this means for Ms Bs complaint.
Loan 7
Starting with the last loan first, I agree with Morses that the 13 months gap in lending plus Ms B 
receiving a new customer number demonstrates that her application for loan 7 was treated as if it was 
the start of a new lending relationship. I consider that reasonable as the gap was significant.
And having viewed the information I have from Morses, I consider it carried out proportionate checks 
for loan 7 as the first loan in the new loan chain. And Ms B seemed able to afford the repayments for 
loan 7. So, I am planning not to uphold Ms Bs complaint about loan 7.
Loans 1 to 4
For Loans 1 to 4, Ms B does not seem to have disagreed with the second of our adjudicators views 
and so I do not think that loans 1 to 4 are in dispute. And I have not reviewed them.
Loans 5 and 6
That leaves the remaining contentious loan decisions for loans 5 and 6. I do not consider that there is 
any evidence of unsustainability at this point. I have no information from Ms B about her financial 
situation at the time. Her representatives submissions on her behalf are light and lack detail. There 
are no supporting documents.
I have considered that at loan 5 Morses likely ought to have made some additional checks. And I say 
this because when she applied for loan 5, loan 4 was a £500 loan, her largest one to date, which 
remained outstanding. And applying for an additional £200 loan which was going to have overlapped 
with loan 4 leads me to think that it ought to have done a bit more. And by the time Ms B was applying 
for loan 5 she had been with Morses for just less than two years.
And then Ms B applied for £500 which was loan 6. She had already paid off loan 4 a few months 
earlier and only had £70 left to pay on loan 5. But it was another relatively large loan sum and 
although the repayment record I have seen does not look as though Ms B was struggling to repay at 
all, still I think that by September 2019 (for loan 6), if Morses had not been carrying out any additional 
checks for loan 5, I do think that was necessary for loan 6.
Morses ought not to have relied only on what Ms B was telling them at that point she came back to it 
for loans 5 and 6. 
However, I am not able to review any of Ms Bs financial situation in and around the loan applications 
for loans 5 and 6 as nothing has been sent to us by Ms B to demonstrate her finances. Therefore, 
even if Morses had carried out the checks I would have expected it to have made for loans 5 and 6, 
I cant tell what it is that any Morses review may have shown to it.
So, on current evidence I do not think that I have enough information to be able to uphold Ms Bs 
complaint. I plan not to uphold Ms Bs complaint.
The parties responses to the provisional decision
Neither Morses not Ms Bs representative have responded to my provisional decision. 
I would not always expect a response from Morses for a non-uphold outcome. And we wrote 
again to Ms Bs representative to remind them of the reply date which was 17 October 2022.
In the interests of resolving the outstanding complaint I have issued my final decision. And 
as I have received nothing further from either party I do not uphold Ms Bs complaint for the 
same reasons given in my provisional decision. Those findings are repeated here and form part of the decision. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Ms Bs complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2022.
