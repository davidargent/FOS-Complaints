The complaint
Mr I complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) wrongly set up a direct debit 
instruction in relation to his account, without his authorisation.
What happened
Mr I set up an account with PayPal in December 2019. PayPal says that, as part of this 
process, he completed a direct debit instruction. It says that as a part of its process, the 
direct debit guarantee would have been put on screen for Mr I to consider before the 
continuing to set up the account including this instruction. It says that this instruction 
permitted transfers from his bank account to his PayPal account, which is a service he has 
used.
Mr I says that he does not recall setting up a direct debit mandate, or having the direct debit 
guarantee provided as part of the process. He says that he is particularly careful about direct 
debits, and that all transactions in relation to his PayPal account have been done through his 
debit card. He says that the operation of the direct debit has been without his instructions, 
and that this has unfairly cost him money. 
Our investigator thought that the direct debit had been set up at the same time as the 
account. They thought that the process was fair and that PayPal did not have to put anything 
right.
Mr I did not agree and so this has come to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to reassure Mr I that in reaching my decision here, Ive carefully considered 
everything shes said and sent us, alongside what PayPal has provided too. If I havent 
referred to anything in particular, thats not because I havent considered it  it just means 
that I havent needed to refer to it in reaching a fair and reasonable decision. Thats in line 
with our quick and informal role as a service.
Ultimately, the issue I need to decide here is whether PayPal acted fairly in using a direct 
debit to facilitate payments on Mr Is account. PayPal has said that its a standard and 
automatic part of an account application to give details of and provide a message about the 
direct debit that it will set up on an account. 
The records Ive seen all suggest that Mr Is application was subject to all the standard 
stages of PayPals process here. Its records show a direct debit instruction being set up at 
the same time as the account, which is what Id expect. Without that instruction, it doesnt 
seem likely that payments of the sort that were made to and from Mr Is account would have 
been made. 
Mr I says that he didnt consent to this, or authorise it though. If there was clear evidence 
that he hadnt consented to this, or hadnt been made aware that the direct debit had been 
set up, then it might be unfair that PayPal has used the direct debit for payments here. But 
neither party can show me exactly what Mr I saw at the time he applied for the account. So, 
where this evidence is unavailable, I have to make my decision on the basis of what is more 
likely than not to have happened, on balance of the evidence that I do have.
I havent seen any evidence here to support that PayPals usual account opening wasnt 
followed. Nor have I seen anything to suggest that there were any technical issues with the 
process that mean that the automated message about the direct debit wouldnt have been 
shown. 
Mr I has said that PayPal has taken payments in other ways to the direct debit too. Ive 
checked the statements hes provided and it shows that PayPal has also facilitated 
payments using a card too. But in any event, I havent seen anything to show me that 
PayPal shouldnt have allowed any payments here to go through. It seems like Mr I wanted 
these payments to be made and used PayPal to make them. In these circumstances, its 
difficult for me to say that PayPal has done anything wrong.
Then in considering what Mr I has said about this situation  I realise how certain he is that 
he didnt see any message about a direct debit, but the application was several years ago. 
So I have to consider that he may simply have forgotten the specifics of a process like this 
that involves a number of stages and took place so long ago. Even if I were to accept what 
he says, Mr I first disputed the direct debit and payments in April 2020 - several months after 
the account was opened.
Ive also considered Mr Is point around his need and expectation to have any messages 
around his direct debit read out to him because of his specific circumstances and needs. I 
realise that he wanted and perhaps expected this  but I havent seen that Mr I let PayPal 
know about this before opening his account, or during the opening process. With that in 
mind, I dont think it would have been fair to expect PayPal to have departed from its normal 
process, where it wasnt on notice of any reason it had to do so.
So, on balance of the evidence I do have here, Im satisfied that PayPals normal process 
was followed. That would have involved a message about the direct debit which I think its 
more likely than not that Mr I would have seen. It follows that I cant conclude that PayPal 
has acted unfairly or unreasonably by making payments in line with this. That means that I 
wont be telling PayPal to pay anything back to the bank hes mentioned, or to remove 
anything thats been reported on his credit file.
Mr I has also raised a number of points about enquiries and complaints hes made to PayPal 
about this matter. It does look like there was some confusion around whether Mr I had 
complained and then about PayPals ability to locate him once he complained to this service. 
That looks to be based around confusion around the correct contact details for PayPal and 
then around the details we received from Mr I. I dont doubt that this would have been 
concerning for Mr I who was eagerly waiting for a response to his complaint  but I dont 
think Ive seen anything in how PayPal dealt with this that means I could fairly ask it to pay 
compensation.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 August 2023.
