The complaint
Mrs N complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) defaulted her personal loan.
What happened
Mrs N had a personal loan from Barclays. It was originally for £7,500 and drawn down in 
December 2018. In March 2020, the balance was £5,324. Repayments were £171.88 per 
month. In April 2020, Barclays agreed a payment holiday (PH), with no payments made in 
April 2020, May 2020, June 2020 and July 2020. On 20 July 2020, Barclays wrote to Mrs N 
about her PH. No payments were made after that time. In November 2020, Barclays agreed 
to a 30-day hold on payments. On 25 December 2020, the hold came to an end. On 30 
January 2021, Barclays sent a Notice of Default with the arrears at £1031.21. In February 
2021, the loan was defaulted and later passed to a debt collection agency.
Mrs N complained. She said shed arranged a second PH on the loan from July 2020 to 
September 2020. The default was therefore unfair and should be removed. She said shed 
had an email from Barclays on 20 July 2020 which showed she had another PH. She had 
written to Barclays in November 2020, 23 December 2020, 29 January 2021, and 15 March 
2021 about what had happened but didnt get a reply. She said Barclays had made an error 
in not setting up the direct debit again to collect the repayments after the end of the PH. She 
wants the default and missed payments on her credit file removed, and interest and charges 
on the loan refunded from September 2020.
Barclays said theyd acted reasonably. Mrs N had PH for the four months up to July 2020, 
with payments due to resume in August 2020. Mrs N hadnt asked for another PH after that. 
On the email dated 20 July 2020, Barclays said that wasnt a confirmation of a PH extension 
as Mrs N had assumed - it just gave her more information about the PH scheme. Her 
account therefore fell into arrears. Arrears notices were sent to Mrs N to say that payments 
had been missed. Theyd received Mrs Ns letter dated 12 November 2020, but at that time, 
because of the arrears, they couldnt agree to a further PH  so they agreed to put a 30-day 
hold on her loan account from 25 November 2020. But  they thought they hadnt written to 
Mrs N then to confirm that and offered compensation of £50. Barclays said Mrs N couldve 
reinstated her direct debit over the phone or by visiting a branch  as she hadnt had access 
to online banking.
Mrs N brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said Barclays had acted reasonably. 
She said there wasnt anything in Barclays records to say Mrs N had asked for a second 
PH. The email dated 20 July 2020 didnt extend it but gave information about the scheme. 
Arrears had built up as payments hadnt been made. Mrs N had cancelled the direct debit 
herself in April 2020. She said Barclays sent Mrs N several arrears letters and tried to call 
her on 3 September 2020  and left a message to get in touch. Barclays had put a 30-day 
hold on Mrs Ns account in November 2020 and confirmed that in writing on 26 November 
2020. On 25 December 2020, the payment hold came to an end and Barclays wrote to Mrs 
N again and asked her to contact them. She said Barclays had reviewed Mrs Ns letter dated 
29 January 2021. But by that time, the arrears were £1031.28 and the monthly direct debit of 
£171.88 wouldnt have been enough to pay the arrears off. 
Mrs N asked that an ombudsman look at her complaint.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive seen that Mrs N has put a lot of arguments to us. Ive reviewed all of these, but its 
important to say that Ive concentrated on what I think are the key facts of her complaint. Ive 
also seen the correspondence between Mrs N and our investigator. So, let me say  we are 
an informal dispute resolution service which seeks to come to fair decisions where there is a 
complaint from a consumer about a financial business. We do this based on the facts of the 
case as we see them, having taken evidence from both parties. We dont take sides. And 
thats how Ive reviewed Mrs Ns complaint.
In April 2020, The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced guidance to lenders in 
response to the effects on customers of the COVID-19 pandemic. All lenders, including 
Barclays, had to put in place payment holidays on many credit agreements, including 
personal loans  to help customers who were affected. Customers could ask for a total of 
two payment holidays each of three months  whereby payments could be suspended. 
Missed payments would not be reported to credit reference agencies, although interest 
would still be debited to the accounts. This support was provided by firms up to the end of 
October 2020. 
The intention was to provide short term support  usually in cases where customers would 
be returning to work within a short period of time. And so  where a customers situation was 
that they were in longer term difficulty, then payment holidays under this scheme werent 
normally agreed.
I can see that Mrs N had a PH from April 2020 to July 2020  so made no payments for 
those months. Mrs N says she asked for a further PH for another three months. Barclays say 
they have no record of her request. Mrs N says she had a PH on her Barclays mortgage  
so it wouldnt have made sense not to have one on her loan as well. 
I looked at the email dated 20 July 2020   Barclays and our investigator say it gave 
information about Mrs Ns existing (and only) PH. As it said weve applied a payment 
holiday to your loan, we thought youd find it helpful to have a quick reminder of how it 
worksyou dont need to make your usual monthly payment during your payment holiday 
But for me, I think it could also be read to say that a new period of PH had been agreed  I 
think its ambiguous. So  Ive gone on to consider the other aspects of Mrs Ns complaint.
I listened to the call between Barclays and Mrs N on 29 July 2020. But this call is entirely 
about her mortgage payment holiday, and not her personal loan. There was one reference to 
her personal loan when Mrs N mentioned that she also had a PH on it -  so it does appear 
that at that stage she thought she had a PH on her loan also.
Mrs N had cancelled the direct debit for her loan payments in April 2020  Barclays showed 
us evidence she had done so. And so  no payments were then made to the loan after the 
PH ended in July 2020. So, arrears started to build up due to missed payments from then 
on.
Mrs N says she didnt receive anything from Barclays about the loan arrears. But Barclays 
showed us the letters they sent - advising her of arrears on 8 September 2020 (arrears 
£171.88); 29 September 2020 (£343.76); 29 October 2020 (£515.64); and 28 December 
2020 (£687.52). They also sent a formal arrears notice on 28 September 2020. The letters asked Mrs N to pay the overdue amount or call and we may be able to offer you a tailored 
repayment arrangement. So  I think it wouldve been reasonable for Mrs N to realise that 
the payments werent being made - and contact Barclays about it. But  unfortunately, she 
didnt.
We looked at Barclays call records for the period between July 2020 and the end of 
December 2020  and there are four calls between Mrs N and Barclays during that time (in 
addition to the call on 29 July 2020). Three were outbound calls from Barclays to Mrs N  on 
3 September 2020, 30 November 2020; and 1 December 2020. Each one asked Mrs N to 
call back. One call (27 November 2020) was unsuccessful. I listened to the call on 3 
September 2020  and Barclays left a message for Mrs N to call back about her account. I 
cant see that she did call back, as the call records show she didnt.
Mrs N wrote to Barclays on 12 November 2020 and showed us the letter. It asked that a 
further PH be agreed for three months  and says she believed she had extended it for three 
months previously. The letter says she couldnt afford the payments due to the pandemic 
and asked for a PH for three months from then on. Barclays then put in place a 30-day hold 
and wrote to Mrs N to say your account will be placed on hold for 30 calendar days. 
On 25 December 2020, the hold came to an end and Barclays wrote the hold on your 
account has now come to an endplease get in touch as soon as possible on xxxx so we 
can talk about our next steps. Unfortunately, Mrs N didnt call Barclays as theyd asked her 
to  as the call records show. I accept that Mrs N says she wrote to Barclays on 29 January 
2021  and has shown us her letter. But equally, Barclays said they wanted to speak to her. 
They wanted to do that to understand her situation  for example her income and 
expenditure  to see if and how they could help her. I dont think its reasonable to expect 
Barclays to have just agreed a further PH, or any other form of payment arrangement, 
without talking to Mrs N. 
And so  what happened then was that Barclays issued a Notice of Default on 30 January 
2021. This said the arrears were £1,031.28 and Mrs N should pay that amount by 27 
February 2021 or contact the bank and obtain its agreement as to how the arrears will be 
paid.if you are unable to pay the full outstanding amount within 14 days you should call 
this office immediately. It gave a number to call  but unfortunately, Mrs N didnt call. I can 
see she wrote to Barclays on 29 January 2021. Her letter said she hadnt had a reply to her 
previous letters  but as Ive said, it was clear that Barclays wanted to talk to her.  And so  
Barclays defaulted the loan. Under the circumstances, I think it was reasonable for them to 
do so.
I can see that Mrs N feels strongly about her complaint and has put a lot of arguments to us. 
But in the circumstances of her complaint, I think Barclays acted reasonably and Im not 
going to ask them to do anything here.
Barclays originally offered compensation of £50 when they thought theyd not written to Mrs 
N about the 30-day hold in November 2020. They subsequently discovered they had  but 
their offer still stands. If Mrs N wants to receive it, she should contact Barclays to arrange 
payment.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rsrules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs N to 
accept or reject my decision before 30 August 2022.
