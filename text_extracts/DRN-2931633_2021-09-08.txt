The complaint
Mr W complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) have been unhelpful in recalling 
a payment sent from his account with them.
What happened
In early January 2020 Mr W made a withdrawal of £3000 from his PayPal account to his 
bank account with another provider. Mr W accepts that the bank details where the payment 
was sent, had changed since his last PayPal withdrawal. Mr W says he  asked PayPal to 
help him recover these monies as his bank require PayPal to recall these funds, but Mr W 
says PayPal say they are unable to do this.  
Mr W says despite several attempts on his part, PayPal have been unwilling to help him and 
he has been without these monies for a considerable length of time and simply wants 
PayPal to help him recall these monies. 
PayPal says they have taken reasonable steps to locate the funds, but these funds are now 
sitting with Mr Ws bank albeit they understand that bank account is now closed. PayPal say 
they have done nothing wrong and there is little more they can do here.
Mr W wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the available information and upheld Mr Ws complaint. She felt 
PayPal havent provided sufficient evidence to show they had taken steps to recall the 
payment. Given that she felt Mr W had received poor service and instructed PayPal to recall 
the payment, credit Mr Ws account with £3000 and pay 8% simple interest since June 2020 
and pay Mr W £100 compensation for the poor service he has been provided with.
PayPal disagreed with the investigators view and stated they had attempted to recall the 
payment for Mr W and would like the matter to be referred to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator but for slightly 
different reasons. 
I can understand it would have been stressful and frustrating for Mr W to have his funds 
missing for so long and not knowing when and if it would be returned to him. When 
considering this complaint, I will consider if PayPal could have done more to help Mr W 
locate and retrieve his £3000, sent to a closed bank account. 
The first thing to say here is since the investigators initial view sent to both parties, I am 
pleased to say PayPal have since located Mr WS missing funds and arrangements have 
been put in place to have these returned to him.  That said, I still need to consider Mr Ws 
complaint that PayPal could have done more to help him during the time the funds were 
unavailable to him and whether or not any redress is due.  
Its reasonable to say that Mr W hadnt updated his bank account details with PayPal before 
the withdrawal of the £3000 was made, so I cant hold PayPal responsible for that. However, 
in circumstances where a considerable sum of money is mistakenly misdirected, I would 
expect businesses to take reasonable steps to help its customers to recover these monies  
and I cant say PayPal have here. I say this, as while PayPal told Mr W they attempted to 
recall these monies, from the evidence provided to this service this seems to be more of a 
case of a trace being placed on the monies in January 2020 rather than a formal recall. 
While PayPal say the monies should have been returned if Mr Ws bank account was closed, 
the fact remains it wasnt, and Mr W was asking for their help to retrieve it. From what I have 
seen PayPal have told Mr W he needed to contact his bank for the return of the funds, but 
he was repeatedly told by his bank this required a recall by PayPal at that time, but I cant 
see any evidence from PayPal they attempted this. 
When coming to a full and impartial decision here, I need to also consider some of the 
information provided by Mr W from his bank, some of which seems to be contradictory. I say 
this as on one hand his bank told him, the funds were recalled and returned to PayPal in 
May 2020 but in a later email dated 22 Jun 2020, it states they were unable to return the 
funds without a recall request. 
Despite the best efforts of this service, PayPal havent been able to provide evidence to 
show when they did receive the monies back from Mr Ws bank, only that they eventually 
returned this to his PayPal account on 2nd July 2021. PayPal also failed to inform both this 
service or Mr W this had been actioned, until it was asked for an update at the end of August 
2021, which goes to support Mr Ws complaint that they have been unhelpful during this 
difficult time for him. 
Its fair to say a recall should have been instigated initially by PayPal, rather than a trace of 
the funds. While I accept theres no guarantee such a recall would have been successful, the 
fact the monies have since been returned by his bank to PayPal in this way, suggests in all 
likelihood thats what would have happened at the beginning of the process. While it may 
have taken some more work from PayPal to achieve this - for example trying to telephone Mr 
Ws bankers or some other form of direct contact, I would expect a business, like PayPal, to 
have done more here to help Mr W, given the sum involved and how important it was to him. 
Its also fair to say Mr W had some responsibility in the first place to ensure his banking 
details were correct, so with that in mind, PayPal cant be held fully responsible for what 
happened here initially, and therefore I am satisfied the redress offered should reflect this 
and I support the investigators view that £100 is paid as compensation for the trouble and 
upset caused.  
As to the level of interest to be refunded to Mr W, I cant say its fair to ask PayPal to pay this 
from the date the payment was sent to Mr Ws bank in January 2020, given the initial 
mistake wasnt of their making. That said, Mr W had asked PayPal for its help and I am 
satisfied by way of compromise, after the complaint was lodged with this service in June 
2020, there was enough information available to PayPal to have arranged the funds to have 
been returned to Mr W. 
PayPal are unable to confirm when the funds where returned to them and if they had 
received the funds from Mr Ws bank as they have suggested. With that in mind, I am 
satisfied that simple interest should be paid to Mr W at 8% from 22 June 2020 as the 
investigator suggested and is a fair and reasonable settlement here, given we are unable to 
establish the actual date the monies were returned to PayPal. I will leave it with the investigator to establish if Mr W wishes these monies to be paid to his 
new PayPal account, the details of which he has provided this service, and to ensure, if not 
already actioned, the £3000 is returned to Mr Ws nominated PayPal account.
While PayPal will be disappointed with my decision, I uphold this complaint and feel this is a 
fair and reasonable outcome to the complaint.
Putting things right
I instruct PayPal (Europe) Sarl & Cie, SCA to refund the £3000 it holds for Mr W, to his 
nominated PayPal account, along with 8% simple interest on this sum, from 22 June 2020. 
In addition, they should pay Mr W £100 for the trouble and upset caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint.
I instruct PayPal (Europe) Sarl & Cie, SCA to refund the £3000 it holds for Mr W, to his 
nominated PayPal account, along with 8% simple interest on this sum, from 22 June 2020. 
In addition, they should pay Mr W £100 for the trouble and upset caused. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 October 2021.
