The complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA refused to refund an item he bought
that was not as described and also complains about how it dealt with his complaint.
What happened
Mr S bought an item online for £97.10 but he received an incorrect size. He says contacted
the seller and tried to sort matters out but without success. Mr S says he returned the item
but didnt receive a refund from the seller and so asked PayPal to assist. He says he
provided PayPal with evidence of the return of the item as well as tracking information, but it
said he hadnt provided such tracking information and so closed his complaint. Mr S would
like the money refunded and or compensation as well as his postage costs of just under £20
refunded.
PayPal says it didnt receive the requested tracking information and so closed the complaint.
It says Mr S made a chargeback in any event which meant it couldnt assist under its buyer
protection scheme. PayPal says it told Mr S he was eligible for a refund but needed to
provide tracking information to the address it gave him. It says Mr S sent the item to a
different address and so was no longer eligible for a refund under the user agreement.
Mr S brought his complaint to us and our investigator upheld the complaint and
recommended PayPal pay him £100 compensation for its poor customer service. The
investigator thought Mr S had returned the item and had provided PayPal with evidence of
that. And had shown good faith. The investigator didnt think it was Mr Ss fault the address
on PayPals records and the address, the item was sent back to didnt match, and that
PayPal hadnt made enough effort to engage with Mr S.
Mr S accepts that view but says the compensation should be increased. He says he has not
heard of the user agreement.
PayPal doesnt accept that view and says it did correspond appropriately with Mr S and told
him why it rejected his claim.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and said that PayPal dealt fairly with this
complaint and hadnt made a mistake.
I had no doubt Mr S bought the item in good faith and received an incorrect size item. I also
had no doubt he tried to sort matters out with the seller but without success. I accepted Mr S
returned the item and carefully kept evidence of the return. And I also appreciated why Mr S
sent the item back to the address he was given by the seller.
I said the key issue here is what PayPal did and I explained I couldnt consider the actions of 
the seller of the item or comment on why the seller didnt provide the refund to Mr S.
I looked carefully at the user agreement which I thought Mr S would have agreed to when
he opened his PayPal account. That agreement deals with disputes such as this and says
that a payment recipient may require you to return an item to a different address to our
record therefore we may determine  an item was not posted back to a seller.
I thought it likely that is what took place here, that Mr S understandably returned the item to 
the address he was given which was not the address PayPal had on its records and wasnt 
the address PayPal later told Mr S to send the item back to. So, it follows that I thought Mr S 
hadnt complied with the terms and conditions of the user agreement and so couldnt provide 
the correct tracking/delivery details to that address. In those circumstances I didnt think 
PayPal made a mistake or acted unfairly by telling Mr S that it couldnt continue with his 
claim as he hadnt provided the tracking information.
I accepted that Mr S did provide tracking information but not the required tracking 
information. And I understood why Mr S would have been confused by PayPals response as 
he no doubt thought it was referring to the tracking information of the returned item, but 
PayPal was referring to the tracking information to the correct address. I accepted PayPal 
could have been slightly clearer in its communication, but I didnt think that would have made 
any difference to the outcome of the complaint. And at that stage I said it was too late for Mr 
S to send the item back to the correct address.
I appreciated Mr S says he was unaware of the terms and conditions of the user agreement 
but that is not something I thought I could fairly hold PayPal responsible for.
I looked at the communication between Mr S and PayPal and I didnt think PayPals
customer care was inappropriate or poor. I could see it told Mr S he was entitled to a refund
shortly after he raised a complaint and told him what he needed to do to get that refund. I 
was also satisfied PayPal told Mr S some two weeks later it was rejecting his claim and I 
already explained that I thought it could have provided further information which could have
cleared up the misunderstanding about the correct tracking information. But I didnt think that
justified compensation and for the reasons I explained, wouldnt have changed the
outcome.
Overall my provisional view was that PayPal didnt make a mistake and acted in line with its
user agreement. I appreciated Mr S acted in good faith but that didnt mean I could fairly hold 
PayPal responsible for what took place.
Mr S has replied to my provisional view and says PayPal may have acted in line with the 
user agreement but hasnt helped him. He says he wasnt asked for tracking information and 
wasnt given the correct address.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the same view that I reached in my provisional decision and 
for the same reasons.
I have looked at PayPals records again and can see that it told Mr S to return the item using 
the address it then gave him and asked it to provide tracking information. So, Im satisfied 
that PayPal did give Mr S the correct address and told him it was rejecting his claim as he 
didnt provide the tracking information (to that address). I have made clear that I appreciate 
Mr S had already sent the item back to a different address by that stage but that is not 
something I can fairly hold PayPal responsible for. Overall, Im satisfied that PayPal acted in line with the user agreement and did tell Mr S what 
he needed to do to be eligible for a refund. I also find that PayPal couldnt take matters 
forward as Mr S made a chargeback.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 August 2021.
