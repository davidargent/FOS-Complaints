The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, have changed their terms and 
conditions without informing him and as a result have processed refunds on his account 
unfairly. 
What happened
Mr S sells items online and receives payment from customers via his PayPal account. Mr S 
noticed that, when refunds to customers were processed via his PayPal account, that 
PayPal were no longer reimbursing the PayPal fees charged to his account at the time of the 
original transaction. Mr S wasnt happy about this and hadnt agreed to any change in the 
terms and conditions that would permit PayPal to do this. So, he made a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mr Ss complaint. They noted that they had updated their terms and 
conditions to permit this and had sent notification to Mr S via the email address registered to 
his PayPal account. So, they didnt uphold Mr Ss complaint, although they did offer Mr S a 
payment of £20 as a gesture of goodwill.
Mr S wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint this this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but they felt that PayPal had acted in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of the account, so they didnt uphold the 
complaint.
Mr S remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr S has been able to demonstrate that the manner in which original transaction fees arent 
reimbursed to his account following a refund is inconsistent with PayPals treatment of 
another PayPal account he holds, where refunds continue to be processed in such a way 
where the original transaction fees are reimbursed to that that account.
Its understandable then, that Mr S would be frustrated by this inconsistency, and this service 
has approached PayPal about this matter and requested clarification and comments on 
several occasions, but PayPal have chosen not to provide these.
Its therefore a point of consideration as to whether Mr S is being unfairly treated by PayPal 
not reimbursing the original transaction fees on the account being complained about, or 
whether Mr S is benefitting from the non-application of PayPals updated terms and 
conditions on his other account.
PayPal have explained that they updated their terms and conditions some time ago such 
that the current terms state:
If you refund a Commercial Transaction payment, there are no fees to make the refund, but 
the fees you originally paid to receive the payment are not returned to you. 
PayPal also explained that they published notification of the changes to the terms on their 
website, as well as sent all account holders notification of the changes to the email address 
registered on accounts.
In response, Mr S has stated that the never received the email that PayPal sent because he 
no longer has access to the email address registered on his account. And Mr S also noted 
that because he had never received the notification of the proposed changes, he had never 
agreed to them, and so they couldnt fairly be applied to his account.
But it isnt the case that Mr S has to agree to changes to the terms and conditions, but 
instead it is the case that PayPal must notify customers of impending changes to those 
terms, and that PayPal retain the right to propose and implement such changes without the 
need for customer agreement.
Indeed, its common for a business to write their terms and conditions such that they allow 
the future modification of those terms and conditions, on the provision that customers are 
notified in advance of any changes being made.
An example of this is available presently on PayPals website, which confirms:
To use the PayPal services, you need to open a PayPal account. By opening and 
using a PayPal account, you agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions in 
this user agreement. You also agree to comply with the following additional 
documents and each of the other documents on the Legal Agreements page that 
apply to you
Fees page
Acceptable Use Policy 
Pay After Delivery terms 
Alternative Payment Methods Agreement 
All future changes notified in the Policy Update already published on the Legal 
Agreements page. 
Please read carefully all of the terms and conditions of this user agreement and each 
of the other documents that apply to you. We may revise this user agreement and 
any of the documents listed above from time to time. The revised version will be 
effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted. If our changes reduce your 
rights or increase your responsibilities, we will post a notice on the Policy Updates 
page of our website and provide notice to you of at least two months. 
By continuing to use our services after any changes to this user agreement take 
effect, you agree to be bound by those changes. If you do not agree with any 
changes, you may close your account before the changes take effect.  
The above confirms that PayPal maintain the right to amend their terms and conditions, and 
Im satisfied that its highly likely that a similar provision was in place at the time that Mr S 
opened his account.
Im also satisfied that Mr S was notified by PayPal of the impending changes to the terms 
and conditions that modified the way in which refunds were processed such that original transaction fees were no longer reimbursed, and this is because PayPal sent this notification 
to the email address registered on Mr Ss account.
Im aware that Mr S feels that PayPal could have sent this information to him via the 
messaging system on his account, which PayPal use frequently to send him other 
information. But PayPal have confirmed that their policy is to send these notifications to the 
registered email address on an account. This is a choice PayPal are entitled to make, and it 
must be noted that it isnt within the remit of this service to instruct a business to amend its 
internal policies.
Mr S has stated that he no longer has access to the email address registered on his account 
and so didnt receive the email that was sent. But this isnt something I feel it would be fair or 
reasonable to censure PayPal for, and it must be acknowledged that the responsibly for 
maintaining up to date contact information on the account rests with Mr S.
Mr S was also unhappy that PayPal didnt reimburse shipping costs that he applied for under 
the PayPal Return Shipping on Us scheme. But PayPal have been able to demonstrate that 
Mr S raised disputes under the reference numbers he has provided to an online market 
place closely linked to PayPal, but ultimately separate from PayPal, and they have no record 
of these claims been made to PayPal directly as Mr S has claimed.
All of which means that its difficult for me to conclude that PayPal have acted unfairly or 
unreasonably here, and while I can understand Mr Ss frustrations given the inconsistencies 
hes aware of as discussed previously, I feel that PayPals response to Mr Ss complaint, 
including the offer of £20 as a goodwill payment, represents a fair and reasonable outcome 
to this complaint. 
It follows that I wont be upholding this complaint or asking PayPal to take any further action 
at this time. I hope that Mr S can understand, given everything I have explained above, why I 
have made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 June 2021.
