The complaint
Mr H complains NewDay Ltd have unfairly sold his credit card debt to a third party.
What happened
In February and March 2019, Mr H told NewDay he was going through bankruptcy 
proceedings. Mr H said he was told by NewDay his debt wouldnt be sold to a third party.
Mr H said he later discovered NewDay sold his debt to a third party in April 2019. He said he 
received conflicting information from NewDay about whether the third party had bought the 
debt - or was just administering it. Mr H was also unhappy a default had been registered with 
the credit reference agencies regarding the credit card. He said hed made payments to 
NewDay in January and February 2019, which hadnt been accounted for. He complained to 
NewDay.
NewDay said the debt had been sold to a third party they use to administer accounts for 
customers who have filed for bankruptcy  and it wasnt for the purpose of collecting 
payment. NewDay said Mr H made them aware hed applied for bankruptcy, but they also 
told Mr H they would continue to follow their normal process until they had confirmation the 
bankruptcy order has been granted. 
NewDay said they didnt receive confirmation of the bankruptcy from Mr H until April 2019 
and by then theyd already arranged for Mr Hs account to be passed to the third party. 
NewDay couldnt locate any payments made by Mr H in January or February 2019, but 
asked Mr H to provide further details. They concluded they hadnt found any errors in how 
theyd handled Mr Hs account but offered him £40 compensation for any inconvenience or 
upset caused.
Mr H was unhappy with NewDays response, so he brought his complaint to our service.
Our investigator didnt Mr Hs complaint be upheld. She said she hadnt found anything, 
including in call recordings, that showed Mr H was told the debt wouldnt be sold on. She 
also pointed to Mr Hs credit agreement and she said NewDay acted fairly when they sold 
the debt to the third party.
Mr H didnt agree with our investigator. He said he was made bankrupt in March 2019 and 
NewDay sold his debt on in April 2019, so theyd acted unfairly. He said he was never told at 
any time on the phone they would sell the debt on and they shouldve given him more time 
for the bankruptcy documents to be sent over.
The complaint has now passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Mr H has said he is unhappy a default has been registered. NewDay has said they didnt 
register a default against Mr H.I can see from the credit file information Mr H has provided, 
the entry is showing as from the third party. It also appears to show on his file from June 
2019 onwards  which is after the third party acquired the account. 
So, If Mr H disagrees with the default, he will need to raise it with the third party and I wont 
comment on it further here.
Im not upholding Mr Hs complaint. Ill explain why.
NewDay have said Mr Hs account was transferred to a specialist agent they use in 
bankruptcy cases- so its a regular procedure for them to do this. Ive looked at a copy of the 
terms and conditions of Mr Hs credit agreement. Under section 19, Can we transfer our 
right and obligations under this agreement?, it says:
We may transfer our rights and our obligations under this Agreement to someone else, 
including information about you and how you have managed your account.
So I think NewDay applied the terms and conditions of the policy fairly when they transferred 
Mr Hs account to a third party.
Ive listened to the phone calls between Mr H and NewDay that took place in early 2019 and 
Ive not heard anything in these calls that persuades me Mr H was specifically told his 
account wouldnt be transferred to a third party. 
But when Mr H called in March 2019 he was told if any account is in arrears for more than 
180 days NewDay would transfer it to a third party, but the process was different when 
bankruptcy is involved. She didnt specify how it was different - so I can see why Mr H might 
have been under the impression the account would only be sold after it had been arrears for 
180 days. 
But the account was transferred to the third party because of the bankruptcy and not 
because of Mr Hs arrears. Mr H said NewDay acted unfairly as the bankruptcy was 
confirmed in March 2019 and NewDay didnt sell the debt until April 2019. But I can see from 
NewDays system notes Mr H didnt provide confirmation of the bankruptcy until after the 
account had been transferred and I can see Mr H had been made aware when he spoke to 
NewDay in March 2019 that they would continue processing his account as normal until they 
received confirmation the bankruptcy had been added to the insolvency register. So I dont 
think they acted unfairly here.
NewDay offered Mr H £40 compensation and taking into the circumstances, I wont be 
recommending any further award as I think this fairly represents the upset and 
inconvenience hes been caused.
Mr H said he made payments to NewDay in January 2019 and February 2019 that havent 
been accounted for. NewDay has said they cant locate these payments and has asked Mr H 
to provide information regarding the payments. I cant see he has provided this to us or
New Day  so Im unable to say he did make these payments.
Overall, I think NewDay have fairly applied their terms and conditions in transferring Mr Hs 
account to a third party and Ive not seen any evidence to suggest they told Mr H it wouldnt 
be.  I also think the compensation award of £40 is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 July 2020.
