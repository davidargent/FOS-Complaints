Mr D says Uncle Buck Finance LLP irresponsibly lent to him and didnt carry out proper 
affordability checks. 
background
Mr D took 13 loans  from Uncle Buck between July 2012 and November 2017. It seems that 
he had some difficulties  repaying his final loan and an outstanding balance  remains.

In our adjudicators latest assessment he didnt think that Uncle  Buck had treated Mr D 
unfairly when it approved  loans 1  7. This was because the information it gathered was 
proportionate and there was a significant gap in lending between  loans 3 and 4, which the 
adjudicator thought was enough  for Uncle Buck to start a new chain of lending.  
However, the adjudicator didnt think Uncle Buck shouldve provided any of the remaining 
loans because the adjudicator concluded  that by loan 8 a pattern of lending had been 
established which shouldve  indicated to Uncle Buck that Mr D wasnt able to sustainably 
repay this loan or any of the later loans.  
Uncle Buck  didnt accept  the adjudicators findings,  in response it made a number of points, 
including:
It has come concerns around removing negative information from the credit  reference 
agencies (in relation  to upheld loans)
there were some gaps  in lending, which showed that Mr D wasnt  dependent  on this 
type of lending
Uncle Buck uses a sophisticated creditworthiness assessment and it is entitled to rely 
on the information given to it by the credit  reference  agencies.
Ref: DRN20331722However, in order to bring this matter to a close Uncle Buck offered to refund interest and 
charges on loans 5, 9, 11 and a portion of what was paid towards loan 12. This offer was put 
to Mr D, but he didnt  accept it. 
Mr D also had some additional comments about the way he was using the loans  between  
March and September 2015. Mr D also told us that he had a guarantor  loan at the time. Mr D 
believes a fairer outcome  to his complaint is for loans 5  12 to be refunded.  
As no agreement could be reached  the case has been passed to me for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks in order to figure out 
whether Mr D could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
So Uncle Buck was required to establish  whether  Mr D could sustainably  repay  his loans  
not just whether the loan payments were  affordable  on a strict pounds  and pence 
calculation. The loan payments being affordable  on this basis might  be an indication Mr D 
could sustainably make  his repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the 
case. 
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, the consumers income  was low or 
the amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the 
Ref: DRN20331723risk of it becoming unsustainable  and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed 
expect a lender  to be able to show that it hasnt continued to provide these loans to a 
customer irresponsibly. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint.  From the review of the file, weve  also 
established that there was another £150  loan given to Mr D in August  2012  meaning in 
total he had 13 loans rather than 12. However,  even with this extra loan,  Im not departing 
from the outcome  our adjudicator  reached, and Im upholding the same number of loans. 
As our adjudicator explained, he thought proportionate checks  had been carried out before 
loans 1  7 were  provided. He also thought it was reasonable, given the gap in lending  of 
around 30 months between loans  3 and 4, that Uncle Buck  could consider this to be the start 
of a new lending  relationship with Mr D. And in my opinion,  the gap is enough for Uncle Buck  
to have treated  Mr Ds application afresh,  meaning  that loan 4 effectively became loan 1 in a 
new chain of lending.  
For the first 7 loans,  Uncle Buck says it agreed  to Mr Ds applications after he provided  
details of his monthly  income and expenditure. And, based on what he declared,  this 
information suggested that Mr D would be able to make the repayment he was committing  
to. So, in these  circumstances it wasnt irresponsible to provide the loan. 
I accept that Mr Ds actual circumstances may not have been reflected either in the 
information he himself  provided,  or the other information Uncle Buck  obtained via the credit  
checks. And Mr Ds full financial position might  well have been apparent if further information 
 such as bank  statements  - had been obtained. 
But Uncle Buck could only make its decision based  on the information it had available  at the 
time. And it was still in the early  stages of a lending  relationship for loans  1  7 when  looking 
at the gap and taking  into account how long the loans  were due to run. So I dont think  it had 
reached the stage  where there  was a greater risk of the loan repayments being 
unsustainable for Mr D. In these circumstances,  I dont think  Uncle  Buck needed  to take 
further steps to verify the information he had provided.
I can only uphold complaints about loans  where  I can safely say that a lender has done  
something wrong. And, in this case, I think that Uncle Buck  carried out reasonable checks  
for the first seven loans even though Mr Ds full financial position may not have been 
reflected in the information that Uncle Buck  gathered. 
So Im not upholding the complaint about loans 1  7, which means  Uncle Buck  isnt required 
to take any further  action  in relation to these loans. I appreciate  this will come as a 
disappointment to Mr D, but I want to reassure him that Ive thought about  the comments  he 
provided as to why some  earlier  loans should  be upheld, but in this instance I dont think  the 
pattern of lending in 2015 had reached  the point  that shouldve given Uncle Buck  caused  for 
concern. Equally, I also dont think that even  if Uncle Buck knew about  the guarantor  loan, 
that this wouldve led it to automatically  decline his applications for loans 1  7. 
However, Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern  of Uncle Bucks lending history  with Mr D. 
And having done so, I think that Uncle Buck should reasonably have seen that Mr D was 
unlikely to have  been able to make his loan repayments in a sustainable manner by the time 
it provided loan 8. I say this because:
Ref: DRN20331724There was an emerging pattern between loans 4 - 7 of Mr D taking new loans shortly 
after repaying previous ones. I think that by loan 8, Uncle Buck ought fairly and 
reasonably to have  regarded  that pattern as established. By the eighth loan Mr D had 
been indebted to Uncle Buck for just over ten months within  the last year.
 
Mr D wasnt  significantly reducing  the amounts he owed to Uncle Buck.  For example, 
loan 8 was taken out over 10 months after Mr Ds fourth loan was approved, and the 
value of this loan was for nearly three times the amount.  
I think that Mr D lost out because Uncle Buck provided loans 8  13 because:
the loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ds indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period of time;  
and
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ds ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im partly upholding Mr Ds complaint and Uncle  Buck  should  put things right as set out 
below.
Ive also carefully considered the additional points that Uncle Buck  has raised in response to 
our adjudicators findings. Our approach to this has been well defined,  and while I do 
appreciate there was a small gap between loans  11 and 12, there does appear to have  been  
a declined loan application between these loans.  So while I accept no funds were lent at this 
point, the fact that Mr D returned for further  funds is an indication that he was still reliant on 
short term loans to fill a hole in his finances. So in this instance,  I dont think  the break  
between loans 11 and 12 is sufficient for Uncle Buck to have looked at loan 12 as the 
beginning of a new chain of lending. 
putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
Based on what Uncle  Buck has told us there  is an outstanding balance due on loan 13, and 
Ive thought about this when deciding what to ask Uncle Buck  to do to put things right. 
refund  all interest and charges Mr D paid on loans 8 to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
Ref: DRN20331725rework loan 13 applying all payments made  by Mr D as if they went towards  the 
principal amount borrowed. But importantly,  Uncle Buck needs to make  sure that it 
collects no more than the principal sum lent. 
If and when the amount Mr D has paid exceeds the amount he was lent, any further 
amounts paid should be treated as overpayments. Any overpayments  that may have 
been made should be refunded to Mr D with 8% simple interest from the date the 
overpayment was made to the date of settlement ;
In the event that what Mr D has already paid towards loan 13 is less than what he 
was lent, Uncle Buck can deduct this amount from the compensation that it needs to 
pay Mr D for loans  8 and 12.
remove all entries about  loans 8 - 13 from Mr Ds credit file. The period of time Mr D 
owed Uncle Buck money means  that any information still recorded about these loans 
is adverse. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I partly uphold  Mr Ds complaint.  
Uncle Buck  Finance LLP should put things right for Mr D as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 November  2019.
