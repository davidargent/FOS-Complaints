DRN-3880419
The complaint
Miss K complains about Aviva Insurance Limiteds handling of her Buildings Insurance claim.
All references to Aviva also include its appointed agents.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Aviva concluded the damage was minor and wasnt subsidence related. Its report 
says the property has suffered from thermal movement and also references moisture 
movement from hot summer months. Photos of the property and the cracking have 
been provided. But theres no reference or detail of what inspections or testing Aviva 
carried out at the property. 
Miss K said a possible cause of the damage is standing water under her property. As 
this has been brought to Avivas attention, Id expect it to address this in its 
investigation and Ive not seen sufficient evidence it has done so.
Overall, Im not persuaded Aviva has conducted sufficient investigations to 
reasonably decline the claim.
So for these reasons, I uphold this complaint.
Putting things right
Aviva should re-examine the subsidence claim under the terms and conditions of the policy 
and carry out further investigations to establish the cause of damage at the property.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Ks complaint.
To put things right, I direct Aviva Insurance Limited to do as Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 28 February 2023.
