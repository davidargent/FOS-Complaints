K820x#14complaint
Mr K complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA unfairly reversed a payment on his account.
background
Mr K sold goods, via a third party online  marketing organisation, to a buyer who lived 
abroad. The buyer claimed the goods  were defective. Initially  the third party  organisation 
decided the dispute in Mr Ks favour.  But the buyer  then made a chargeback claim through  
his credit card supplier which found  in favour  of the buyer on the basis  the goods were  not 
as described. So PayPal removed the payment made into Mr Ks account and returned it to 
the buyer.
PayPal said it was bound by the regulations set by the credit  card supplier and didnt control  
the outcome of a chargeback dispute.  And its Seller Protection doesnt apply to chargebacks 
where goods are significantly not as described.
Our investigator didnt  think PayPal  had done anything wrong. He noted  that PayPals user 
agreement makes it clear that sellers  can become liable  to PayPal for the full amount of a 
transaction in the case of reversals or chargebacks. Although our investigator could see how 
frustrating this was for Mr K he explained that it wasnt unreasonable of PayPal to have 
followed its terms and conditions.
Mr K was disappointed with his opinion. He believed the buyer hadnt acted in good  faith and 
thought PayPal shouldve challenged this. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
conclusion as our investigator  for very similar reasons. 
I can see how frustrating this must be for Mr K particularly as he tried to resolve this with the 
buyer. But as our investigator explained, I cant comment on the merits of this dispute.
I know my decision will be a disappointment to Mr K but as our investigator explained PayPal 
is ultimately bound by the regulations of the credit card supplier  and cant control the 
outcome of a chargeback dispute.  That is a matter between the card issuer  and the 
cardholder. And because the buyer/cardholder  claimed a chargeback on the basis  that the 
goods were not as described, Mr K isnt covered by PayPals Seller Protection. That 
restriction is set out in its terms and conditions.
Mr K doesnt  think the credit card company has investigated this matter fully. But I cant  
comment on this as Mr Ks complaint is against PayPal. And he doesnt think PayPal has 
challenged the dispute in a proper manner. I can understand why Mr K feels so aggrieved 
about what has happened but we cant comment on the policies and processes PayPal has 
in place to dispute chargebacks. Unfortunately for Mr K, PayPal is bound by the decision  of 
the credit  card company.
I can see that PayPal  has followed its terms and conditions relating  to chargebacks and so I 
cant fairly find its done anything wrong.
