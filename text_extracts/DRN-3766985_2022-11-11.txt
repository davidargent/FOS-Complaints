The complaint
Mr E complains ClearBank Limited didnt explain or provide enough information in an email 
offer he received to set his business up as a limited company and open an account for that 
company. He also says he couldnt contact them by phone despite paying for a subscription.
What happened
Mr E holds an account as a sole trader with a firm for which ClearBank are responsible. For 
ease of reference I will refer to that firm as ClearBank from now on. 
In 2021 Mr E received an email from ClearBank which informed him that they could help him 
set up as a limited company and consider an application for an account for that company. He 
took them up on their offer.
Clear bank set up the limited company with Mr E as its director and opened an account in its 
name but then closed the account before it was used.
Mr E complained about the account being closed and ClearBanks refusal to tell him why. He 
later refused their offer to reconsider whether they could provide an account to the limited 
company subject to further checks. 
Mr E says he doesnt want to operate his business as a limited company, and he continues 
to run it the same way he did before the company was set up. He says he took up 
ClearBanks offer because it was free, but he wasnt given the information he needed about 
the implications of operating as a limited company.
I issued a separate final decision addressing the closure of the limited companys account 
and ClearBank not removing the company from Companies House. I did not consider the 
nature of the email ClearBank sent to Mr E which advertised their offer in that decision. This 
is because the email was sent to Mr E as a result of him holding an account in his name for 
his sole trader business. The limited company had yet to be set up at that point.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Es complaint. They concluded:
The information on ClearBanks website which was linked to in the email Mr E 
received gave enough information about what creating a limited company meant. It 
was for Mr E to clarify what further information he wanted to know in terms of what 
incorporation meant for his business.
The frequently asked questions section of the website specifically said that a limited 
company would be registered at Companies House. Also, every limited company 
would need to be registered at Companies House.
Mr E had a premium package for his sole trader account, which meant he could 
contact ClearBank by phone. But he didnt pay for the service at the time he brought 
his complaint to our service, as it was still under a free trial period at that time. So, no 
fee was applied by ClearBank which should be refunded.
Mr E is unhappy with the outcome the investigator reached and asked for a final decision by 
an ombudsman. As a result, his complaint has been given to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Es complaint. Ill explain why.
ClearBank sent Mr E an email which said they could help him incorporate his business. 
Reading through the email, it mentions the potential benefits of incorporation and how 
ClearBank could help set the company up. But I dont find the email ought to have been 
interpreted as a personal recommendation that incorporating his business was the right thing 
to do for him.
Instead, the email referred to it being Mr Es choice on whether to incorporate. It stated:
Read more on whether registering your company is the right choice for you here.
The word here linked to a webpage entitled Limited company or sole trader? What to 
consider before you choose. That webpage set out the various benefits and disadvantages 
of incorporation, and what customers needed to think about. The information clearly stated 
the extra responsibilities and requirements running a limited company entailed, and it made 
clear that setting up a limited company meant it would be registered at Companies House.
I dont find that by offering an additional service ClearBank were obligated to provide 
personal advice to every customer who wanted to set up as a limited company and open an 
account for that company. Instead the nature of their marketing indicated the choice to 
incorporate lay firmly with each business customer.
ClearBanks email also stated:
Your application will be treated as a new . . . application and is subject to approval and 
identity checks. You must use an email address different from the one associated with your 
current . . . account.
So, ClearBank were clear that an account was not guaranteed for the limited company. This 
is understandable given firms like ClearBank have legal and regulatory obligations to meet 
when deciding whether to offer and run accounts, even for existing customers. 
On balance, I dont find that ClearBank provided unclear or misleading information to Mr E. 
Mr E was responsible for the decision he took to incorporate his business and to take 
ClearBank up on its offer. I dont find ClearBank should be held responsible for a decision he 
now regrets making or because they decided not to continue with an account for his limited 
company.
ClearBank explained that Mr E had a package for his sole trader account which allowed him 
to make phone calls. He asked for the fee he paid to be refunded because he couldnt 
contact ClearBank by phone. But ClearBank says he wasnt charged a fee as the phone 
service was still under a free trial period at the time in question. I have no information to 
show this wasnt the case, so I am not directing ClearBank to refund a fee to him.
My final decision
I have decided not to uphold Mr Es complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 December 2022.
