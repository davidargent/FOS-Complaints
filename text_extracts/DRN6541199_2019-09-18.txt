K821x#15complaint
Miss S complains  that MYJAR Limited  lent her money that she couldnt  afford  to repay.    
Miss S wants MYJAR to refund the interest  that she paid on some  of the loans. And Miss S 
wants MYJAR to remove any negative information about the loans from her credit file.
background
Miss S out nine instalment loans with MYJAR between  January 2016 and January 2019. The 
loan amounts varied from £200 to £1,850 and were  repayable by monthly instalments. A 
summary of Miss Ss lending is set out below:

9 04/01/2019 unpaid 12 £1,850 £282
Before this service became involved, MYJAR agreed to refund the interest  and charges that 
Miss S had paid on loan six. MYJAR  said that it would  deduct the refund  from Miss Ss 
outstanding loan balance.
The adjudicator recommended that Miss Ss complaint should be upheld  in part. He 
recommended that MYJAR refund the interest and charges that Miss S had paid on loans 
four to nine. The adjudicator also recommended that MYJAR remove  the affected  loans 
entirely from Miss Ss credit file. 
MYJAR disagrees with the adjudicators recommendation. It considers the checks  it carried  
out were proportionate.  And MYJAR doesnt  think that weve  considered all of the 
information that it provided about  the checks it carried out.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. 
Ref: DRN65411992With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that 
MYJAR should fairly and reasonably have done  more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that its important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Miss S could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Source Book defines sustainable as 
being without  undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, as well as without  having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
So it follows  that a lender  should realise, or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ss complaint.
loans one to three
Miss S didnt disagree with the adjudicators  opinion about loans  one to three.  Because  of 
this, I dont think there is any ongoing dispute about  these loans. So I wont be making  a 
decision about this lending. But as the loans were part of the borrowing relationship  that 
Miss S had with MYJAR, I will take them in to account when considering her other loans.
loans four to nine
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans four to nine 
because I dont think that its necessary for me to do so. Instead, Ive looked at the overall 
pattern of MYJARs lending history with Miss S to see if there  was a point at which MYJAR 
shouldve reasonably seen Miss S was persistently reliant on short  term loans. So that 
further lending  was unsustainable or otherwise harmful.  
Ref: DRN65411993Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ss case, I think this point was reached  by loan 
four. I say this because:
loan four was the fourth  loan that Miss S had taken out in seven months.  Miss S 
applied for the loan within two weeks of repaying loan three. And loan four was for 
double the amount  of her first two loans. 
Miss S went on to take out loan five on the same  day that she repaid  loan four. And 
Miss S did the same thing when she took out loan six.  So MYJAR shouldve realised 
that it was more likely than not Miss S had to borrow further to cover the hole left by 
the repayment of her previous loans.
Miss S wasnt making any real inroads in to the amount that she owed to MYJAR and 
ended up making repayments in almost  every month over a three year period. Loan  
nine in January  2019 was for a larger amount than any previous loan. Miss S had 
paid large amount  of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to MYJAR over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Miss S lost out because  MYJAR provided loans four to nine because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ss indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the extended period of time she owed MYJAR  money was likely to have had negative  
implications on Miss Ss ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
Overall, I consider its fair to uphold Miss Ss complaint  about  loans four to nine on the basis  
that MYJAR  shouldve seen these loans were unsustainable. 
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges that Miss S paid on loans four to nine;
 
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum  to each  of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;  
write off any unpaid interest and charges on loan nine;
if it chooses to, apply the refund  against  the outstanding  principal balance  on loan nine**; 
and
the number  of loans taken by the time of loan four means that any information about 
loans four to nine is negative. So all entries about loans four to nine should be removed 
from Miss Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Miss S a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. If MYJAR 
intends to apply the refund against  the outstanding principal balance  on loan nine, it must do 
so after deducing  the tax.
Ref: DRN65411994**If after taking these  steps theres still an outstanding balance, I remind MYJAR of its duty 
to treat Miss S reasonably and sympathetically,  particularly  if she puts forward  any 
repayment proposals.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss Ss complaint in part and direct  MYJAR Limited to put 
things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 October  2019.
