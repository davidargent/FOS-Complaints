The complaint
Mr B complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) irresponsibly approved two 
loans despite being aware he had mental health issues.
What happened
Under a lasting power of attorney (LPOA), Mr B has been represented by a close relative 
when bringing this complaint. To keep things simple, any reference I make to Mr B will 
include his representative unless specified.
Mr B has a mental health problem that can affect his behaviour and in turn, his ability to 
manage his finances. In early 2019 his representative had a meeting with NatWest branch 
staff about his condition and discussed that a LPOA had been registered. 
In June and July of 2019 Mr B successfully applied online for two separate loans totalling 
£25,000. Mr B has said NatWest shouldnt have approved either of these loans, and it 
ignored the LPOA and previous conversations had about his condition. 
NatWest said the loans were taken out online so there was no staff interaction during the 
application. And it said a LPOA on the account wouldnt stop Mr Bs ability to apply for credit. 
It also said Mr B has held a steady job and has lived independently from his parents which 
indicate his capabilities. At the time of this decision, one loan has been repaid by Mr B, but 
the other is with NatWests collections and recoveries department. 
Our investigator considered the complaint and upheld it, saying NatWest hadnt carried out 
sufficient checks during the loan applications. He said NatWest was aware there was a 
LPOA registered on Mr Bs account, and that hed previously asked the bank to intervene on 
the account to prevent debt from accruing. The investigator recommended that NatWest 
freeze interest on the money lent, remove the entries from his credit file and compensate 
£200 for the distress caused. As Mr B had used the money, our investigator didnt feel it was 
fair for NatWest to write off the remaining debt.
NatWest agreed with our investigators recommendations, however Mr B felt the 
compensation offered was too low. He explained hed suffered a long manic episode as a 
result of NatWests actions, and it should be given harsher sanctions or to act as a deterrent 
against similar lending. Mr B also explained how his condition has impacted his ability to 
work and his living situation in recent years. As agreement wasnt met, the complaint has 
been passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same conclusions as our investigator, and for broadly the 
same reasons. Our investigator has already explained in detail why he felt NatWest hadnt 
carried out sufficient checks when Mr B applied for his loans. NatWest has agreed to his 
assessment, and in the most part, so has Mr B. So I see no reason to go over these same 
points again.
The dispute that remains in this case is about what NatWest needs to do to put things right. 
Mr B has said the £200 awarded in compensation isnt enough, and that the impact of the 
lending allowed him to accrue further debt elsewhere as well as contributing towards a very 
difficult time in his life.
When considering whats happened within a complaint, my role is to consider whether it's 
fair to award compensation. This isn't intended to fine or sanction a business  this would fall 
to the regulator (FCA). 
So Ive thought about the consequences of NatWests mistake. As our investigator has said, 
Mr B used the funds towards his savings and existing debts. So its difficult to find that he 
suffered direct financial losses as a result of this. And by NatWest now agreeing to clear the 
interest and charges from these loans, Im satisfied this puts Mr B back into as close a 
position as he can be had it not lent to him. 
Mr B said the loans encouraged further irresponsible spending at a time when he was 
unwell. While Ive thought carefully about this, Im not persuaded it would be fair to attribute 
this lending with other businesses to NatWests actions, or hold it responsible for this. I say 
this as I think this was outside of NatWests control, and Mr B is ultimately still able to 
complain to other individual lenders should he feel they have acted irresponsibly.
Mr B has given us a lot of detail about his mental health and the challenges hes faced while 
going through this particularly difficult time. Im very sympathetic to his situation. And while I 
can see NatWests actions may have had an impact on these challenges, I dont think it 
would be fair to hold NatWest responsible for everything thats happened or try to financially 
compensate him for distress that isnt related to the mistake NatWest has made.  On this 
basis, Im directing NatWest to pay Mr B £200 in compensation.
In summary, NatWest made a mistake by lending to Mr B given what he knew of his 
circumstances. But Im satisfied the steps our investigator has outlined and NatWest has 
agreed to is a fair and reasonable solution in the circumstances. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct National Westminster Plc to do the following:
freeze interest and charges on the active loan until its settled and refund any interest 
and charges that have already been paid for both loans;
remove both entries from Mr Bs credit file, including any unpaid notifications on the 
loan;
arrange a suitable way forward for any remaining monies owed with Mr B and his 
representatives; and
award Mr B £200 in compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B and Mr B to 
accept or reject my decision before 8 December 2020.
