The complaint
Mr S says Morses Club PLC lent to him irresponsibly. He says that repaying the loans

One of our adjudicators looked into the complaint and said they thought it should be upheld 
from the point of loan 5 onwards. Morses Club doesnt agree, so the complaint has come to 
me for an ombudsmans final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this 
approach when thinking about Mr Ss complaint.
Morses Club needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr 
S could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. However, certain factors might point to the fact that 
Morses Club should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Morses Club was required to establish 
whether Mr S could sustainably repay his loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr S could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Morses Club told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to 
lend to Mr S. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked at the overall pattern of lending 
history to him with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Morses Club should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive 
considered whether, at some point, Morses Club should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. 
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loans 1, 2, 3 and 4 ought not to 
be upheld as they appeared affordable. Ive looked carefully at these and taken note of Mr 
Ss job and of the income declared by him at around the time. Ive also looked at what he 
said about his monthly expenditure. With this information, and bearing in mind what Ive said 
above about the length of the lending relationship, I think the checks which Morses Club 
most likely carried out appear to have been proportionate for loans 1  4. And I think these 
levels of checks, together with the income and expenditure details provided by Mr S, would 
have made those particular loans appear affordable for him. 
However, I think the emerging and repeated lending pattern from the point of loan 5 onwards 
in this case would have looked different and therefore required a more thorough and 
responsible approach. The overall pattern of Morses Clubs lending to Mr S should have 
caused it to see, in my view, that it shouldnt have provided any further loans from this point 
onwards. 
This is because this was his fifth short-term loan application with Morses Club in the 
previous 18 months. And in common with his borrowing pattern thus far, he was again 
asking to borrow relatively quickly after paying off a previous loan and the amount he was 
asking to borrow had reached the highest level yet. So Morses Club ought to have realised that Mr S was probably borrowing to meet regular shortfalls in his income and to meet an 
ongoing need. He was having to consistently take out high interest, short-term lending and 
his indebtedness was becoming unsustainable. Morses Club should have seen this and 
ought to have realised Mr S was at risk of not managing to repay his loans sustainably. 
So Im upholding this complaint in respect of loans 5 - 11. Morses Club repeatedly lent in an 
unsustainable manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing Mr S to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market 
for these high-cost loans.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans 5 - 11;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 5 -11 should be completely 
removed from Mr Ss credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses Club to take off tax from this interest. Morses Club must give Mr S a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given, I partly uphold Mr Ss complaint. Morses Club PLC should put things 
right for Mr S as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 September 2020.
