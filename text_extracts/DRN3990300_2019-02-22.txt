K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs Hs endowment policy  with Phoenix Life Limited was made paid-up in 1999 
because premiums went unpaid. Mr and Mrs H say they didnt cancel the direct  debit, and 
didnt receive any notification about this.
background
The policy started  on 25 June 1993 and had a target  amount of £31,825. The premiums 
were £67.69 a month and the policy had a 25 year term. 
Phoenix says that in October 1998  Mr and Mrs Hs bank recalled the direct  debit,  and then in 
November 1998  it was notified by the bank that the direct debit  instruction  had been  
cancelled. Mr and Mrs H say they didnt cancel the direct  debit.  Phoenix  has provided copies 
of letters  it says were sent to Mr and Mrs H in November 1998 and January 1999,  however 
Mr and Mrs H say they didnt receive them.
In October  2016 Phoenix wrote to Mr and Mrs H about their policy  which led to Mr H phoning  
Phoenix. Unfortunately he was given wrong  information in that call about when and why the 
policy had been  made paid-up.
Mr and Mrs H complained  to Phoenix. It rejected their complaint about the policy being 
paid- up and offered £200 for the wrong information  that was given in the October 2016 call.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr and Mrs H didnt agree and so its been  
passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
I trust Mr and Mrs H wont take it as a discourtesy that Ive condensed  their complaint in the 
way that I have. Ours is an informal dispute  resolution service, and Ive concentrated on 
what I consider to be the crux of the complaint. Although Ive read and considered the whole 
file Ill keep my comments to what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on any specific  point 
its not because  Ive not considered it but because I dont think I need  to comment on it in 
order to reach the right outcome.  
This service is impartial between, and independent  from,  consumers and businesses. What  
this means is that we dont represent  either party, and I dont act under eithers  instructions  
or take directions on how a complaint will be looked at or what  questions  should be asked or 
answered.
Mr and Mrs H have said they didnt  cancel the direct  debit and suggested Phoenix might 
have just stopped collecting the premiums. Phoenix hasnt said Mr and Mrs H cancelled the 
direct debit - just it was cancelled at that end, ie Mr and Mrs Hs banks end - this is shown 
by it being listed  as instruction cancelled.  We can tell from that Phoenix wasnt involved in 
the cancellation of the direct debit, or the non-payment of the premiums. How and why the 
mandate was cancelled  - therefore  - isnt relevant here as I can only look at the actions of 
Phoenix and it is clear Phoenix  wasnt involved.
Ref: DRN39903002Ultimately it was Mr and Mrs Hs responsibility to make sure the premiums were  paid.  By 
sending two letters - in November 1998  and January 1999 - I consider Phoenix made 
reasonable efforts to contact them. Phoenix  had no responsibility to write to Mr and Mrs H 
using recorded  delivery, or to try to contact them by phone. As I said,  it was Mr and Mrs Hs 
responsibility to make  sure the premiums were  paid, not Phoenixs  responsibility to chase 
Mr and Mrs H up for them.
Mr and Mrs H have admitted they received the annual policy statements that were  sent to 
them by Phoenix. Mr H said:
The annual statement  letters say Bonus payments and I mistakenly  presumed  that the 
policy was exceeding  their projected  returns  and that this amount was payable  after the 
mortgage had been paid off. Silly me.
Phoenix has provided copies of nine annual statements (from  2010  to 2018). The statement 
from May 2010 says:
Policy  value £1,508.74  
The amount you will receive from your policy may be lower or higher than quoted 
because the funds  that your policy is linked to are subject to falls and rises in 
investment markets.
If you would like a projected maturity value  of your policy  (an illustration of what  you 
may get back at your end date), please contact us
The value of your policy is calculated by multiplying the number of units by the current  
unit price.
oNumber of units 930.75
oPrice of each unit 162.1p
oValue £1,508.74
Also if your policy has with-profits units, then the value of with-profits units  is before 
any final bonus or market value  reduction that may apply
The wording  on the annual statements is consistent  through to the 2018 statement with just 
the figures changing. The figures are as follows:
Date of statement Number of units Price of each unit Value
May 2010 930.75 162.1p £1,508.74
May 2011 907.04 162.1p £1,470.31
May 2012 882.42 162.1p £1,430.40
May 2013 856.87 162.1p £1,388.98
May 2014 830.31 162.1p £1,345.93
May 2015 803.17 162.7p £1,306.75
May 2016 775.55 166.0p £1,287.41
May 2017 747.70 169.0p £1,263.61
May 2018 720.08 170.6p £1,228.45
Ive considered what Mr and Mrs H have said about  what they thought  the annual 
statements were telling  them, and Ive also considered the wording on the annual 
Ref: DRN39903003statements. Having done so Im satisfied these  werent misleading. Theres  nothing in the 
statements that would imply  the figures quoted (of between £1,228 and £1,508) are an 
amount due in excess of the original target amount. The wording used is policy value so 
that seems fairly clear that the figure  quoted is the entire policy  value.
I can only hold Phoenix liable for things it has done wrong. Here Im satisfied Phoenix:
attempted to collect the policy premiums up until the direct debit was cancelled,
wasnt involved in the cancellation  of the direct debt,
wrote  twice to Mr and Mrs H about  the policy at the time the premiums stopped,
had no regulatory  responsibility to send  letters to Mr and Mrs H by recorded delivery, 
or to try to reach them by phone,  and
sent annual  statements  to Mr and Mrs H which were  clear and not misleading about 
the value of the policy.
Having considered all that, and bearing  in mind  it was Mr and Mrs Hs responsibility to 
ensure their premiums were paid, Im satisfied  Phoenix did nothing  wrong when  it made the 
policy paid-up in 1999. There was some  confusion in Phoenixs  recent  letters about when 
the premiums stopped,  but Im satisfied that doesnt alter the overall outcome of this 
complaint.
Ive also considered Mr Hs recollections  of the phone call he had with Phoenix in October 
2016. In his submissions  to us Mr H says I was told the policy was made paid up. I then 
asked if that meant the mortgage  would  be paid in full and was told Yes.  Ive listened to the 
phone call in question, and whilst Mr H was given wrong information about  why the policy  
was paid-up at no point did he ask if that meant the mortgage would be paid in full, nor was 
he told it would be. 
In that call there was also a discussion  between Mr H and the call handler about  the fact 
Mr H would be sent a change of address letter and he was told to just ignore it; the call 
handler explained that Mr Hs postcode needed updating which  would automatically 
generate the letter.  The same automatic letter generation  would have happened in 2018 for 
Mrs Hs personal  record.  This answers  Mr and Mrs Hs point Also  there  were  two strange 
letters received  regarding change of address. One was addressed to me [Mr H] and dated 
24th October  2016 and the other addressed  to my wife [Mrs H] dated 5th June 2018. Both 
letters say that Phoenix Life Ltd Records have  been amended to show  your change of 
address. As we have lived at the same address for 25 years  we found these rather  strange.
The incorrect information Mr H was given  in the phone call in October 2016 is whats  called a 
misrepresentation. When were looking at complaints about  misrepresentations we consider 
the appropriate remedy is to place the consumer in the position they would be in if the 
incorrect information hadnt been  given.  We dont put them  in the position  they would be in if 
it had been correct. 
Mr H was given the wrong  information  about when and why the policy  had been made 
paid- up; that was the misrepresentation.  Had that not happened  he would have understood 
the correct information from the call; that is the policy  had been  made  paid-up  in 1999 due to 
non-payment of the premiums.  Phoenix  has confirmed that the maturity  value of the policy  in 
June 2018 was much higher than the amount Mr and Mrs H would have received in 
October 2016 had they chosen to surrender  the policy at that point.
Ref: DRN39903004Mr and Mrs H could never have received more than the value of the policy  taking into 
account that it had been  made paid-up in 1999,  so it wouldnt be fair to tell Phoenix it has to 
pay them  more now. It wouldnt be the correct remedy for this misrepresentation. The correct  
remedy was that which  was given by Phoenix,  a small amount of compensation in 
recognition of the confusion caused.  As it already offered this at the time I dont think its fair 
to tell Phoenix to do anything else.  
Were not the regulator; weve no power  to fine or punish businesses, and our awards  arent 
punitive. Clearly no amount  of compensation can change what  Mr H was told in 
October 2016. Phoenix has apologised for the mistake and offered £200 compensation and 
having considered everything Im satisfied thats  a fair outcome. 
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  I leave it to Mr and Mrs H to decide  if now  on reflection  they 
want to accept the £200 offer made by Phoenix  (if theyve not already done so). My final 
decision concludes this services consideration of the complaint, which means well not be 
engaging in any further consideration or discussion of the merits of it.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision  before  22 March  2019.
