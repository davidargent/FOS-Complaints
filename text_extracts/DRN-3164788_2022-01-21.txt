The complaint
Mr P complains that a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement with 
Santander Consumer (UK) plc, trading as Kia Finance, wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
A new car was supplied to Mr P under a conditional sale agreement with Kia Finance that he 
electronically signed in March 2021. He collected the car in April 2021 and six days later it 
broke down on a motorway because of a loss of its electronics. He called out roadside 
assistance and the car was recovered to a local manufacturers dealer. 
The car was inspected by the local dealer and the supplying dealer but no fault was found. 
Mr P was offered a refund of two monthly payments but he said that he wanted to reject the 
car and he complained to Kia Finance. It said that the two dealers had been unable to 
replicate the fault so his request to reject the car wasnt accepted. Mr P wasnt satisfied with 
its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that 
the evidence that Mr P had provided was enough to prove the fault or that it would be fair 
and reasonable to ask Kia Finance to accept rejection of the car. He said that Mr P had 
already received a refund of two months payments as a gesture of goodwill.
Mr P has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says, in summary, 
that:
the supplying dealer and local dealer only carried out road tests which wasnt 
sufficient to diagnose the reported defect and satisfy a reasonableness test that the 
car was fit for purpose;
hes provided detailed evidence of the catastrophic failure that was reasonable and 
substantial - the fault was reported immediately to the dealer, the roadside 
assistance service attended and reported electrical faults and he doesnt accept that 
he has to produce further evidence that the car wasnt fit for purpose;
a serious catastrophic failure of this kind shouldnt happen with any car let alone one 
only 6 days old and he has the rights under the Consumer Rights Act to reject the car 
if something goes wrong within the first 30 days;
his rights under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional 
Charges) Regulations 2013 havent been taken into account;
the duty of care hasnt been complied with;
the goodwill offered was a paltry Â£220 and leaves him in a far worse position as hes 
lost confidence in the safety and reliability of the car and hes not received it; and
theres no recognition that compensation is justified due to the emotional distress and 
suffering caused by the life-threatening experience.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Kia Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr P - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr P was a new car and I consider that it was 
reasonable for him to expect that it would be free from even minor defects;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
Mr P has described the loss of electronics that he experienced only six days after 
hed collected the car  that must have been a very distressing and upsetting 
experience for him and I sympathise with him for that;
the report from the breakdown assistance service says loss of electrics, tow to main 
dealer and doesnt provide any further information about a fault with the car; 
Mr P has provided screenshots showing a battery warning and has provided a link to 
an online discussion forum about battery issues with this model of car but, other than 
the breakdown assistance report, hes provided no independent evidence to show 
that theres a fault with the car that was supplied to him;
the car has been inspected by the local dealer and the supplying dealer, which 
included test drives and the job cards show that no diagnostic trouble codes were 
found, the battery was tested and the wiring in the engine bay and under the 
dashboard was inspected but no fault was found;
I understand that Mr P has been able to continue to use the car, no fault with the car 
has been found by either the local dealer or the supplying dealer and Ive seen no 
other evidence to show that hes continued to have issues with the car;
the Consumer Rights Act 2015 gives a consumer a right to reject faulty goods within 
the first thirty days  but to be able to exercise that right there must be a fault with the 
goods and Im not persuaded that Mr P has provided enough evidence to show that 
theres a fault with the car or that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was 
supplied to him;
Mr P says that the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional 
Charges) Regulations 2013 apply to the agreement under which the car was supplied 
to him so he had the right to return the car within fourteen days  but conditional sale 
agreements are exempt from those regulations because they must include 
withdrawal rights under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and I dont consider that Mr P 
had a right to cancel the agreement;
the terms and conditions of the agreement set out Mr Ps right to withdraw from the 
agreement within the first fourteen days  but that would only apply to the finance 
provided under the agreement and Mr P would need to pay for the car by other 
means  and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr P gave the required notice to Kia 
Finance to exercise his right to withdraw from the agreement;Mr P was offered a refund of two months payments under the agreement through the 
supplying dealer  he says that hes not received it and if he now wants to accept 
that offer I suggest that he contacts the supplying dealer;
Mr P has clearly lost confidence in the car and I sympathise with him for that and the 
other issues that hes experienced, but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence in these circumstances to show that theres a fault with the car or that the 
car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to him; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Kia Finance to allow Mr P 
to reject the car and end the conditional sale agreement, to refund to him any of the 
payments that hes made under the agreement, to pay him any other compensation 
or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 February 2022.
