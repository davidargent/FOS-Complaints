The complaint
Mr T has complained about loans granted to him by Elevate Credit International Limited 
trading as Sunny (Sunny or the lender). Mr T says he was struggling with existing debts 
when he took out loans from Sunny. He says that the loans were unaffordable and Sunny 
would have known that had it looked into his finances in more detail.
What happened
Sunny agreed 22 loans for Mr T from January 2015 to January 2017. The loans were all 
instalment loans to be repaid over six months and ranged in value from £150 to £500. The 
below table sets out some information Sunny has provided about these loans (with numbers 
rounded to the nearest pound). As the table shows many of the loans ran concurrently.

Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ts complaint in part and recommended that Sunny refund all of 
the interest and charges he paid on loans 6 to 22. 
Sunny disagreed with this recommendation but offered to refund the interest and charges
Mr T paid from loan 14 onwards. It said  it would have been prudent to have done things 
differently after we granted his 14th loan. Mr [T] had been borrowing with us for just over a 
year with no breaks in lending, his loan amounts had increased since the beginning of the 
lending relationship and it was the highest he had borrowed. I believe Mr [T]s financial 
circumstances had not improved over time and therefore he was not using short term 
lending for its intended purpose but rather for other means.
Mr T declined this offer and the complaint has now come to me, as an ombudsman, to 
review and resolve.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending  including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Ive followed that 
approach here. 
The Financial Conduct Authority was the regulator when Mr T took out his loans. The 
relevant rules and guidance set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook said that for all loans 
Sunny needed to check that Mr T could afford to meet his repayments in a sustainable 
manner. This meant Mr T being able to meet his repayments out of his normal income 
without having to go without or borrow further. 
The regulations werent prescriptive about what checks Sunny needed to carry out in order 
to reasonably assess whether or not Mr T would be able to meet his repayments 
sustainably. But the regulations said that such checks needed to be proportionate. This 
suggests that the same checks might not be the appropriate thing to do for all consumers, or 
for the same consumer in all circumstances.
In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed checks
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. Sunny says it asked Mr T for information about his income and expenses each time he 
applied for a loan. The lender recorded Mr Ts monthly income as around £2,060 (average) 
for his first three loans and then as £2,450 from loan 4 onwards. It recorded his monthly 
expenses as approximately £600 to £1,300 and estimated that he never had less than £860 
left over each month to meet his loan repayments. 
Sunny also said that it used information from third party credit reference agencies to ensure 
the loans were affordable for Mr T and to check his credit history. It hasnt provided the 
results of these checks but it has provided a summary which states there were no 
bankruptcies or debt management plans recorded on his credit file. It doesnt show the 
amount of any existing debt Mr T had or how much he might have been paying towards this.
Mr Ts first loan was for £350, and he repaid this within two weeks. He took out a second 
loan of £150 a few weeks later, and when he repaid that he borrowed again a few weeks 
later. He took out his fourth loan while his third was still running, bringing the total amount 
borrowed at that point to £600. 
It seems from the information Mr T gave Sunny that he would have enough disposable 
income to sustainably meet his loan repayments each month for these loans. And, from the 
information I have, he didnt have any problems with his repayments that Sunny ought to 
have taken into account when agreeing further credit. 
In some cases I might think that a lender ought to have taken further steps to understand the 
full extent of a borrowers financial situation before agreeing to lend, irrespective of the 
information theyve provided. But, given the amount Mr T was borrowing relative to his 
income and that this was early in their lending relationship, I dont think it was unreasonable 
of Sunny to decide to lend on the basis of the information it had.  Altogether, I cant say that 
Ive seen enough strong indications to suggest that Sunny should have gone further in its 
checks for these loans or declined to lend to him.
However, I do think Sunny ought to have carried out more comprehensive checks when
Mr T returned to borrow his fifth loan a couple of weeks after repaying his third. He was now 
repaying a total of £800 and had been indebted to Sunny for about six months at this point. 
Mr T hasnt provided his credit file or any bank statements so I have limited information 
about his financial situation or how he was managing any existing credit commitments.  I 
dont have enough information to determine what Sunny might have found out about his 
circumstances and whether it would have declined to lend to him at this point. 
Later that month Mr T applied for his sixth loan which would commit him to repaying a total 
of £950 across three loans. Mr Ts first loan was for £350 and he was still indebted to Sunny 
for an even greater amount some six months later. So it doesnt seem to me that hed 
managed to make any inroads into his debt in that time.
Sunny offered to refund the interest and charges Mr T paid on loans 14 to 22 acknowledging 
that the pattern of borrowing by that point suggested that he wasnt using its loans for short 
term needs. I agree that it was irresponsible to have granted these loans but I also think 
Sunny should have stopped lending to Mr T before then, specifically when he asked for his 
sixth loan, in other words on 25 July 2015.
Mr Ts pattern of taking out further loans when he repaid previous loans and taking out loans 
concurrently had been demonstrated by that point. This pattern suggests to me that he 
couldnt repay his debt without needing to borrow again, that he wasnt managing to meet his 
repayments sustainably and it was likely that he had an ongoing need for additional income. 
I think Sunny should have recognised this and declined to lend to him.I think Mr T lost out when Sunny agreed loan 6 and went on to agree more loans for him for 
another year and a half because these loans unfairly prolonged his indebtedness and 
allowed him to take expensive credit intended for short term use over an extended period of 
time. The number of loans he borrowed and the length of time he repeatedly borrowed over 
was likely to be seen negatively by other lenders, potentially keeping him in the market for 
high cost loans. 
Putting things right
As Ive explained above, I find that Sunny was irresponsible to have agreed further credit for 
Mr T from and including his sixth loan taken out on 25 July 2015. In order to put things right 
for him, Sunny should
a. refund all interest and charges Mr T paid on all fully repaid loans. In other words 
loans 6 to 18 inclusive and loan 20; and
b. pay interest on all these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to 
the dates of settlement; and
It seems from the account information Sunny provided that Mr T didnt fully repay loans 19, 
21 and 22. For these loans Sunny should:
c. remove any interest and charges included in the loan balances; and
d. treat any payments Mr T has made towards these loans as payments towards the 
original capital borrowed; and
e. refund any payments he made above these amounts along with 8% simple* interest 
per annum from the dates the overpayments arose to the date this complaint is 
settled; 
f. if a capital shortfall remains, Sunny can use the refund calculated in a) and b) above 
to offset this if it owns the debt and chooses to do so. If Sunny doesnt own the debt 
then it needs to work with the new debt owner to ensure Mr T doesnt repay any 
more than the capital borrowed for these loans.
g. remove all information about loans 6 to 22 from Mr Ts credit file, once settled, 
because any information recorded about them is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I am upholding Mr Ts complaint and require Elevate Credit 
International Limited trading as Sunny to put things right for him as Ive outlined.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 July 2020.
