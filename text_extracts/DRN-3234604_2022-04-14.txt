The complaint
Mrs C is unhappy that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA permanently limited her account and 
restricted access to funds within it.
What happened
Mrs C telephoned PayPal and asked whether she could open a PayPal account to run a 
raffle at work for a charity event. PayPal told Mrs C that this would be acceptable to them, 
and Mrs C then proceeded accordingly. However, PayPal then proceeded to limit Mrs Cs 
account and suspend her ability to withdraw money from the account on the basis that Mrs C 
had contravened their acceptable use policy. Mrs C wasnt happy about this, so she raised a 
complaint.
PayPal looked at Mrs Cs complaint, but they maintained that by using the account to 
administer a raffle, that Mrs had contravened their acceptable use policy, and so they didnt 
uphold Mrs Cs complaint.
Mrs C wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They didnt feel that it was fair that PayPal 
would tell Mrs C that her intended use was acceptable verbally, only to later limit go back on 
this statement and to limit the account. So, they recommended that this complaint be upheld 
in Mrs Cs favour on that basis.
PayPal didnt agree with the recommendations out forwards by our investigator, so the 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPals acceptable use policy includes a reference to a lottery contract as a prohibited 
activity. Given that a raffle is in essence a form of lottery, it seems reasonable that PayPal 
would consider this use as being in contravention of their acceptable use policy. However, it 
can be the case that a corporate policy such as acceptable use policy can be correctly 
applied in an unfair manner, and I feel that this is whats happened in this instance.
It would be expected the PayPals staff would have a clear understanding of the acceptable 
use policy. And given that Mrs C asked whether using the account to administer a lottery 
would be acceptable to PayPal  and was told that it would be acceptable  it doesnt feel 
fair that PayPal would then subsequently limit this account in the manner which they did.
If PayPal felt their staff member had given incorrect information to Mrs C, then I feel that 
PayPal should have made every effort to allow Mrs C to withdraw the money and close her 
account so that she wasnt adversely impacted by the receipt of such incorrect information.
Additionally, PayPal havent provided any compelling reason as to why they didnt provide 
such an opportunity to Mrs C here, including that PayPal havent provided any evidence of 
potential financial irregularities conducted by Mrs C on the account  which I acknowledge 
may have been difficult to provide given that it appears Mrs C was administering a raffle for 
colleagues and friends as she initially explained to PayPal that she was. 
Ultimately, PayPal told Mrs C that she could use her account to administer a lottery. And 
having been given this information by PayPal, I dont see any reason why Mrs C should have 
questioned it and not used the account in the manner which shed been told was acceptable. 
Furthermore, I cant rationalise any reason why it should then be considered fair for PayPal 
to have gone back on their word and to have applied their acceptable use policy in a manner 
which Im satisfied was unfair here as a result  including restricting Mrs Cs account and her 
access to the money within it in the manner that PayPal did.
All of which means that Ill be upholding this complaint in Mrs Cs favour. Im aware that 
PayPal have now allowed Mrs C access to the money in the account and that this has now 
been withdrawn. However, I feel that PayPal should pay 8% interest on the account balance 
on a pro-rata daily basis for the time from which Mrs Cs account access was limited to the 
date when Mrs C withdrew the money from the account. 
Finally, I will be instructing PayPal to make a further payment of £200 to Mrs C which I feel 
fairly compensates her for the trouble, upset, and inconvenience that has incurred here.
Putting things right
PayPal must make a payment to Mrs equal to the daily interest that would have accrued on 
the account balance at 8% per annum from the date that PayPal limited the account to the 
date the Mrs C later withdrew the money from the account.
PayPal must also make a further payment of £200 compensation to Mrs C.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA on 
the basis explained above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 May 2022.
