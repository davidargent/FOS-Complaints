In the most recent review  of this case, our adjudicator upheld Mr Ns complaint about loans 5 
and 6 and thought these  loans shouldnt have been given. Sunny didnt respond,  and so the 
complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr N could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN77118222the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr N could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ns complaint.
Sunny says that it enquired about Mr Ns income,  expenditure  and regular short-term  
commitments before  agreeing to lend Mr N any of the loans. And I think this was reasonable 
for loans  1  4. However, before lending Mr N loans 5 and 6 I think  Sunny shouldve  
completed a full review  of his financial circumstances, including  a review of the information  it 
had about Mr Ns borrowing history  so far. 
As our adjudicator explained, had Sunny have completed a more  proportionate review it 
wouldve realised that Mr N had taken loans 1  3 in quick succession - three loans in ten 
days. The amounts  borrowed  so far ranged from £100 to £200, but Mr Ns 5th loan was for 
£450  which is significantly larger than his previous loans. This evidence  suggests Mr N 
was not borrowing to cover a temporary shortfall  and was struggling to manage  his finances 
well. This means it was unlikely he would  be able to repay this loan or any other further 
loans. 
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 5 and 6 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr N paid on loans 5 and 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5 and 6 from Mr Ns credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr N a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN77118223my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ns complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 May 2020.
