The complaint
Mr W complains that he was badly treated by American Express Services Europe Limited 
(AESEL)  trading as American Express (Amex) over a long period of time.
What happened
Mr W had a credit card from Amex. In February 2020, the statement balance was £2019.14. 
On 23 February 2020, Mr W called Amex to say he was in financial difficulty but wanted to 
pay off the balance and close his account. The call handler took an instruction to make a 
payment from his bank account but this was declined and didnt go through. On 24 February 
2020, Amex wrote to Mr W to say his account was closed, but the balance was still owed. 
On 20 March 2020, Amex wrote to Mr W to say the account was overdue by £64. On 23 
March 2020, Mr C paid in £984 to the account. A missed payment was recorded on Mr Cs 
credit file in March 2020 and then in May 2020. 
On 15 June 2020, Amex wrote to Mr W to say his account was in arrears by £40. No 
payments were made by Mr W in July 2020, August 2020, and September 2020. On 22 July 
2020, Amex sent a Notice of Default asking for repayment of the balance of £890.10.  On 13 
August 2020, Amex wrote to Mr W to say that the payments for July 2020 and August 2020 
had been missed, and the arrears were then £85. On 14 October 2020, Mr W paid in £100  
the balance was then £808.26. On 19 November 2020, Mr W paid in £115 and the balance 
was then £663.63. On 29 December 2020, Amex issued a final demand for payment of the 
balance of £663.63 and on 31 December 2020 passed Mr Ws account to a debt collection 
agency. Various credits were then paid in over the next few months so that by June 2021, 
the balance was £251.38.
On 9 July 2020, Mr W asked Amex for a Subject Access Request (SAR). 
Mr W complained to Amex several times. He said that Amex had acted unreasonably. He 
had wanted to close his account in March 2020  but due to Amexs error, he couldnt.  And 
then, the series of missed payment markers on his credit file werent fair either. He said he 
had been sent a default notice in March 2020 which showed a balance of zero  which was 
confusing. And later, they closed his account and passed it to a debt collection agency 
without telling him. He asked for a SAR which wasnt provided in time. He said that he 
wouldnt make any more payments to Amex until his complaints had been resolved. He 
asked that all interest and charges are refunded from the time of his first complaint.
Amex sent several final responses to Mr Ws complaints. In March 2020, they accepted 
there had been a problem when they set up a payment to be made from Mr Ws bank for 
£2019.14  as it was known that Mr Ws bank may not make a payment for over £2,000. 
They couldnt say if this was an error by Amex or whether the problem lay with Mr Ws bank. 
But they made a goodwill payment of £50 and refunded the interest and late payment 
charges for the month. Initially, Amex said they wouldnt remove the late payment marker for 
March 2020, but later, in May 2020, changed their decision and agreed to remove the 
marker from Mr Ws credit file. They made a goodwill payment of £100 to his account.
In December 2020, Amex said that as a result of a call in May 2020, the late payment 
marker for May 2020 was removed from Mr Ws credit file, and a further goodwill payment of 
£50 was then made, together with a refund of the late payment fee of £12. They said that on 
a call, Mr W was correctly advised that such goodwill payments did not count as payments to 
Mr Ws account and so he still had to make payments to it himself. But they then agreed that 
on another call, Mr W had been told otherwise. 
Amex said Mr W had been advised that payments were due, including the minimum 
payment of £83 due by 8 July 2020. They noted Mr W had been given a further credit of £50 
in September 2020. They also noted that Mr W had told them on two occasions that he didnt 
intend to make any more payments. No credit had been received for 90 days and therefore 
Mr Ws account had been cancelled - in line with its terms and conditions.
Amex said to us that theyd made goodwill payments and refunds of interest and fees 
totalling £318.19, and they considered that was sufficient.
Mr W brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Amex had acted reasonably. Amex 
had responded to each of Mr Ws complaints fairly and she felt that they didnt need to take 
any more action. 
Mr W disagreed and asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman. He said he 
considered the payments made by Amex to be compensation, not goodwill payments - as 
they were due to errors by Amex.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr W has raised a number of complaints about how AMEX has dealt with this situation. For 
clarity in this decision, Ill cover each of the main points here separately  but also explain 
what my overall findings are too. For me, the main points of his complaints are:
February - March 2020  the failed payment of £2019.14 and the marker on Mr Ws 
credit file for March 2020.
Missed payment marker added to his credit file in May 2020.
Missed payments from June 2020.
Amexs decision to close his account and pass to a debt collection agency.
Amex should have supported him as he was in financial difficulty.
Data Subject Access Request
February - March 2020: I can see that Mr W called Amex on 23 February 2020 and said he 
wanted to close his account by paying off the balance. Its not clear why the payment that 
Amex set up failed  Amex couldnt say whether it was because of an error by them, or 
whether it was down to Mr Ws bank. 
He also said that Amex hadnt contacted him to say the payment had failed, but there are 
two sides to this  Mr W could also have seen from his bank account what had happened; 
and possibly tried to make the payment again himself. But, he didnt. Equally, Amex couldve 
advised Mr W what had happened, but didnt  until they responded to Mr Ws complaint on 
11 March 2020. Mr W then went on to say that he couldnt then afford to pay Amex  because hed spent the money from his bank account. But I think that Mr W must take some 
responsibility here  he could see what had happened, and therefore what the effect on his 
balance with Amex was.  But  after Mr Ws complaint about this, Amex agreed to delete the 
late payment markers from Mr Ws credit file and made a goodwill payment of £50; they also 
refunded the interest due that month and the late payment fee of £12. So  they acted fairly 
and put things right.
 Mr W also said he was sent a default notice in March 2020 which showed a balance of zero. 
Amex couldnt locate such a letter, nor could I see this in Amexs records. So, on this aspect, 
where theres no evidence of a letter being sent, its difficult to conclude that its more likely 
than not that one was.
Missed payment marker added to Mr Ws credit file in May 2020: There was a minimum 
payment of £41 due by 8 May 2020. On 5 May 2020  Amex made a goodwill payment of 
£100 to Mr Ws account. So  Mr W considered that this covered the minimum amount 
needed. But in Amexs Terms and Conditions  it says that such payments arent considered 
to be a payment to an account. And so  Amex treated this to be a missed payment and 
marked Mr Ws credit file as such. Mr W opened a complaint - and Amex accepted that he 
had been misinformed about that on a call, apologised, deleted the late payment marker, 
and made a goodwill payment of £50. And so  I think Amex did what they needed to do to 
put things right here.
Missed payments from June 2020:  I can see that Mr W didnt make any payments to his 
account between June 2020 and 14 October 2020. There was a goodwill credit of £50 on 21 
May 2020  but that didnt count as a credit payment. Although its not clear if Mr W would 
have been aware of that at that stage. But in any case, the minimum payment needed was 
£83  so that was more than the amount of the goodwill credit. And  I can also see that Mr 
W was sent a notice of arrears on 13 June 2020 to show that he was two months in arrears, 
totalling £75. So  he shouldve been aware of his situation. And so, I agree that Amex were 
entitled to notify credit reference agencies of the late payment for June 2020.
After that  there werent any credits until October 2020. I saw that Mr W advised Amex that 
he didnt intend to pay anything while his complaints were being dealt with, or until he 
received the documents under his SAR request. He emailed Amex on 13 June 2020 and 
then on 9 July 2020 to say so. I can also see that Amex wrote to Mr W on 22 July 2020  with 
a Notice of Default asking for payment of the arrears of £83 - and said Information regarding 
the status of the account will be reported to a credit reference agency where it will remain on 
record for 6 years; and wrote again on 13 August 2020 - to say that the payments for July 
and August 2020 had been missed. So  Amex advised Mr W of the situation, and the 
consequences if he didnt make the payment. And so, Amex were justified in adding late 
payment markers to his credit file for those months  as this are accurate records of the 
conduct of his account.
On 9 July 2020, Mr W emailed Amex and said: I shall no longer be making any payments to 
AMEX UK until this matter is resolved. I can, to some extent understand why he took this 
stance given all that happened here. But I have to be impartial  and in doing so I have to 
consider that while Mr W may not have wanted to make payments, AMEX were still entitled 
to ask him to, where there was a legitimate balance outstanding.
Amexs decision to close his account and pass to a debt collection agency: Mr W says he 
thought his account had been closed when he asked it to be - in February 2020. Ive seen 
Amexs letter dated 24 February 2020  it says that Mr Ws account had been closed  that 
is, deactivated  so it couldnt be used for purchases, but repayment of the balance, 
including monthly minimum amounts should be made. I think the letter was clear - the debt 
was still payable.Ive then looked at what Amex later said to Mr W. The default notice dated 22 July 2020 
said: You have failed to make your minimum payments when due as required under the 
'Repayments' section of your Agreement. To remedy this breach the payment due on your 
account £83.00 must be paid within 14 calendar days from the date of service of this 
noticeIf nothing is received, we may take legal proceedings against you for the 
outstanding balance, plus interest.Outstanding balance (as at the date of this notice): 
£890.10Your account may be referred to a debt collection agencyInformation regarding 
the status of the account will be reported to a credit reference agency where it will remain on 
record for 6 years. So, I think the letter was clear about what Mr W needed to do, and the 
consequences if he didnt.  And because Mr W didnt make the monthly payment, the full 
balance then became payable.
I looked at Mr Ws statements. The statement dated August 2020 showed that no payment 
had been made by him. And said, Please pay the closing balance of £916.75 immediately. 
The statement for September 2020 showed no payments were received and said the same 
thing  with the balance at £931.66. On 14 September 2020  there was a credit of £50 
(being a goodwill payment) but the October 2020 statement asked for payment of the 
balance of £895.49 immediately. The November 2020 statement showed that the balance of 
£808.26 was payable immediately. So  for four months, Amex advised Mr W that the full 
balance was payable  and not a minimum monthly payment. So  he should have been 
clear as to what he had to do.
Amex made the decision to make formal demand for repayment and their letter dated 29 
December 2020 asked for payment of the full outstanding balance of £663.63.your 
account may now be passed to a debt collection agency.steps may be taken to register 
the default status of your account with credit reference agencies.. On 31 December 2020, 
Amex wrote the account has been cancelled and all amounts on the account are now 
payable in fullyour account has been transferred to an external debt collection agency 
(called) xxxx. And so  Amex clearly told Mr W what was going to happen, and then the 
actions they had taken.
Financial Difficulty: When Mr W called Amex in February 2020  he said he was in financial 
difficulty. But at the same time, he said he wanted to pay off the whole balance. So - I can 
see why Amex didnt then consider a plan to help him  he had made his intentions clear. In 
March 2020  it was agreed that Amexs financial difficulty team  would call him, which they 
did, although I can see there were two failed calls. And Mr W then repaid £984 of the 
balance. And in a further call on 1 April 2020, Mr W raised a complaint and said he refused 
to pay anything to Amex. 
After that in all the notes of the calls Ive seen  Mr W didnt ask for help and assistance and 
didnt say he was in financial difficulty. If he had, then we would have expected Amex to 
consider what they could do to help  possibly by agreeing a reduced payment plan although 
any assistance a lender provides would have need to be tailored and appropriate for a 
customers individual circumstances. But I cant see that Mr W did say that or ask for help. 
Where he did communicate with AMEX, it was about his complaints and refusal to make 
payments  all of which AMEX tried to address.
SAR request: Mr W made a SAR request on 9 July 2020. On 20 July 2020, he complained 
hed not received an acknowledgment. I can see that Mr W was frustrated that he hadnt 
heard anything. But Amex did say in their letter dated 4 August 2020 that Mr Ws request 
had been received. The SAR wasnt sent until 14 September 2020  which was more than 
the one calendar month that the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) say it should take.  
Amex made a payment of £50 for that  which was a reasonable response.In his response to our investigators view, Mr W said that the payments should be called 
compensation, and not goodwill. Ive considered this. Goodwill payments are called as such 
when no error has been made by a business, whereas compensation is due when a mistake 
or error has occurred. In my decision, I didnt consider that Amex made any clear errors, and 
so I consider that the payments are goodwill payments.
In summary, I think Amex acted fairly and reasonably in dealing with Mr Ws complaints. 
They made goodwill payments, plus refunds of interest and fees totalling £308.19. And their 
actions throughout were also reasonable, and their communications sufficiently clear. Mr Ws 
actions here were clearly borne of his frustration with AMEX, but because I think it acted 
fairly on the whole  I cant ask AMEX to do any more here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 March 2022.
