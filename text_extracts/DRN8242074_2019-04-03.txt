K820x#14complaint
Mr E says Bank of Scotland  plc (BOS) mis-sold  him an Ultimate Reward Current Account 
(URCA) packaged bank  account in 2013. Hes used a Claims Management Company 
(CMC) to complain.
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr Es complaint  and didnt think that BOS  had mis-sold the 
URCA. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Es complaint.  
Having looked  through everything provided and thought about what both parties have said, 
bearing in mind Mr Es likely knowledge  of the United Kingdom banking system,  I think that 
Mr E chose to take the URCA.  As far as I can see Mr E couldve used the benefits included  
on the URCA and it was up to him to do so.
And while Im open to the possibility Mr E wasnt told everything he needed to know about all 
of the benefits,  I havent seen anything in his circumstances  to suggest that he wouldve 
been affected by any of the main limitations  or exclusions. So I dont  think clearer 
information wouldve  changed Mr Es decision and he received enough to know and 
understand what it was he was agreeing  to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Es complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 May 2019.
