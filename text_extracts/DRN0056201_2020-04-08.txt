K820x#14complaint
Miss M complains that she was mis-sold  an agreement with FCA Automotive Services UK 
Ltd.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy  of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision,  I explained  why I didnt  propose to uphold  Miss Ms complaint.
Miss M replied to my provisional decision and said she didnt agree with it.  She said she 
was currently experiencing financial difficulties. 
FCA has not replied to my provisional  decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive taken what Miss M has said into account. But Ive not seen anything which gives me any 
reason to reach different  conclusions from the ones I set out in my provisional decision.
my final decision
For these reasons, as well as those  set out in more detail in my provisional decision, my final 
decision is that I dont  uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 May 2020.
