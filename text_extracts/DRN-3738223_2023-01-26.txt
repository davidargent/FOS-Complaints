The complaint
Mr J complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, trading as Barclaycard, wont refund to him the 
money that he paid for a holiday club membership. Hes being represented in his complaint 
by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr J and his wife entered into a membership agreement to buy a holiday club membership in 
July 2007. The total membership fee was $71,910, they made down payments totalling 
$25,353 and agreed to make 48 monthly payments of $969.93 to the holiday company. Mr J 
says that some of those monthly payments were made using his credit card with 
Barclaycard. 
Mr Js representative made a claim to Barclaycard in August 2019 under sections 75 and 
140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 - but Barclaycard says that it didnt receive the claim. 
Mr J then complained to this service and has provided evidence to show that between 
November 2008 and March 2009 he had made payments to the holiday company using his 
Barclaycard credit card. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Js complaint should be upheld. He said that the 
total price of the contract was $71,910 which exceeds the cash price limit for a claim under 
section 75. He also thought that Mr Js claim could also be fairly declined by Barclaycard on 
the basis that it was made too late.
Mr Js representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It said that Mr J wished to challenge our investigators recommendations and 
was in the process of preparing a response  but no further information has been received.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Js complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
Mr Js then representatives claim letter to Barclaycard that was sent in August 2019 
referred to claims under sections 75 or 140A but the claims made in the letter related 
mainly to misrepresentations made by the holiday company and the letter concluded 
that Mr J claimed the sum of $71,910, including interest, pursuant to section 75  the 
letter didnt claim that there was an unfair relationship between Mr J and Barclaycard 
and I dont consider that a claim under section 140A was made;
Mr Js then representatives letter to this service, which included Mr Js complaint 
form, referred to section 75 and I dont consider that a complaint about Barclaycards 
response to a section 140A was made;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
one of those criteria is that the claim must relate to a single item to which the supplier 
has attached a cash price not exceeding £100 or more than £30,000;
the membership fee under the membership agreement was $71,910 so the cash 
price for it exceeded £30,000 and Mr J isnt able to make a claim under section 75;
even if the membership fee was within those limits, the Limitation Act 1980 says that 
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim is six years from the date on which the 
cause of action accrued (which is when everything needed to make a claim had 
occurred); 
I consider that Mr J would have been able to make a claim to the holiday company or 
Barclaycard about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife into 
buying the timeshare in July 2007 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made so I consider that his cause of action 
accrued at that time;
Mr J would then have had six years from July 2007 to bring a misrepresentation 
claim against either the holiday company or Barclaycard  but his claim under section 
75 wasnt made to Barclaycard until August 2019, more than twelve years later which 
was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that any such 
claim would now be time-barred;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
I dont consider that a claim has been made that there was an unfair relationship 
between Mr J and Barclaycard so I make no finding on that issue (but from what I 
have seen, I wouldnt be persuaded that Mr Js relationship with Barclaycard was 
unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an 
unfair relationship between them); and
I sympathise with Mr J for the issues that hes described with the membership and 
the health issues that his wife has suffered, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Barclaycard to refund to him any of the money that he 
paid under the membership agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Js complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 February 2023.
