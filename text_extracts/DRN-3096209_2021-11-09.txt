In a document submitted to her representative Mrs T said shed taken loans with STFL from 
2007. But neither STFL or Mrs T were able to give us any information or records of any 
loans before December 2015. Mrs T has told us that she repaid all her loans using a bonus 
from work. 
One of our adjudicators thought that without more information she was not able to come to 
any conclusions about loans 1 to 6. But she did think that from loan 7 STFL ought to have 
ceased lending and she gave her reasons why. 
STFL disagreed. Mrs Ts representative has acknowledged the adjudicators view but not 
added anything further. 
The complaint remained unresolved and was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about high-cost credit lending, including 
all the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
STFL needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs T could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure.
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate. But certain factors might point to the fact that STFL should 
fairly and reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the 
consumer. These factors include:
having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a level of income);
having many loans and/or having these loans over a long period of time (reflecting 
the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or 
was becoming, unsustainable);
coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. STFL was required to establish whether 
Mrs T could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. The 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulatory body and it issued the Consumer 
Credit Sourcebook (CONC) in which sustainable is defined as being the ability to repay 
without undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments.
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that. I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information 
provided in this context and what this all means for Mrs Ts complaint. 
Mrs T has not added anything further following our adjudicators view and so I take it from 
that, the issue surrounding loans 1 to 6 are not disputed. So, I have looked at the overall 
pattern of STFLs lending history with Mrs T, with a view to seeing if there was a point at 
which it should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise 
harmful. And so STFL ought to have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further 
loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mrs Ts case, I think that this point was reached by loan 7 and 
I say this because:From loan 7 Mrs T was provided with a new loan within days (often the same day) of 
settling a previous one and sometimes she was issued with two loans in one day. So 
STFL ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs T was having to borrow 
further to cover the hole repaying his/her previous loan was leaving in her finances 
and that Mrs Ts indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mrs T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed STFL. The two loans 
she took in November 2018 were three years after her first loan and the combined 
loan amount (£600) was three times as much as her first. Mrs T had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to STFL over an extended period.
I think that Mrs T lost out because STFL continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ts indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the sheer number of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mrs Ts ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about loans 7 to 17 and STFL should put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STFL should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Mrs T from loan 7, as Im satisfied it ought to have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs T may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real 
and substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Mrs T in a 
compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Mrs T would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. 
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFLs liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right.
STFL ought to do as follows: 
refund all interest and charges Mrs T paid on loans 7 to 17;pay interest of 8% simple a year* on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 7 to 17 should be removed from 
Mrs Ts credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires STFL to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mrs T 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Ts complaint in part and I direct that Short Term 
Finance Limited does as I have outlined above.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 December 2021.
