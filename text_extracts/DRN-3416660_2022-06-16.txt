The complaint
Mr D complains that MBNA Limited wont refund to him the money that he paid for some 
holiday club memberships.
What happened
Mr D and his wife entered into a trial membership agreement with a holiday company in May 
2006 for the right to reserve five holiday weeks within the following 34 months with a holiday 
company. The price of the membership was £3,495.30 which Mr D paid using his MBNA 
credit card in June 2006. They traded-in their trial membership in April 2007 and entered into 
an acquisition agreement with the holiday company to buy holiday club membership points. 
They agreed to pay £23,000 to the holiday company and Mr D made the payment in June 
2007 using his MBNA credit card. Mr D says that he also paid another £2,000 to the holiday 
company in May 2006.
Mr D made a claim to MBNA in August 2018 under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974 and said that the membership had been misrepresented and mis-sold to them. MBNA 
said that there was a break in the debtor-creditor-supplier chain that was required for a claim 
under section 75 so he didnt have a valid claim against it. Mr D wasnt satisfied with its 
response so complained to this service. 
Our adjudicator considered that there was a relevant debtor-creditor-supplier relationship but 
our investigator thought that Mr Ds misrepresentation claim under section 75 was made 
outside of the time limits in the Limitation Act 1980. She also considered whether Mr D could 
make a claim under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  but she thought that even if 
MBNA had considered his claim under section 140A it would have been fair to turn it down 
because it was made too late.
Mr D has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that his 
cause of action accrued in March 2015, when a court in the country in which the holiday club 
was based ruled that the contracts were unlawful. He says that the methods used to sell the 
contracts were based on high pressure sales technics and deceitfulness which constitutes a 
breach in contract which would only have been recognised when the actual unlawfulness of 
the contract was registered in March 2015. He says that his understanding is that there isnt 
an actual timeframe limit under which a claim under section 75 can be made and that the 
Limitation Act doesnt apply to his claim. He says that the two biggest selling points of the 
holiday club were exclusivity and availability  both of which are proven to be untrue.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ds complaint is that MBNA turned down his section 75 claim and he referred his 
complaint to this service within six years of the event that hes complained about  
which is the turning down of that claim - but I need to consider whether the Limitation 
Act applies to any claims that he would otherwise have;
Mr Ds claim is made under sections 75 but in this decision Im not determining the 
outcome of that claim as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering 
whether or not MBNAs response to his claim was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ds claim under section 75 is that the holiday club membership was 
misrepresented to him and his wife and that they wouldnt have entered into the trial 
membership agreement and the acquisition agreement if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them  and he also says that theres been a breach of contract by 
the holiday company;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, MBNA would be expected to 
consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time limits set out in 
the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and 
to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr D could have made a claim to the holiday company or MBNA about 
the misrepresentations that he says induced them into buying the trial membership 
and then the holiday club membership points soon after they entered into those 
agreements as that was when Mr D says that they entered into the agreements 
based on the misrepresentations of the holiday company and suffered a loss as Mr D 
used his credit card to pay for the memberships;
I consider that Mr Ds cause of action accrued at about that time, so he would have 
had six years from April 2007  which was when he entered into the acquisition 
agreement - to bring a claim against either the holiday company or MBNA  but he 
didnt make a claim against MBNA until August 2018, which was more than eleven 
years later and outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider 
that any such claim is now time-barred under the Limitation Act;
Mr D says that he only became aware that he could make a claim to MBNA after the 
court judgment in March 2015  but when he had the knowledge to bring a claim 
doesnt assist him for the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim 
under some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have 
knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that 
those sections are applicable to Mr Ds claims;
the time limit for a breach of contract claim in these circumstances is also six years 
from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which is when everything 
needed to make a claim had occurred); Mr D made his section 75 claim to MBNA in August 2018 in which he said that, at the 
beginning he and his wife were quite happy with the service but later on problems 
started and the quality of the product and customer service started quickly 
decreasing - but he would only be able to make a claim under section 75 for any 
breaches of contract about which hed become aware in the six years since August 
2012;
Ive not seen enough evidence to show that Mr D became aware of what he says 
were the breaches of contract after August 2012 and I consider it to be more likely 
than not that he first became aware of the issues with the quality of the product and 
customer service, including exclusivity and availability, before that date  and I 
consider that any such claim would also now be time-barred under the Limitation Act;
MBNA would only have liability under section 75 for any breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the holiday company - Im not persuaded that the court 
judgment in March 2015 constitutes a breach of contract for which MBNA would be 
liable under section 75;
Mr Ds August 2018 claim letter to MBNA referred to the holiday companys high 
pressure and aggressive sales techniques so Ive also considered whether Mr D 
could have made a claim under section 140A;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years  but where a credit card is used to make the payment I 
consider that the time for limitation purposes runs from when the credit used to make 
the purchase has been repaid;
the most recent payment that Mr D made to the holiday company for the 
memberships was the £23,000 that he paid in June 2007 - MBNA has provided 
evidence to show that Mr D made a payment of £24,363.73 to his account in July 
2007 which repaid the credit that he used to pay the holiday company - so I consider 
that Mr D would have needed to make a claim against MBNA within six years of July 
2007  but he didnt make a claim to it until August 2018, more than eleven years 
later, which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider 
that any such claim is now time-barred under the Limitation Act;
MBNA didnt consider Mr Ds claim under section 75 as it said that there was a break 
in the debtor-creditor-supplier relationship  but as I consider that any claims that 
Mr D might have against MBNA are time-barred under the Limitation Act, I dont 
consider that theres any need for me to assess whether or not there was a relevant 
debtor-creditor-supplier relationship in these circumstances;
I consider that MBNA should have considered whether Mr Ds claims were time-
barred but it didnt do that so I cant say that its response to his claims was fair and 
reasonable  but I consider that it wouldnt have upheld the claims if it had properly 
considered them as it would said that they were time-barred; and 
I sympathise with Mr D for the issues that he and his wife have had with their holiday 
club memberships and the difficulties that hes described, but I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require MBNA to refund to Mr D 
any of the money that he paid for them, to pay him any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 July 2022.
