The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his credit card 
account without notice.
What happened
Mr M had a credit card with NatWest since 2016 with a limit of £4350. In June 2020 NatWest 
sent him a Notice of Default. In August 2020 a default was registered. The debt was passed 
to a debt collection agency.
Mr M complained that he wasnt aware the account would be cancelled  he hadnt been 
told. And, when he called NatWest in 2019, he was told the account wouldnt be closed.
NatWest said Mr Ms account had been cancelled. They didnt have to tell Mr M why his 
account was stopped. There hadnt been any payments since February 2020. Many letters 
had been sent to Mr M to say what was happening to his account and asking for payments. 
A Notice of Default was sent in June 2020  giving 21 days to bring the account up to date, 
but no payments were received. A termination notice was sent in July 2020. A default was 
registered in August 2020. They didnt have any record of the call in November 2019  but at 
that time, they wouldnt have known that payments would later stop.
Mr M brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said NatWest had acted reasonably. She 
saw the last payment was made in February 2020 and then a Notice of Default was sent in 
June 2020  this was fair, given the lack of payments made by Mr M. This was then followed 
by a Notice of Termination in July 2020 and the default was registered in August 2020. She 
considered that Mr had been advised of what was happening  and letters had been sent to 
Mr Ms address they held on their file. Regarding the call Mr M made to NatWest in 2019  
this wasnt particularly relevant as Mr Ms payments stopped later than that  in February 
2020.
Mr M asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Ms complaint is that he wasnt aware that NatWest were going to cancel his account and 
take the actions they did. They didnt tell him why they did what they did either. He says he 
called them in November 2019 and they then told him that all was OK, and his account 
wouldnt be closed.
Ive looked at what happened, and I think NatWest acted fairly here. I can see from Mr Ms 
statements that up until 2020, Mr M maintained his credit card account satisfactorily  
borrowing was within the limit, and monthly payments  usually more than the minimum  
were made on time. But things changed from February 2020  I dont know why. But the last 
payment was made on 28 February 2020  and nothing was received into the account for 
the rest of 2020. I can see several letters were sent to Mr M in February 2020, March 2020 
and May 2020  which said he was in arrears and asking for payments. A Notice of Default 
was sent on 10 June 2020 and this asked for payment within 21 days  nothing was 
received. NatWest sent a termination Notice on 2 July 2020. This said A Default Notice has 
recently been served against you. As the amount requested in the Default Notice has not 
been received, your account has been terminated. Further letters dated 31 July 2020 and 
28 August 2020 were sent. The default was formally registered on 20 August 2020. Mr M 
had said that NatWest didnt explain why they cancelled his account  but Im afraid that they 
dont have to do that  and its their commercial decision to take those decisions if they wish. 
But  the letter of termination does say why the account was cancelled  because no 
payments had been made. 
So  I think NatWest gave Mr M sufficient communications as to what was going on.
Mr M told us he didnt receive the letters  but I can see they were sent to his address they 
held in their records, so must conclude they were delivered there. Mr M told us that he called 
NatWest in November 2019 and was assured that all was OK, and his account wouldnt be 
closed. Theres no record of that call  but in any case, I dont think its relevant as, at the 
time, it looks as though his account was operating satisfactorily  and NatWest could only 
have commented on the situation at that time  it was later, in February 2020  that the 
payments stopped.
NatWest have told us that Mr M can still make arrangements with their debt collection agent 
to pay his debt (which was £3348.03 in December 2020). I can see that the debt collection 
agent wrote to him in April 2021 about this  and I suggest its a good idea that Mr M gets in 
touch with them.
So  my decision is that NatWest acted fairly, and I wont be asking them to do anymore 
here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2021.
