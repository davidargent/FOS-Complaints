The complaint
Mr H complains that Home Retail Group Card Services Limited, trading as Argos Card, wont 
pay for his faulty oven to be replaced and reimburse him for the costs that hes claimed.
What happened
Mr H used credit provided by Argos Card to pay for an oven that he bought in December 
2018. He says that the oven developed a fault in April 2020 so he contacted the retailer and 
then Argos Card. Argos Card said that the fault had developed after the twelve month 
guarantee provided by the retailer had ended so it wasnt required to take any action  but it 
also said that if he was able to provide a report from an independent engineer that said that 
there was a manufacturing defect with the oven it would be able to consider his claim further.
Mr H wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator said 
that he didnt have enough evidence to conclude that the oven was faulty due to an inherent 
defect or wasnt of satisfactory quality, or to show that there had been a misrepresentation or 
a breach of contract.
Mr H has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He says that the oven 
stopped working properly after about fifteen months, he only wanted it to be repaired but 
hes now had to buy a replacement oven.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Hs complaint about Argos Card, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the oven 
and that Argos Cards response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or 
reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Hs claim under section 75 
as only a court would be able to do that;
in a complaint such as this the breach of contract would be that the oven wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was bought by Mr H or that the supplier had breached its 
guarantee of the oven;
Mr H has described the issues that hes had with the oven since it stopped working 
properly in April 2020  and hes referred to poor reviews about the oven and the 
difficulty of getting spare parts  and he says that hes had to replace the oven;
the supplier guaranteed the oven for twelve months and, if it had developed a fault 
during that period, it would have been responsible for repairing or replacing the faulty 
oven  but the issue with Mr Hs oven didnt start April 2020, more than fifteen 
months after hed bought the oven, and by then the suppliers guarantee had ended;
I dont doubt what Mr H has said about the oven not working but hes provided no 
detailed evidence, such an engineers report, to describe the fault or to show that 
theres a manufacturing fault with the oven or that it wasnt of satisfactory quality 
when he bought it;
Argos Card has said that it would we able to consider Mr Hs claim if he provided an 
independent engineers report showing that there was a manufacturing defect with 
the oven  but Mr H hasnt provided such a report;
I sympathise with Mr H for the issues that hes had with the oven and for the costs 
that hes incurred in replacing it and in making calls to the supplier and Argos Card, 
but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
I consider that Argos Cards response to Mr Hs claim has been fair and reasonable 
in these circumstances and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that its acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mr H about the oven; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require Argos Card to refund to 
Mr H the money that he paid for the oven, to reimburse him for the cost of replacing 
the oven or for the call costs that hes incurred, to pay him any other compensation or 
to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 April 2021.
