The complaint
Mr S complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA closed his account and hasnt 
explained why.
What happened
In early 2021, PayPal placed a permanent restriction on Mr Ss account, limiting all activity. 
Shortly after this PayPal closed the account and Mr S made a complaint.
PayPal said it was satisfied that it had followed the correct internal processes and 
procedures and had acted in accordance with its user agreement. It was not in a position to 
disclose the reasons behind its actions for security reasons. 
Mr S remained unhappy and asked our service to look into his complaint. Our investigator 
looked into Mr Ss concerns but didnt think his complaint should be upheld. He said he was 
satisfied from the information PayPal had provided that it had acted fairly and reasonably. 
He didnt think PayPal needed to reactivate Mr Ss account or take any other action.
Mr S disagreed with our investigators view. He said he believed he had done nothing wrong 
and hadnt committed any of the offences listed in PayPals user agreement. He questioned 
how he could defend himself if nobody could tell him what the allegations against him were. 
He said he believed this was a failure of an automated system and that PayPal needed to 
get a human being to examine the case. So, the complaint has been passed to me to 
decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ss complaint. Ill explain why.
PayPal says it decided to close Mr Ss account after carrying out a review. It told Mr S that a 
review can include many variables including assessing transactions, activities on any linked 
accounts (including numbers of buyer claims, transaction activity, etc.) and the history of 
accounts, etc.
Its referred to wording in its user agreement that lists some of the actions it might take if it 
believes a customer has engaged in any restricted activities:
Terminate this user agreement, limit your account, and/or close or suspend your account, 
immediately and without penalty to us.
Refuse to provide PayPal services to you in the future
I appreciate Mr Ss frustration that PayPal hasnt told him precisely which restricted activities 
it believes hes engaged in. But its not obliged to do so. 
Unfortunately, Im also not able to share the information PayPal has provided our service 
with Mr S. This is to avoid disclosing information that is commercially sensitive or might be 
helpful for anyone who might want to evade or circumvent PayPals policies.
PayPal has made a commercial decision to stop doing business with Mr S, and this isnt 
something our service can interfere with. However, Ive considered if PayPals actions were 
fair and reasonable. Having considered the evidence, I think PayPal reached its decision to 
restrict and then close Mr Ss account reasonably and in good faith. From what Ive seen, Im 
satisfied that PayPal has followed its processes and the terms of its user agreement. So, it 
follows that I dont think PayPal has done anything wrong.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 June 2022.
