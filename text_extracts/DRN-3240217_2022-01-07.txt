The complaint
Mr F and Ms L complain about problems theyve experienced since changing their mortgage
with Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays). 
What happened
Mr F and Ms L have a mortgage with Barclays. On 3 April 2020, the balance was 
£354,305.75. They had a two-year fixed rate of 1.32% which expired on 30 April 2020. 
Monthly repayments were £1,443.76. The original mortgage offer in April 2018 included a 
fee of £899 which was added to the loan. Using an independent mortgage broker, they 
agreed to a further fixed rate and on 3 April 2020, Barclays issued an offer of a two-year 
fixed rate of 1.21% through to April 2022. Monthly repayments were shown in the offer as 
£1,418.11 and the booking fee was £999, which was added to the loan. The new lower 
repayments were to start in May 2020. On 4 April 2020, Barclays sent to Mr F and Ms L a 
revised payment notification (RPN) which said payments were increasing to £1,448.61 in 
May 2020, followed by further payments of £1,447.61  at an interest rate of 1.32% until 30 
April 2020, after which the rate would go to 1.21%. Mr F and Ms L are represented by Ms Ls 
father, but I will refer to them as the complainants in this document.
Mr F and Ms L complained about several things:
that the repayment to the mortgage go up in April 2020  when the interest rate 
was reduced from 1.32% to 1.21%. The revised payment notification couldnt be 
correct. They believed this may have been caused by the fee of £999 which was 
included in the repayment amount. They said the offer letter dated 3 April 2020 
was misleading as to whether the fee of £999 was added to the loan, or not.
The fee of £999 was too much as it amounted to £41.62 over 24 months  when 
the interest saving on the difference between the two fixed rates was only around 
£25 a month.
 They called Barclays several times but couldnt get an explanation. And - they 
couldnt understand Barclays final response at all. They wanted Barclays to set 
out the calculations for the monthly repayments before and after April 2020.
In their final response, Barclays said the difference in payments was because their 
mortgages operate using two balances  the loan balance and the calculating capital 
balance. They apologised that they couldnt resolve things when Mr F and Ms L called 
them and offered compensation of £100 for that.
Mr F and Ms L brought their complaint to us. Two of our investigators looked at what had 
happened, and both considered that Barclays had acted fairly. I wont detail their views 
here as I dont think that helps the understanding of this complaint. But following several 
discussions with Mr F and Ms L, and detailed emails between them, Barclays and us, F
and Ms L remained unhappy and asked that an ombudsman look into their complaint.
I issued a provisional decision where I said:
Ive looked at what happened here and unfortunately, things became confused during Mr F 
and Ms Ls original complaint, and during our investigation. I hope I can explain more clearly 
what happened here. I should say that Mr F and Ms L were making larger repayments than 
needed - £1,600 a month, but that isnt relevant to the substance of the complaint, as they 
wanted to understand what their contractual position was.
Changes in repayments:
Mr F and Ms L were on a two-year fixed rate of 1.32% which was due to end on 30 April 
2020. They then chose a new two-year fixed rate of 1.21% through to 30 April 2022.
Barclays issued their offer letter on 3 April 2020 which detailed this. It said the new 
interest rate would start on 1 May 2020 and the new monthly repayments would be 
£1,418.11. The fee was £999. So  I can see thats what Mr F and Ms L expected to see 
happen.
But I think what then happened confused matters. Barclays then sent a revised payment 
notification (RPN) dated 4 April 2020 which said that the payment due in May 2020 was
£1,448.61  this said the change was because of a withdrawal of £999 on 3 April 2020. 
But the rate quoted on the RPN was still 1.32% - the existing rate  because it wasnt to 
change until 1 May 2020. Its also clear that Barclays debited the booking fee of £999 to 
the mortgage and that caused the RPN to be issued. But the RPN was based on the 
existing interest rate  so the new payments of £1,448.61 werent going to continue, other 
than for May 2020. Which is what happened  a repayment of that amount was due in May 
2020. I can see that on page 2 of the RPN, it said After 30/4/2020, a fixed interest rate of 
1.21% applies until 30/4/2022. Barclays then sent another RPN on 1 May 2020 which said 
the new payments would be £1,417.64 in June 2020 and £1,419.36 thereafter. So  that 
showed the up to date situation  after the new fixed rate was applied. And  I can see that 
the repayments of that amount were then made in line with the RPN.
I can see how this must have been confusing for Mr F and Ms L  but I hope that Ive 
explained this now.
During our investigation, Mr F and Ms L asked about the fee of £999  and whether that 
caused the increase in repayments. For the arrangement of the old fixed rate period 
ending in April 2020, a fee of £899 was added to the loan. And, for the new fixed rate 
starting on 1 May 2020, the fee of £999 was also added to the loan. This was included in 
the offer letter dated 3 April 2020  it says Product fee (you have chosen to add this to 
the mortgage)£999These payments are based on a balance at the 03 April 2020 of 
£354,305.75 and include the fee(s) that are shown in the interest rate and other costs 
section as being added to your mortgage. And I can see thats what happened  on the 
mortgage statement, the fee of £999 was debited to the mortgage on 3 April 2020. Its 
true that the payments wouldve increased because of this  because the amount of the 
loan went up by £999. But also  Mr F and Ms L had agreed the terms of the offer which 
set that out.
Fee of £999:
Mr F and Ms L have said they paid the fee of £999 but it wasnt worth it  as the saving 
between the two fixed rates was less than the fee which cost £41.62 a month (over 24 
months). But I can see that the fixed rate was arranged through their mortgage adviser  
the offer letter said (mortgage advisor) recommends, having assessed your needs and 
circumstances, that you take out this mortgage. Barclays is not responsible for the advice 
or information you received. So  any questions they have about the fee, and the 
suitability or how cost effective the new mortgage rate was, must be addressed to the 
mortgage adviser. Its not for me to say what level fees should be set at. But I would also say that its not reasonable to make a comparison of cost savings by comparing the two 
fixed rates. The booking fee enabled Mr F and Ms L to lock in a fixed rate of 1.21% for two 
years  and I would say that the saving should be compared to Barclays standard 
mortgage rate at the time  as that was the alternative. And  the offer letter dated 3 April 
2020 says this was 3.59%. So  thats what the rate of 1.21% should be compared against.
Barclays response:
Mr F and Ms L have asked Barclays to set out their calculations of the repayments before 
and after the April 2020 changes. I think that was because theyd couldnt get any clear 
answers to their questions. Barclays said its too complex to do, as it would be a manual 
calculation and involve some assumptions about the remaining mortgage term, 
outstanding balance, interest rate and the amount of payments to be made. I have some 
sympathy with that  and I hope that now Ive set out things clearly that wont be needed. I 
would also add that we arent auditors, and due to our informal nature, we cant 
forensically investigate whether an account is exactly correct. But based on what weve 
seen, we havent seen any errors.
However, its unfortunate that Barclays couldnt explain what had happened when Mr F and 
Ms L called them. And the final response that Barclays sent in September 2020 didnt help 
either  as it only confused matters and caused Mr F and Ms L to ask more questions. It 
said that the difference in repayments was caused by the way they operated their 
mortgages  by using two different balances  the loan balance and the calculating 
capital balance.
I must say I found that confusing  as did Mr F and Ms L. And it didnt deal with their 
complaint. And  if Barclays had been clearer when the questions were first asked, then 
there may not have been any need for this complaint. And so  what then took place was 
that Mr F and Ms L took a lot of time in calling Barclays to try to understand what had 
happened. Theyve been in detailed email and telephone contact with us frequently  since 
September 2020. This has taken a lot of their time and has been inconvenient  but 
equally, I havent seen that its caused a lot of worry and stress, nor has it caused any 
financial loss. But, I think its reasonable that Barclays should pay compensation of £250 
for the inconvenience that this has caused  that is the amount of time committed to trying 
to understand what had happened here. I think this is in line with what our service would 
expect to see here. This is to include the £100 that Barclays originally offered. Its unclear 
whether Barclays has already paid the £100 offered so Id appreciate it if Barclays would 
confirm this in their response the provisional decision.
Responses to the provisional decision.
Barclays didnt comment, but Mr F and Ms L did. They said:
The offer letter relating to the previous mortgage didnt include that the booking fee of 
£899 was added to the loan; whereas the offer dated 3 April 2020 did make for the 
adding of the fee to the loan. So they said the terms of the previous offer were 
unclear about whether the fee was to be added or not, and whether the repayments 
included it.
The repayments were only reduced from £1448 per month to the lower amount when 
they complained to Barclays.
I now need to make a final decision.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered the additional points made by Mr F and Ms L. 
Booking fee: I looked again at the offer letter dated 7 March 2018. This says loan amount 
£380,780.31, plus £899 for fees that will be added to the loanproduct fee (you have 
chosen to add this to the mortgage) £899.  Page 2 (section 6) then quotes the amount of 
the loan as £381,679.31 (i.e. including the fee of £899)  with the repayments calculated on 
that amount. I also looked at the mortgage statement and this also confirms the fee of £899 
was added to the mortgage  on 16 March 2018. This was therefore included in the capital 
amount owed and reflected in the repayments. The same happened in the mortgage offer 
dated 3 April 2020  this says Product fee (you have chosen to add this to the mortgage) 
£999. And the mortgage statement shows the fee was debited to the loan on 3 April 2020.
So  I consider this to be clear, and the two offer letters were also consistent with each 
other, and in the treatment of the fee. 
Reduction in repayments: I think my explanation in the provisional decision under Changes 
in repayments details what happened. Im happy that the sequence of RPNs issued by 
Barclays was part of their processes, and wasnt caused calls made by Mr F and Ms L.
And so  I am not going to depart from my provisional decision and for the reasons I gave in 
it.
Putting things right
I am asking Barclays to pay compensation of a total of £250. This to include the £100 
already offered. Unfortunately, Barclays havent let us know if the £100 has or hasnt been 
paid, and they will need to decide on this when making the payment. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. And Barclays Bank UK PLC must:
Pay Mr F and Ms L total compensation of £250 for inconvenience.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F and Ms L to 
accept or reject my decision before 4 February 2022.
