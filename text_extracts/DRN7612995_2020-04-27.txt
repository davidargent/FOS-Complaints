K820x#14Complaint
Mr B complains National Westminster Bank  Plc unfairly prevented  access  to and closed his 
current account. He says this caused him significant  inconvenience and distress and thinks  
NatWest should  compensate  him to the sum of Â£25,000.
Background
Mr B held a current account with NatWest. He is also the director  of a limited  company, 
which held two other accounts with NatWest; a business current account and a business 
savings account.
On 19 April 2019 Mr B says he noticed he couldnt access his personal account or his 
companys accounts.  NatWest had placed a stop on the accounts in order to review the 
activity that had taken  place  on them. The blocks were removed after several  weeks,  
allowing Mr B access  to them again.
NatWest then decided  to close Mr Bs personal  account, and company accounts. It sent him 
a letter  dated  30 April 2019, giving him 60 days notice to make  alternative banking 
arrangements.
Mr B was very unhappy  with NatWests decision and actions. He complained separately to 
NatWest about the freezing of his accounts  and their subsequent closure. NatWest  rejected 
both complaints. It says it had frozen  and taken  the decision  to close each account in line 
with its terms  and conditions. As a result,  Mr B brought his complaint to us.
During the time the complaint was with our service Mr B opened  another account with a 
third-party bank. He attempted to use the account  switch guarantee to switch his accounts 
over, but NatWest  prevented  the switch going  through. He says he was unable to access  the 
funds in his account again but was eventually  able to transfer his balance on 17 July 2019 - 
although he says he was charged a fee for doing  this.
Mr B says he has suffered  a great  deal at the hands  of NatWest. He says hes incurred  
multiple charges  as a result of missing payments such as direct debits, his company has 
experienced cashflow problems, he lost out on a holiday, his credit file has been affected,  
and his mental health and well-being  were  affected.
An investigator at our service considered Mr Bs complaint and decided  not to uphold it. In 
summary they found:
-NatWest has a variety of legal and regulatory obligations it must meet when  providing  
accounts to its customers. So, it hadnt acted unfairly when reviewing his accounts 
and freezing them while it did so. Although Mr B was no doubt concerned by not 
having access to his accounts and may have  suffered financial loss and 
inconvenience as a result, this didnt mean NatWest were wrong to take the actions it 
did.
Ref: DRN76129952-NatWest are able to take a commercial decision not to continue a relationship with 
one of their customers, in the same way a customer may decide to end their 
relationship with it. What  was important was that NatWest had acted in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of Mr Bs accounts, which  it had.
-NatWest had shown  they hadnt charged  Mr B a fee for transferring  his balance to his 
new bank account.
Mr B was very unhappy  with this outcome. He thinks NatWest should be liable for the 
financial loss he and his company experienced, as well as the inconvenience and distress he 
was personally caused.  He has asked  for a final decision  by an ombudsman, so his 
complaint has been passed to me to decide.
Before I discuss my findings and decision  I must make clear  that this decision only 
addresses the removal of access  and subsequent  closure of Mr Bs personal  current 
account. The reason for this is the other  accounts Mr B had mandate over were in the name 
of his limited company.  Under the rules we must follow, his limited  company is a different 
complainant to Mr B. So, I have  addressed  the reasonability of NatWests  actions in relation 
to the companys accounts in a separate final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive decided not to uphold  
Mr Bs complaint for much  the same reasons given by the investigator previously. Ill explain 
why.
Removing access to Mr Bs account
NatWest has extensive  legal and regulatory obligations it must meet when providing account 
services to customers, both new and existing. And to fulfil these responsibilities NatWest 
may need to review  an account to understand more about the activity taking place on it and 
take proportionate action  while they do, which may mean temporarily removing a customers 
access to the account.
I can see NatWest prevented Mr B from accessing his account  on two occasions; firstly, in 
April 2019, and then in July 2019 while he was trying to transfer funds to his new account 
with another bank. I understand  that on both occasions Mr B mustve been very concerned  
about why he couldnt access his account,  and Ive no reason to doubt he experienced some 
financial loss during this time, and that his well-being was affected. I was sorry to hear about  
what he says he went through, and he has my sincere sympathies. 
But Ive looked  at all the information  available and Im satisfied NatWest actions in 
temporarily removing  access were reasonable  and I understand why it did what  it did. So, I 
wont be asking NatWest  to pay Mr B any compensation  for financial loss or distress  he was 
caused by being unable  to access his account.
I understand too that Mr B initially  tried to transfer his account via the current account  switch 
guarantee. But NatWest  are under  no obligation  to permit an account switch through the 
guarantee. The terms of his account  do permit NatWest to refuse instructions of this type  
and again I understand why it made this decision, and I think  it was justifiable.
Ref: DRN76129953Account Closure
NatWest can decide  not to continue its relationship  with Mr B, in the same way he couldve 
decided he no longer wished to transact  with NatWest. Its decision to do so is not something 
we would generally interfere with, as this would impinge on NatWests freedom to decide  
who it wants as a customer, including its existing customers.
NatWest should,  however, ensure  its applied  the correct terms in closing a customers 
account; and it shouldnt close an account based on an improper reason. The relevant  terms 
required NatWest to give 60 days notice  to make alternative arrangements before closing 
Mr Bs account. 
Mr B says he started the switching process  four days prior to the date his account  was 
meant to close. And he says he asked NatWest for an extension to allow him to transfer his 
funds after this. NatWest  hasnt confirmed an extension was granted,  but nonetheless  I can 
see he had over 60 days to make alternative banking  arrangements, and eventually did so. 
Given the account terms and Mr Bs circumstances, Im satisfied he had an appropriate  
amount of time to make other arrangements, and I cant see he was charged  a fee for 
transferring his balance to his new account.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive given above,  Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Bs complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 May 2020.
