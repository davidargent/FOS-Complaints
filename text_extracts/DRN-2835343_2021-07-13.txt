The complaint
Mrs U complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wont refund to her the money that 
she paid for a mobile phone and wont pay her the compensation that shes claimed.
What happened
Mrs U used a credit account with PayPal to pay Â£310.87 to a supplier for a mobile phone in 
December 2018. She made a claim to PayPal in March 2020 under its buyer protection 
policy that the phone was significantly not as described because the speaker was inaudible 
when making or receiving calls and the phone was getting incredibly hot when charging. It 
said that the issues werent covered under its buyer protection policy. 
Mrs U wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that her complaint should be upheld but he said that she might be able to make 
a claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Mrs U made a claim to PayPal 
under section 75 but it said that there wasnt sufficient evidence that the phone was faulty 
when she first took ownership so it denied her claim.
Mrs U then complained to this service that PayPal had denied her section 75 claim. A 
second investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. She said that 
there wasnt enough evidence to prove that the phone wasnt of satisfactory quality when it 
was supplied so she didnt think that PayPal had done anything wrong by declining Mrs Us 
claim.
Mrs U has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has responded 
in detail and says, in summary, that:
theres an implied term that the quality of the phone is satisfactory  which it isnt;
the expected useable life of electrical items should be at least six years;
she contacted the supplier about the condition of the phone in January 2019 and it 
offered a return, but details were not sent and followed up;
shes provided a repair report which states that the phone has the following faults: 
speaker is inaudible, battery capacity is 66% and battery constantly heats up  and 
she says that its not her fault that the report isnt dated but no repairs were carried 
out; and
she wasnt able to get a report earlier than she did because of the government 
imposed restrictions in response to the pandemic.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigators for these reasons:
Mrs U bought the phone, using credit provided by PayPal, in December 2018 and 
she made a claim to PayPal under its buyer protection policy in March 2020  more 
than 14 months later;
it didnt uphold her claim under its buyer protection policy and Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that it acted incorrectly in denying her claim at that 
time;
Mrs U then made a claim to PayPal under section 75 - in certain circumstances, 
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Us complaint about PayPals response to her claim under 
section 75, I must be satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier of the phone and that PayPals response to her 
claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the 
outcome of Mrs Us claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
the breach of contract about which Mrs U is complaining is that the phone wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to her  and satisfactory quality also covers 
durability which means that the phone and the components within it must be durable 
and last a reasonable amount of time;
she says that she complained to the supplier about the faults with the phone six days 
after she bought it and that it said that she could return it but details werent sent and 
followed up;
Ive not seen any documentary evidence to show that the supplier had agreed that 
Mrs U could return the phone and, if the supplier had agreed that she could return it, I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have done more to return the 
phone to the supplier at that time;
in her March 2020 claim to PayPal under its buyer protection policy, Mrs U said: that 
shed contacted the supplier but it had  ignored [her] correspondence and are 
refusing to help  if the supplier had agreed that she could return the phone I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect her to have referred to that in her 
claim to PayPal;
Mrs U has provided a report which has described faults with the phone and says: 
speaker is inaudible, battery capacity is 66% and battery constantly heats up  but 
that report is undated;
Mrs U says that she wasnt able to get a report earlier than she did because of the 
government imposed restrictions in response to the pandemic  but those restrictions 
didnt start until March 2020;
I consider it to be likely that there are faults with the phone but the report was made 
more than 14 months after the phone was supplied to Mrs U and Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that those faults were present when the phone 
was supplied to her;nor am I persuaded that the phone wasnt as durable as it was reasonable for Mrs U 
to expect it to be and I dont consider that there was any requirement for the phone to 
last for at least six years;
Im not persuaded theres enough evidence to show that the phone wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mrs U so I dont consider that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
I sympathise with Mrs U for the issues that she has with her phone but I consider that 
PayPals response to her claim has been fair and reasonable in these circumstances; 
and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require PayPal to refund to Mrs U 
the cost of the phone, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Us complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs U to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2021.
