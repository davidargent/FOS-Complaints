K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) wouldnt process a 
chargeback claim for him as it said he was out of time.
background
Mr B has a current  account with NatWest.  He carried out two transactions  to pay for a sound 
system. Statements from NatWest suggest these payments were made on 3 March 2016  
(£1,255.74) and 28 April 2016 (£1,199.73).  He said he expected  to receive  the sound system  
in September  2016.
NatWest said that Mr B got in touch with it in December 2018 to raise a chargeback claim, 
stating the goods hadnt been received. NatWest looked into Mr Bs concerns  and said it 
couldnt raise a chargeback. It said, based  on when  the transactions took place and when he 
got in contact, he was out of time. Mr B was unhappy with NatWests  response so referred 
his complaint to us.
Our investigator looked at Mr Bs complaint and found that hed raised  a chargeback  outside  
the applicable timescales. Mr B didnt agree with our investigator.  He said he had evidence  
to support that hed raised a chargeback claim within the timescales given as hed made 
contact with NatWest in June 2017.
Following further investigation  into the new evidence provided, our investigator still didnt 
uphold the complaint. He presented Mr Bs new evidence to NatWest  and it replied  saying 
that Mr Bs contact did relate to a chargeback but was in relation  to a completely different 
transaction. Our investigator was satisfied, based  on the evidence hed seen, that the 
contact from around June 2017 related  to a separate transaction and that the chargeback for 
the sound system  was still out of time.
Mr B still disagreed with our investigator. In summary, he said he was given an initial delivery 
date in September 2016. It was then delayed until December 2016, and then until January 
2017. He was then told to wait longer by the merchant but still nothing happened  which  he 
said led to his contact  with NatWest in June  2017. Mr B believes he raised his chargeback 
claim in time and thinks that NatWest should  compensate him for not proceeding with this.
 
So the complaint has been passed  to me to decide.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Visas chargeback rules  allow 120 days from the date the transaction  was processed,  or 120 
days from the last date the cardholder expected  to receive the merchandise  or services, for 
a dispute to be processed. But the rules add that this cannot exceed 540 days from the date 
of the original transaction. 
From the information I have, it appears that the item was paid for in full by 28 April 2016. So 
the dispute would need to have been  processed by 20 October  2017.  But NatWest  said the 
chargeback claim was raised  in December 2018 which is significantly outside of this 
timescale. 
Ref: DRN78526962Mr B said he made contact with NatWest  in June 2017 to pursue a chargeback in relation  to 
the sound system   which would most likely  have  been within the applicable timescales.  But 
Ive seen NatWests  system  notes  and Im persuaded  that this contact related to an entirely 
separate transaction. It would  appear that Mr B called NatWest  in May 2017  to raise a 
chargeback claim and the amount  was refunded in July 2017 as the claim was successful. 
But I havent been given any persuasive  evidence from Mr B to suggest  that he made  
contact in relation  to the sound  system  transactions around this time, or any time prior to 20 
October 2017.  
So, overall, Im satisfied NatWest has correctly  applied  the Visa chargeback  scheme time 
limits and that its decision not to raise a chargeback was reasonable. As I havent  found 
anything to show NatWest  has made  an error in this case, I wont  ask it to take any further  
action. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 November  2019.
