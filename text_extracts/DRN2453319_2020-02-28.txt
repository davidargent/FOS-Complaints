Mr and Mrs B complain  that Clydesdale Bank Plc gave them unsuitable  investment  advice.
background
In January 2018, Mr and Mrs B complained to Clydesdale  that it had given them  unsuitable 
investment advice.
Mr and Mrs B referred to nine different investment references numbers and, in summary, 
said:
They  came into an unexpected windfall of £1,200,000  in November 1999.
Theyd  previously  only held money  on deposit and had no knowledge or experience of 
risk-based investments. However, within weeks they were  advised by Clydesdale  to 
invest around £500,000 in unsuitable  investments.
They  were aware the investment portfolio contained an element of risk, and could  go 
down as well as up in value.  However, the investments were unsuitable because  they 
were advised  to take them out so soon after a significant change  in their personal 
circumstances (the unexpected windfall); the complexity  and level of risk involved  
Mr B was medically retired and Mrs B worked  part-time, so theyd never  be able to 
replace the lost capital;  and also due to their overall  circumstances.
They  didnt have the chance to establish  what effect the prevailing rates  of interest  
would have on their money before being encouraged  to place it in a long-term 
risk-based product.
Clydesdale didnt think Mr and Mrs B had brought their complaint in time, and it said the 
complaint wasnt, therefore, one we could consider. However, I issued a decision on 
20 January 2020  explaining why I was satisfied the complaint was brought  in time  and is, 
therefore, a complaint we can consider.
I then sent Mr and Mrs B and Clydesdale  my provisional decision on the merits of 
Mr and Mrs Bs complaint on 7 February 2020  explaining why I was not intending  to uphold 
the complaint.  I said that before I made  my final decision, Id look at anything the parties sent 
me, so long as I got it by 21 February 2020.
Mr and Mrs B and Clydesdale  did not make  any further submissions in response to my 
provisional decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have reached  the same  conclusions, and for the same reasons, as 
explained in my provisional decision  dated  7 February 2020. Ive explained my reasons 
again below.
Ref: DRN24533192Clydesdale has sent us paperwork that records investment  advice it gave Mr and Mrs B in 
1999 and 2001. I havent seen evidence that persuades me Clydesdale  gave Mr and Mrs B 
investment advice at any other times (besides  in 1999 and 2001), so my comments  will be 
focused on these  two occasions  where I can see advice was given.
1999
The paperwork from 1999 records that Mr and Mrs B wished to invest  £500,000 from their 
recent unexpected  windfall,  for capital growth,  whilst  providing  £1,000  monthly income, net, 
over the medium to long term ie 5 years plus.  I also understand that Mr B had recently 
retired, that Mr and Mrs B had a joint combined  annual income of approximately £15,000, 
and that they owned  unmortgaged property  worth £172,000 and £60,000, and held cash of 
£1,016,000.
The paperwork records  that on a scale  of one to ten, where  one was defined as Guaranteed 
return of capital  inflation proofed , and ten was defined as Highly  Speculative, 
Mr and Mrs B were  recorded as having  as attitude to investment risk of seven, defined as 
Above average risk  with examples of potentially appropriate investments given as 
Capital Growth Funds, Actively Managed  Global  Funds in Diversified  Markets , and UK 
Equity Funds.
The paperwork lists the recommendations  Clydesdale made  as follows:
Investment Amount (£)
Fidelity European  Maxi ISA 7,000
Perpetual European  Growth Maxi  ISA 7,000
Jupiter UK Growth Unit Trust 21,500
Schroder UK Equity Unit Trust 21,500
Scottish Widows  European Unit Trust 21,500
Newton Managed Unit Trust 21,500
Clerical Medical Classic  With Profits Bond 100,000
Scottish Widows  With Profits Bond 100,000
Prudential With Profits  Bond 100,000
Norwich Union Flexi Bond 100,000
Total 500,000
Ref: DRN24533193Ive thought carefully in light of all of the circumstances whether Im satisfied Clydesdale 
provided suitable advice here. I appreciate that Mr and Mrs B have said theyd only ever held 
money on deposit before  something I have no reason to doubt. And I accept that they were  
most likely inexperienced investors. 
Im not persuaded, however, that I can say Clydesdale  gave Mr and Mrs B unsuitable advice 
here because of their circumstances.  I dont think the recommendations were inconsistent  
with Mr and Mrs Bs recorded attitude to risk. And Im not persuaded from what Ive seen that 
Mr and Mrs Bs recorded attitude to risk isnt most likely a fair indication  of their attitude  to 
investment risk at the time. Mr and Mrs B had just come into a very sizeable windfall of 
£1,200,000. And they werent  proposing  to invest the entire windfall   but actually  less than 
half of it, with a significant  amount of cash (over  £500,000) still available  after the 
investments were made.  This meant that Mr and Mrs B had a significant  cash  buffer to fall 
back on should they require cash in the short to medium term. So overall,  I think  
Mr and Mrs B were  prepared to take some risk with the investments and that Clydesdale  
most likely did not provide  Mr and Mrs B with unsuitable advice here.
2001
Paperwork from 2001 records that Mr and Mrs B wished to make an investment of £14,000 
to achieve potentially greater growth  than available from ordinary savings accounts over the 
medium to long term, i.e. 5 years plus, whilst also investing a further  £20,000 to provide 
maximum monthly income to supplement  Mrs Bs loss of salary.
On a scale of one to ten, where  one was defined as Guaranteed return of capital  inflation  
proofed, and ten was defined as Highly Speculative, Mr and Mrs B were recorded  as 
having as attitude to investment risk of eight, defined as High  Risk  with examples of 
potentially appropriate  investments given  as Smaller Company Funds , Special Situations, 
Recovery Funds and Specialised Funds.
The paperwork lists the recommendations  Clydesdale made  as follows:
Investment Amount (£)
Norwich Union With Profits Bond 20,000
Invesco European  Growth Maxi  ISA 7,000
ABN Amro UK Growth Maxi ISA 7,000
Total 34,000
I appreciate that Mr and Mrs B were recorded as having a higher attitude  to risk here than in 
1999. And its perfectly possible  this accurately reflected the risk they were prepared to take 
with these investments  in 2001. But in any event, bearing in mind the nature of their 
recorded objectives in 2001, what Ive said previously, and the nature of the investments  
Clydesdale recommended, Im not satisfied I can say what  Clydesdale  recommended here 
was unsuitable  for Mr and Mrs Bs circumstances.
Ive thought carefully about everything Mr and Mrs B have said. But for the reasons Ive 
explained above, this doesnt  change my decision.
Ref: DRN24533194my final decision
For the reasons  explained above, I dont  uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision  before  28 March  2020.
