Mr P complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid and as Pounds  to Pocket, 
(CEN) lent to him irresponsibly.

Reading the email correspondence between  Mr P and CEN many of these loans were 
extended and in some  instances several  times over. CEN explained to Mr P in the email  
correspondence what an extension  meant:  
An extension allows you more time to pay back your loan principal; youll only need 
to pay a finance charge on your current due date.  Your loan principal and a finance  
charge will be due on your following pay date. Extending your loan does not reduce 
the total amount due on your following pay date.  No new funds  are issued when you 
extend your loan.
CEN did not think that we could look at some  of the early loans due to a time issue but that 
element seems to have  been resolved. So I do not plan to address that aspect. 
Mr Ps representative says that CEN  failed to carry out affordability assessments effectively.
Mr P informed CEN of his financial hardship in January  2014  and the FlexCredit  sum of £600  
drawn down was arranged to have  been repaid in instalments  from 28 February 2014. 
Additional funds were  approved for Mr P in August 2014 (£50 and £200 on the same  day) 
Ref: DRN52619132plus several grants of additional funding during the whole of September  2014. Mr P informed 
them of his financial hardship again on 28 October  2014. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint and all of the loans approved  for Mr P and 
thought that Mr Ps overall pattern of borrowing suggested hed become dependent on the 
short-term loans offered  by CEN  by Loan  4. He thought that CEN should put things right for 
Mr P in relation to Loans  4 to 13. 
CEN disagreed. It repeated points it had made  earlier  in the complaint  process  relating to its 
view that the checks  carried  out were  proportionate. It challenged the adjudicators  view 
because of the lack of consideration of the particular  circumstances for each loan and 
lending decision.  
The complaint remained unresolved and so was passed to me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
CEN needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr P could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CEN  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CEN was required to establish 
whether Mr P could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
Ref: DRN52619133the case. This is because sustainable was defined as being without undue  difficulties  and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having  to borrow  to meet  the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint.
CEN has not sent to us the results of the credit checks it says it carried out for each loan.  It 
often did not have any information about the applicants expenses  and credit commitments 
as declared by those  applicants.  Mr Ps applications were no exception to this. 
Mr P had told CEN that he earned about £1,600  net each month, and CEN did not have any 
details about his expenditure until March 2015  which was after these loans being considered 
had concluded.  It had very little to assess each of Mr Ps loans at the times of his 
applications. And yet now CEN is saying that it is not possible to come  to the opinion we did 
without analysing whether the specific repayments for each loan were made without undue 
difficulty over the life of each loan out of his income  and/or  savings.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of CENs lending history with Mr P with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which CEN should reasonably have  seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so CEN should have realised that it shouldnt  
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
Loan 4. I say this because:
Loan 3 was extended several times and repaid many months after its original due 
date, and then Loan 4 was applied for and approved on the same day Loan 3 was 
repaid, and Loan 4 was the fourth  loan application in ten months. When all the 
extensions were  included it was more like the ninth or tenth time that Mr Ps 
circumstances had been assessed.  From  this its relatively clear  that Mr P was not 
able to make these loan repayments  and as CEN will be aware, these sort of high-
cost short term loans  were not meant to be used for lengthy periods. 
the picture by the time Mr P was applying for Loan 4 was not one of a customer 
finding it easy to maintain  the repayments and as such its relatively easy to conclude 
that Mr P was not one to whom  loans like these  ought to have been approved. 
Mr P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed CEN. The FlexCredit  
account (Loan 13) was taken out over three years after his first loan. And the limit 
was for a larger amount followed by the first draw down request for £600 being the 
largest amount  requested to date. Mr P had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to CEN over an extended  period.
approvals for additional drawdowns  were approved  many  times after Mr P had 
informed CEN of his financial difficulties. 
I think that Mr P lost out because CEN continued  to provide borrowing from loan four 
onwards because:
Ref: DRN52619134these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Ps ability  to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for these  
high-cost loans.
So I am upholding the loans from 4 to 13. 
putting things right  what CEN needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on Loans 4 to 13;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement ;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 4 onwards means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  Loans 4 to 13 should be removed from 
Mr Ps credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CEN to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr P a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ps complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
should do as I have set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 September 2019.
