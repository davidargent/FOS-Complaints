The complaint
Mr Bs complaint is that Black Horse Limited has not paid him compensation for payment 
protection insurance (PPI) sold with two loans with account numbers ending 573 and 971.
What happened
On 15 June 2020 Black Horse wrote to Mr B. In its letter it said it had already reviewed his 
complaints about PPI. The letter said it had issued final response letters in April 2013 and 
March 2012.
On 2 July 2020 Black Horse wrote again to Mr B to say it was upholding his complaint about 
PPI sold with loans ending 573 and 971. The letter offered Mr B compensation totalling 
£1,599.32. 
On 19 September 2020 Mr B wrote to Black Horse to complain that he had telephoned Black 
Horse to say he had not received the offered amount. In the letter he said he was told during 
the call that  the letter of 2 July 2020 was a mistake and he was not due any compensation.
Mr B asked this service to step in.
At first Black Horse told this service it had issued a cheque in 2013 to Mr B that had not 
been cashed. It agreed to re-issue the cheque. Later Black Horse said it had found evidence 
that the cheque had been cashed in 2013 and Mr B had therefore already received his 
compensation.
An adjudicator from this service thought Black Horse had already paid Mr B in May 2013 and 
didnt need to do anymore.
Mr B disagreed with the adjudicators findings so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive decided not to uphold this complaint and Ill explain why.
Black Horse says it made an error in its letter of 2 July 2020 and that it had already paid     
Mr B in May 2013 for the mis-sale of PPI with loans ending 573 and 971. So this service 
asked for evidence of this.
Ive seen a letter from Black Horse to Mr B dated 24 April 2013 offering compensation of 
£1,599.32 for loans ending 573 and 971.
Black Horse has sent us a copy of an acceptance form that accompanied the letter dated    
24 April 2013. I can see it has been  signed by Mr B and dated 10 May 2013.
Black Horse has also sent us a copy of its internal records which show a cheque for 
£1,602.66 was raised on 24 May 2013. The payee is named as Mr B and the account 
number is the loan ending 573.
The amount of £1,602.66 would have been the original offer with some additional interest 
added.
Ive also seen another screen shot of Black Horses internal records which show the cheque 
was cashed on 30 May 2013.
I do accept Mr B cannot recall receiving the cheque, but I must take into account that the 
events took place seven years ago and memories do fade. It is also unclear to me why Mr B 
wouldnt have contacted Black Horse in 2013 if he had not received the compensation he 
accepted and signed for.
Mr B has sent in bank statements from May 2013 which do not show a deposit for the 
amount of £1,602.66. But its possible Mr B may have paid the cheque into a different 
account. 
Taking all this into account, the available evidence persuades me that it is most likely Mr B 
did receive the cheque in May 2013 and that it was cashed. So I think Mr B received 
compensation for the mis-sold PPI in May 2013.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint and make no award against Black 
Horse Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 June 2021.
