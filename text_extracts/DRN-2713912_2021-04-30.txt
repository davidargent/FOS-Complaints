DRN-2713912
The complaint
Mrs H and her daughter complain that National Savings and Investments (NS&I) havent 
paid whats owed on two Childrens Bonus Bonds.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. The 
facts are not in dispute so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The lack of any bond certificates, records with NS&I, or past letters to Mrs H about 
the bonds makes it more likely than not that the bonds werent set up in 1996.
There isnt enough evidence to say why the bonds werent set up, or whether NS&I 
ever cashed cheques Mrs Hs mother gave them to set up the bonds.
The amount of time thats passed makes it reasonable for NS&I not to have any 
record of what happened after Mrs Hs mother sent them the two cheques. 
As theres no evidence of NS&I doing something wrong here, its not fair to ask them 
to do anything more to resolve this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons above, Ive decided not to uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 May 2021.
