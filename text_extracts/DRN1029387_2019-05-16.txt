K820x#14complaint
Mrs T says HSBC  UK Bank Plc (HSBC)  mis-sold a Plus packaged bank  account  to her in 
2008. Shes used  a Claims Management Company (CMC) to make her complaint. 
background
Our adjudicators looked into Mrs Ts complaint and didnt think  HSBC  had mis-sold the 
packaged account. The CMC asked for an ombudsmans review.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mrs Ts complaint. Having done so, I dont think  HSBC mis-sold the Plus 
account to Mrs T. Id like to explain why I think thats  the case. 
Fee free accounts  are widely  available in the United  Kingdom. And I think that Mrs T 
wouldve known she couldve had a free account  with HSBC if thats what  she wanted. 
I dont think the Plus account  was recommended to Mrs T. So it was up to Mrs T to decide if 
it was right for her. Mrs T used some of the benefits   such as the preferential  overdraft 
rates, fee free overseas cash withdrawals - and couldve used others - such as the travel 
insurance - too. 
Im open  to the possibility Mrs T wasnt told absolutely everything she needed  to know  about  
all the benefits.  But Ive not seen  anything to suggest she wouldve been  affected by the 
main limitations or exclusions. So I dont think clearer information wouldve made a 
difference and I think Mrs T was given enough  to understand what she was agreeing to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mrs Ts complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs T to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 June 2019.
