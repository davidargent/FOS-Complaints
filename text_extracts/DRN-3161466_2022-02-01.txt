The complaint
Mr E complains on behalf of E, a charity. He would like PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to 
close the charitys PayPal account.
What happened
In February 2021, Mr E attempted to open a PayPal account for the charity. He told us:
He originally wanted the account so the charity could receive donations through 
PayPal.
During the application process, PayPal asked him to provide a debit or credit card 
number for the charity. He could not do so, because the charity does not have any 
plastic cards (and does not wish to apply for any).
PayPal then applied a limitation to the charitys account, meaning that the account 
could not be used. PayPal told him it would remove the limitation as soon as he 
provided identity evidence in the form of a credit or debit card number for an account 
in the charitys name. That isnt something he is able or willing to do.
He and his fellow trustees decided they no longer wanted a PayPal account for the 
charity, and asked for it to be closed. PayPal said it would not close the account 
unless the trustees first provide a credit or debit card number for an account in the 
charitys name. Again, that isnt something Mr E is able or willing to do.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, and recommended that PayPal close the 
charitys account. He noted that no money had ever gone into or out of the account, and he 
thought the most pragmatic way forward was simply to close the account. 
PayPal did not accept our investigators conclusions, on the grounds that it is obliged to 
verify the identity of its customers in accordance with applicable law. It also said that 
allowing the closure of the account without Mr E confirming his identity would assist in 
possible circumvention of the PayPal system.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There is some dispute about whether the charitys PayPal account was ever fully opened. It 
is possible that it was not fully opened (because that could not happen without a credit or 
debit card number). It is also possible that it was fully opened and then restricted before any 
transactions could take place. But in either case, no money has ever gone through the 
account, no money has ever changed hands, and there is no money in the account now.
I acknowledge that PayPal has a number of obligations towards its customers, and that it 
must verify the identities of those who use its services. But the charity has not in fact used its 
services, and does not intend to do so in future. I think it is entirely understandable that Mr E 
is concerned about the existence of an inaccessible PayPal account in the charitys name, 
and he is right to want to close it.
I can also understand why Mr E has described the situation as a catch 22. From his 
perspective, he cannot open the charitys account without a plastic card in the charitys name 
 but he also cannot close the account without such a plastic card. I acknowledge that 
PayPal has other concerns about the lack of identity evidence for the other trustees, but 
there is no benefit in Mr E resolving those concerns; even if he did so, the issue over the 
charitys lack of a plastic card would still remain.
Mr E told us that he and his fellow trustees no longer want a PayPal account for the charity  
in other words, they no longer want the charity to be PayPals customer. In the overall 
circumstances here, I consider that the most appropriate resolution to this complaint is for 
the charitys PayPal account to be closed. That means that neither the charitys trustees nor 
anybody else will be able to pay money into a PayPal account in the charitys name, and 
similarly nobody will be able to withdraw money from a PayPal account in the charitys 
name.
I have no reason to suspect that Mr E did not have authority from the other trustees to 
attempt to open a PayPal account for E. But even if he didnt have such authority, I see no 
disadvantage to E or the other trustees in this account being closed. If this account has been 
set up without the proper authority, then it should be closed. But even if it has been set up 
with proper authority, it should still be closed  because that is what the trustees want. There 
is no question of the account closure leading to the charity losing money, because the 
account does not contain any funds.   
Putting things right
PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must fully close Es PayPal account.
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must fully close Es PayPal 
account.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask E to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2022.
