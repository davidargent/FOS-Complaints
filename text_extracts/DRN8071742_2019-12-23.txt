K821x#15complaint
Miss R complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) was 
irresponsible to lend to her.
background
Miss R had eight loans from Sunny between September 2015  and July 2016 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 1 Sep 2015 £500 6m £144.91 26 Feb 2016 11 Oct 2015
2 24 Sep 2015 £250 6m £75.12 24 Mar 2016 11 Oct 2015
3 27 Oct 2015 £300 6m £88.83 28 Apr 2016 On time
4 20 Nov 2015 £500 6m £153.05 27 May 2016 On time
5 7 Jun 2016 £150 6m £42.23 28 Nov 2016 28 Jul 2016
6 24 Jun 2016 £100 6m £30.28 28 Dec 2016 26 Aug 2016
7 7 Jul 2016 £150 6m £42.32 28 Dec 2016 26 Aug 2016
8 28 Jul 2016 £350 6m £104.07 27 Jan 2017 9 Sep 2016
Miss R says the initial loan was extended  without reassessing her financial situation. She 
says she was already  in a debt management plan at the time but Sunny continued to lend to 
her despite  the fact she couldnt afford the repayments and was already  in financial 
difficulties.
Sunny says it carried out creditworthiness and affordability checks  before each loan, even  if 
Miss R had existing loans with it. It says it asked Miss R about her income and expenditure 
and used information from credit reference  agencies. It adds that Miss R applied  for 13 
loans, but it only approved  the eight that met its lending criteria.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She found that, by loan 6, 
Miss Rs pattern of borrowing suggested that the lending was unsustainable.  Our adjudicator  
recommended that Sunny  should  refund  interest  and charges on loans 6 to 8 (plus 8% 
statutory interest) and remove loans  6 to 8 from Miss Rs credit file.
Sunny responded to say, in summary,  that Miss Rs repayments were always a small 
percentage of her disposable income and that there was no evidence  she was in financial 
difficulty.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss R could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN80717422But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss R could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer 
could sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. 
This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook  (CONC) defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Rs complaint.
Loans 1 to 4
Im satisfied that Sunny carried out enough  checks before it approved loans 1 to 4. It asked 
Miss R about her income  and expenditure and her minimum disposable income during that 
time was £975. As the highest scheduled repayments in any month were less than £250, I 
cant conclude Sunny was wrong to find these loans  affordable.
Loan 5
By the time Miss R applied for loan 5, she had been  borrowing  from Sunny  almost 
continuously for over 9 months. Because of this, and the number of loan applications, I 
consider Sunny should have carried out a full financial review  before agreeing  to further 
borrowing. I cant see it did this, but loan 5 was the smallest loan to date and there is nothing  
in the available information that suggests Miss R was having difficulty  managing  her money.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN80717423Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Rs case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
Loan 5 was still outstanding when Miss R applied for loan 6 and the balance  owed to 
Sunny had started to increase again;
Miss R been borrowing from Sunny for almost  ten months by this stage;
From  loan 6 onwards  Miss R was provided  with a new loan within  2 or 3 weeks  of a 
previous application. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely than not 
Miss R was having to borrow  further to cover the hole repaying  her previous loan was 
leaving in her finances and that Miss Rs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss R wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 8 was 
taken out 11 months after Miss Rs first. It was for the second  largest  amount in the 
loan chain and loans 6 and 7 were still outstanding. Miss R had paid large amounts 
of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Miss R lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Rs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss Rs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 8 and Sunny should  put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading  as 
Sunny) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Miss R paid on loans 6 to 8;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 8 should be removed from 
Miss Rs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 23 January 2020.
