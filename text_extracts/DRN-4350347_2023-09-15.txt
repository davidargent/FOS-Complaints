The complaint
Mr B complains that Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) failed to refund transactions he says he 
didnt make from his account and that it failed to provide support after informing it of his 
gambling concerns. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat everything 
again here. Instead, I will provide a brief summary and will focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
Mr B disputed a number of transactions made from his Lloyds account on 9 and 11 January 
2023, totalling £175.94 that he says he didnt authorise:

The first transaction of £32.79 Mr B disputed was refunded to his account on 24 January 
2023, but he said he didnt have access to these funds as the subsequent disputed debit 
card transactions made from his account used up this credit. Lloyds subsequently offered to 
refund this amount again to settle the matter.
Lloyds also offered to refund the debit card payments of £16.82 and £16.85 (with associated 
transactions fees). These were shown to have been authorised on 11 November 2022 using 
the correct CVV number, but there was a delay in the merchant requesting the payment, 
which was why it wasnt debited until January 2023. However, it nonetheless offered to 
refund them as compensation for failing to previously trace the payments. On top of this, 
Lloyds also offered a further amount of £80 compensation in recognition of the distress and 
inconvenience caused by its handling of the matter. 
In terms of the remaining disputed debit card payments, Lloyds said it wouldnt be refunding 
these and provided evidence to show that the payments had been made to merchants that 
Mr B had paid before.
After Mr B disputed the transactions, Lloyds also took the decision to close his account, 
giving 60 days notice, but Mr B says he wasnt able to access any of his money during this 
period. He also says it failed to provide him with adequate support when he informed it of 
problems he was having with gambling. 
Our investigator upheld Mr Bs complaint. She said that Lloyds hadnt provided sufficient 
evidence to show how four of the disputed payments made to the merchant Lottoland had 
been authorised. So, on top of Lloyds original offer of £148.46 (including its £80 offer of 
compensation) our investigator said that Lloyds should also refund the four disputed 
payments to this merchant totalling £66.
In terms of Mr B informing Lloyds of his concerns about gambling. Lloyds said it hadnt been 
made aware of any gambling issues, and our investigator also couldnt find any evidence of 
Mr B having raised this with the bank. So, she didnt think it had failed to provide adequate 
support.
However, Lloyds conceded that Mr B had complained about this on 16 January 2023, which 
it failed to investigate at the time and instead treated his complaint as one relating to his 
account closure, which wasnt what Mr B was ultimately complaining about. As a result, it 
offered £150 compensation in recognition of the distress and inconvenience caused by its 
handling of the matter, which our investigator thought was fair. 
Our investigator also thought that Lloyds could have handled things better with regards to 
the closure of Mr Bs account and recommended it award a further £150 to recognise the 
likely distress and inconvenience caused. 
Lloyds agreed to pay all of the redress as set out above in order to settle the complaint, but 
Mr B disagreed as he felt that further compensation should be awarded. As he didnt agree, 
the matter has been escalated to me to determine. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr B has put forward a considerable number of submissions in relation to his complaint, 
which Id like to reassure him I have read in their entirety. There are many points that he has 
raised in his complaint about Lloyds, and I have addressed what I consider to be the crux of 
his complaint. 
Having reviewed all the evidence, I agree with the conclusions and settlement proposed by 
the investigator, which Im satisfied is fair for the reasons set out below:
Disputed transactions
Lloyds has since offered to refund the disputed transactions of £32.79, £16.82 and £16.85 
along with any associated transaction fees. Following further recent involvement of our 
investigator, Lloyds has also agreed to refund all the disputed payments made to Lottoland 
on 11 January 2023, totalling £66. So, given Lloyds has either refunded or agreed to refund 
these payments, I dont think its necessary to comment on them any further. I will instead 
focus on those that Lloyds has chosen not to refund.
The outstanding disputed payments Lloyds hasnt agreed to refund consist of two online 
card transactions made to C-Rewards on 11 January 2023 for £10 and £30. Mr B says his 
account was blocked at the time and so it couldnt have been him who made the 
transactions. Lloyds has explained that the payments were originally authorised on 
9 January 2023, and the sale was then completed on 10 January 2023. However, his debit 
card was subsequently blocked on 10 January 2023, which meant that Lloyds had to put the 
payments through manually on 11 January 2023. 
Lloyds has shown that these payments were authenticated by the payer inputting the CVV 
code, which has shown as a match. I havent been provided with any plausible explanation 
to demonstrate how anyone other than Mr B would have known his CVV number. So, on 
balance, Im satisfied its more likely than not that these payments were authorised by Mr B, 
and I dont think Lloyds has acted unfairly by refusing to refund them. 
In terms of compensation for the handling of Mr Bs payment dispute, Lloyds offered £80. I 
accept that Lloyds handling of the matter could have been better. He was given incorrect 
information, such as being told he couldnt raise a fraud claim because his account was due 
to be closed. But while I appreciate this would have been frustrating, Im satisfied the amount 
of compensation offered for this is a fair and reasonable reflection of the distress and 
inconvenience likely caused in these circumstances.  
Account closure
As part of Mr Bs complaint, Ive also considered Lloyds decision to close his bank account 
and whether it has acted fairly and reasonably in this regard. 
Having considered the evidence, Im satisfied that Lloyds has fairly exercised its discretion to 
close Mr Bs account, but Im not satisfied with the way in which it has handled the closure. 
Lloyds says the decision to close the account was made on 10 January 2023, giving Mr B 60 
days notice, where the account was eventually closed on 20 March 2023. However, I can 
see there was another letter sent to Mr B on 17 March 2023 saying he had 60 days notice 
from this point, which must have been quite confusing for Mr B. 
Also, despite Lloyds saying it gave Mr B 60 days notice, it did not allow him access to his 
funds and said it was only going to pay from any pre-existing bank giro credits paid into the 
account. Overall, Im not persuaded Lloyds has acted fairly in these circumstances; it shouldve at least allowed him access to the funds in his account, and it also caused 
confusion about how much notice Mr B had and when his account was to be closed. 
In light of Lloyds handling of Mr Bs account closure, our investigator recommended a further 
award of £150, which Lloyds has agreed to pay. I appreciate that Mr B may not consider this 
to be commensurate to the experience he has had. And Id like to assure him that I have 
considered everything he has said about the impact this had on him at the time. But overall, 
taking into account the amount of money that was left in the account, Im satisfied that £150 
represents fair compensation for the distress and inconvenience likely caused, so I wont be 
making any further award. 
Gambling concerns
Mr B has also raised concerns about Lloyds as he said it failed to provide adequate support 
when he informed it of problems he was having with gambling
I can see that Mr B informed Lloyds of his disabilities in January 2019. But I havent seen 
any evidence to demonstrate that he informed Lloyds of any gambling issues, so it therefore 
cannot be said that it failed to provide him with adequate support. I appreciate that his 
account was used for gambling. But Im not persuaded there would have been any cause for 
concern for Lloyds in this regard, as the transactions do not indicate signs of a gambling 
problem or using credit to fund the transactions, for example. 
However, Lloyds have conceded that it failed to address Mr Bs concerns about this when he 
originally raised it with them as a complaint on 16 January 2023. I can see that on this date 
he told Lloyds that he believed they had failed to safeguard him from gambling, but it failed 
to look into these concerns until our service became involved. I appreciate this would have 
been frustrating for Mr B and would have made him feel that he wasnt being heard. 
However, Lloyds have offered £150 compensation, which I also think is a fair reflection of the 
distress and inconvenience likely to have been caused by its poor handling of the matter. 
In summary, I appreciate that Mr B feels strongly about his complaint and that he has been 
treated unfairly. But while I agree that Lloyds could have handled things better, Im satisfied 
that the settlement proposal it has agreed to is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances 
in order to put things right.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct Lloyds Bank PLC to pay total 
redress of £514.46, being made up of the following amounts:
£134.46 in refunded transactions; and
£380 compensation in recognition of the distress and inconvenience caused to Mr B.
Mr B should note that if he accepts my decision, it will be legally binding on all parties, and 
he probably then wouldnt be able to take legal action over this matter for additional 
compensation. If, however, he rejects the decision, although his legal rights will remain 
intact, itll purely be a matter between Mr B and Lloyds as to whether the £514.46 settlement 
remains open for acceptance. Strictly speaking, an offer is not binding on the offeror after 
rejection of it has been communicated. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2023.
