The complaint
Miss S complains about how National Westminster Bank plc (NatWest) handled a Direct 
Debit indemnity claim. 
What happened
In June 2021, Miss S contacted NatWest to make a Direct Debit indemnity claim under the 
Direct Debit guarantee. This was because she said she hadnt received prior notification 
from her energy supplier, which Ill call B, about a change to the amount being debited from 
her account. 
NatWest credited Miss S account with the amount of the Direct Debit. But later debited this 
amount from her account when B defended the indemnity claim with evidence that Miss S 
had been sent notification. Miss S raised a second indemnity claim, but the same thing 
happened  the refund was later taken back after B defended it.
 
Miss S was unhappy that NatWest had taken the refund back and that they hadnt notified 
her they were doing so. Because of this she said this her account had exceeded her 
overdraft limit and fees and charges had been applied.
 
NatWest responded to Miss S complaint. They said theyd followed the correct process by 
refunding Miss S immediately when she raised her claims and later taking the amount back 
when provided with evidence from B. So they didnt uphold her complaint. Miss S wasnt 
happy with this response so referred her complaint to our service. 
After the complaint was referred here, NatWest offered £50 to resolve things. Our 
Investigator considered this offer and the circumstances of Miss S complaint. In summary, 
he said he thought NatWest had followed the correct process when dealing with her Direct 
Debit indemnity claim and because he didnt think theyd done anything wrong, the £50 was 
more than fair. 
Miss S didnt agree. She said she hadnt received the notification from B although she 
accepted it may have been sent to her and because of this, she didnt think it was fair for 
NatWest to have reversed her claim. 
As Miss S didnt agree, the complaints been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Direct Debit Guarantee is designed to protect customers from having payments wrongly 
taken from their accounts. If an error is made, customers are entitled to a full and immediate 
refund of the amount thats been debited from their bank or building society. But this doesnt 
affect the rights and obligations of the parties under the original contract.
 
Miss S made a Direct Debit indemnity claim with NatWest for the same payment B had taken 
from her account twice. The basis of Miss S claims was that B hadnt properly notified her of 
the change in the payment amount. On both occasions, NatWest refunded the amount 
immediately  as Id expect in line with the Direct Debit Guarantee process. Similarly, on 
both occasions the claims were rejected by B on the basis that B had notified Miss S of the 
amount due to be taken from her account by sending her a statement in May 2021 and so 
the amount was re-debited from Miss S account. B provided a copy of Miss S statement for 
her energy account to show this.
 
Miss S said NatWest didnt notify her that theyd be taking the refund back in June 2021. But 
Ive seen copies of the emails NatWest sent to Miss S. And, in her original submission 
Miss S provided a copy of one of those emails  dated 5 July 2021  to us. Both emails were 
sent to the same email address, so I dont know why she didnt receive the one sent in June 
2021. But Im satisfied NatWest correctly notified her that the indemnity claims had been 
unsuccessful and that the money would be taken out of her account. 
Miss S says she didnt receive the statement B says they sent her, there were problems with 
receiving post in her area at the time and so she doesnt think its fair NatWest have taken 
the refund back. I can understand why she wouldve found it worrying to have a large 
payment taken from her account with no apparent warning. But in the context of this 
complaint, Im only considering whether NatWest correctly followed the Direct Debit 
indemnity process and not the actions of B or any postal service. NatWest were obliged to 
follow the Direct Debit indemnity process  which as Ive explained above I think they did.  
While its unfortunate Miss S didnt receive the statement from B, I dont think this is 
something I can fairly say NatWest is responsible for.
NatWest have already offered to pay Miss S £50 to settle the complaint. Miss S should 
contact NatWest if she wishes to accept this offer. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont think NatWest needs to do anything to settle the 
complaint. 
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 April 2022.
