The complaint
Mr H complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) defaulted his account and 
reported this to the Credit Reference Agencies.
What happened
Mr H had an account with NatWest. In 2016, he left the UK and says he told NatWest this. 
He had an active complaint with NatWest at the time about charges applied to his account. 
He says that, in 2018, NatWest sent him an email saying that they would refund the charges, 
with the result that his account would be put into credit. 
In 2020, Mr H returned to the UK. He visited a NatWest branch and says he was told that his 
account had been left with a small overdrawn balance (of around £14 or £17) after the 
charges had been refunded and that his overdraft facility had been removed. He says the 
advisor explained that further charges had been applied since, increasing the overdrawn 
balance, and that NatWest had defaulted the account. Mr H says that the default was 
recorded on his credit file.
He says that the branch staff told him this was a mistake on NatWests part and that the 
balance would be cleared. He says they asked if he would like to keep the account open and 
told him he would receive a new card. He says he provided updated contact details. But Mr 
H says that, a few days later, he received a call from NatWests debt collection department 
seeking payment of the outstanding balance. He says that NatWest no longer accepted 
theyd made a mistake and were looking to recover the full outstanding balance from him.
Mr H complained to NatWest. They said they had applied the outstanding fees and charges 
to his account correctly and that the outstanding balance was due and payable. They 
couldnt find any record of having told Mr H that they would refund further charges, but they 
invited him to provide evidence of this. Mr H wasnt happy with NatWests response and 
came to this service. He said the outstanding debt and the impact on his credit file has been 
a huge strain on him. He would like NatWest to refund all charges to his account since it was 
opened and re-activate the account.
Our investigator explained that we cant consider Mr Hs complaints about the charges 
applied to his account, as NatWest had already issued final response letters about those 
complaints and Mr H hadnt referred them to us within the deadline for doing so. In relation to 
the current complaint, our investigator didnt think NatWest needed to do anything. But Mr H 
didnt agree and asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In response to a previous complaint by Mr H, NatWest refunded some fees in November 
2016 as a gesture of goodwill. This left an overdrawn balance of around £180. Mr H 
subsequently withdrew £120, taking the account further overdrawn. NatWest applied interest 
and charges in the period from November 2016 to June 2017. In April 2018, in response to a 
further complaint from Mr H, NatWest refunded further charges as a gesture of goodwill. This 
left the account overdrawn by around £370. A further charge was debited in June 2018 and 
there have been no further charges or interest applied since. The outstanding balance since 
June 2018 has been £437.24.
But Mr H says that, some time in 2018, he received an email from NatWest advising that 
charges were being refunded, with the effect that his account would be put into credit. He 
hasnt provided a copy of this email. And NatWest say they arent aware of any such email.
NatWests final response to the complaint of April 2018 was sent to Mr H by email. I note 
that the email address used was the same as Mr Hs current email address. In the absence 
of any evidence of other emails sent to Mr H in 2018 about charges being refunded, I think 
this may be the email Mr H is referring to. It does say that unarranged overdraft fees since 
November 2016 will be refunded. But it doesnt say this will put the account into credit. 
The email explained that a default notice had been issued in April 2017 and that Mr Hs 
account had been transferred to NatWests Recoveries Department. But NatWest 
acknowledged that Mr H had told them he wouldnt receive letters at his UK address, so they 
transferred his account back to their Collections Centre at this point and said they would 
remove the default reporting to the Credit Reference Agencies. But they said Mr H needed to 
contact the Collections Centre. They provided phone numbers for him to do this. The email 
went on to say that, if Mr H didnt contact the Collections Centre, a further default notice 
would be sent, a default would be reported to the Credit Reference Agencies and the 
account would be transferred to the Recoveries Department. I think it was clear from this that 
Mr H needed to take action if he wanted to avoid a default being recorded on his credit file.
Mr H says he was shocked to find that his account was overdrawn by £437.24 when he 
returned to the UK. I realise he feels strongly about this. But the email sent to him in April 
2018 pointed out that, even though NatWest had refunded charges, Mr H had made 
withdrawals from the account using online banking and hadnt made any payments into the 
account to cover interest or charges. This is confirmed by his statements. So I think Mr H 
ought reasonably to have been aware that his account was still overdrawn, despite the 
charges being refunded. 
Mr H says he was told in the branch that the overdrawn balance was a mistake and that it 
would be cleared. NatWest havent been able to provide any evidence of this discussion. But 
they maintain the outstanding balance is correct and that theyve done nothing wrong by 
defaulting the account and reporting this to the Credit Reference Agencies. I note that Mr Hs 
contact details were last updated by NatWest in August 2020. This ties in with what Mr H 
says about visiting the branch and providing his details. So Im satisfied that Mr H did visit 
the NatWest branch in August 2020. 
I find it likely that, when confirming his contact details, he had a conversation with a member 
of staff about his account. Mr H has provided an account of what was said. NatWest dont 
have any evidence of the conversation on their side. But theyve provided Mr Hs statement. 
This doesnt support what Mr H says the adviser told him about there being an overdrawn 
balance of around £14 or £17, to which charges were applied. The account was overdrawn 
by significantly more than that for the whole of the relevant period.
Im satisfied that the statements Ive seen correctly reflect the refunds made by NatWest. Im 
not looking here at whether those refunds were fair or whether any further charges should 
have been refunded, as those issues were addressed in Mr Hs previous complaints. For the 
purposes of this complaint, Im satisfied that the refunds were applied correctly to Mr Hs 
account and that there was an outstanding balance of £437.24 when he visited the branch in August 2020. I havent seen any evidence that this balance had been wrongly calculated. So 
I find that any information Mr H was given in the branch about it being a mistake was wrong.
As there had been an outstanding balance on the account for a long time and no payments 
into the account (other than NatWests refunds) since 2016, I dont think it was unreasonable 
for NatWest to default the account. And they have a duty to report correct information to the 
Credit Reference Agencies. So I dont think they acted unfairly by reporting the default.
I realise Mr H feels very strongly about his complaint and Im sorry to disappoint him. But I 
havent seen any evidence that NatWest did anything wrong here or acted unfairly. So Im 
not going to ask them to do anything.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 November 2021.
