Our adjudicator thought there were two chains  of lending here  the second  chain  starting with 
loan 17 because  although this was not the only gap in lending - there was a significant gap 
of 10 months after loan 16 was taken out. Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Ms complaint and 
thought all the loans from loans 1 to 20 shouldnt have been given. MYJAR disagreed with our 
adjudicators view but it made an offer to settle  the complaint in respect  of loans 4 to 10 only.  
Ms M rejected MYJARs offer and the case was passed to me to look at all the loans again. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Ref: DRN32417602MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Ms M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ms complaint.
MYJAR says that before it lent any of the loans, it asked Ms M about her monthly
income and normal  living costs. It also says it searched Ms Ms credit file. But as our 
adjudicator explained: 
a proportionate check for loans 1 to 7 would most likely have shown that the highest 
monthly repayment was a significant  proportion of Ms Ms declared  income  of £1,500.  
By loan 5, Ms M had taken out a new loan a short time after the previous loan  so I 
dont think she was using short term lending to deal with an unexpected cash flow. I 
think it was more  likely she was reliant  on short-term loans because she wasnt 
managing her money well.
Ref: DRN32417603I think there was a significant risk she wouldnt have been able to meet her existing 
commitments without  having to borrow again and with this background, she was unlikely 
to be able to sustain loan 1 onwards. 
So - and I agree with our adjudicator - I dont think MYJAR should have given loans 1 to 7 
to Ms M.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MYJARs  lending history of the first lending  chain 
with Ms M, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably 
have seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.  And so MYJAR 
should have realised that it shouldnt have provided  any further loans.  
I have considered everything  MYJAR had said but given the particular circumstances  of Ms Ms 
case, I think that this point  was reached by loan 8. I say this because:
At this point MYJAR ought  to have realised Ms M was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably.  Ms M had taken  out 7 loans  within  4 months  and Ms M had been 
indebted to MYJAR for around 4 months.  So MYJAR ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Ms M was having to borrow further  to cover  the hole repaying  her 
previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Ms Ms indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Ms Ms first loan was for £500  and loan 8 was for the same amount. At this point 
MYJAR ought  to have  known that Ms M was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  
shortfall in her income but to meet  an ongoing  need. 
From loan 8 to loan 16, Ms M was provided  with a new loan within  days/weeks  of 
settling a previous one. 
Ms M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed MYJAR. Loan 16 was 
taken out over a year after Ms Ms first. And it was for a larger amount. Ms M had paid 
large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to MYJAR over an extended period.
I think that Ms M lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loans 8 to 
16 because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Ms Ms indebtedness  by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans  and the length of time over which Ms M borrowed was likely to have 
had negative  implications on Ms Ms ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept her 
in the market for these high-cost loans.
I then looked at the second chain of lending  to Ms M starting with loan 17. This was the first 
instalment loan Ms M took out with MYJAR  in this lending relationship.  I have considered 
everything MYJAR has said, but I think a more proportionate check  for loan 17 onwards 
would most  likely have  shown that the highest monthly  repayment  was a significant  
proportion of Ms Ms declared  income  of £1,700.  So again, I think there  was a significant risk 
she wouldnt  have been able to meet her existing commitments without having to borrow 
again and with this background, she was unlikely  to be able to sustain loan 17 onwards.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 1 to 20 (inclusive)  and MYJAR  should put 
things right.
Ref: DRN32417604putting things right  what MYJAR Limited needs to do
MYJAR Limited shouldnt  have given Ms M loans 1 to 20 (inclusive).
If MYJAR  Limited has sold the outstanding  debts,  it should buy these back if it is able to do 
so and then take the following steps.  If MYJAR  Limited is not able to buy the debts  back then 
it should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve  the results  outlined below.
A)Add together the total of the repayments  made  by Ms M towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans  without an outstanding balance,  not including anything  
MYJAR Limited has already refunded.
B)Calculate 8% per year simple interest* on the individual  payments made  by Ms M which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms M originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C)Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding  
loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Ms M as though they had been  repayments of 
the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Ms M having made overpayments 
then MYJAR Limited  should  refund these overpayments with 8% per year simple 
interest* calculated on the overpayments,  from the date the overpayments  would have 
arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. MYJAR Limited should  then refund  the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step E.
D)If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should  be 
used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans and any principal MYJAR Limited 
has already written-off. If this results in a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Ms M. 
However if there  is still an outstanding balance then MYJAR  Limited  should  try to agree an 
affordable repayment plan with Ms M. MYJAR  Limited  shouldnt pursue outstanding balances  
made up of the principal which  MYJAR  Limited has already written-off.
E)You should remove any adverse payment  information recorded on Ms Ms credit  file in 
relation to 1 to 7 and 17 to 20 (inclusive). The overall  pattern of Ms Ms borrowing for 
loans 8 to 16 (inclusive) means any information  recorded about  them  is adverse, so 
MYJAR Limited should remove  these loans entirely from Ms Ms credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR Limited  to deduct tax from this interest. 
MYJAR Limited should give Ms M a certificate  showing  how much tax it has deducted, 
if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Ms Ms complaint.  MYJAR  Limited  should  put 
things right for Ms M as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 April 2020.
