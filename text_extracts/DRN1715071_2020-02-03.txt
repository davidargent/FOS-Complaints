K820x#14Complaint
Mr T is complaining that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has used the 
compensation it offered  for the mis-selling of a payment protection insurance (PPI)  
policy attached to his credit  card,  to reduce his outstanding debt.
Background
In 2018, Mr T complained  to NatWest about  a PPI policy sold alongside a credit card.  
NatWest upheld the complaint and offered compensation of just under £2,000. 
Mr T accepted the offer as a full and final settlement to his complaint. He signed and 
returned the acceptance form in November 2018.  On the acceptance form that Mr T signed,  
it stated that the compensation  offer would take into account any arrears Mr T had on his 
credit card. Mr T amended the form crossing  out this part and added a note to say this 
wasnt applicable  as his account  had closed in 2007.
After receiving the form, as Mr T had an outstanding  balance  of around £9,000 that hadnt 
been repaid, NatWest  used the PPI compensation amount to reduce what  Mr T owed. 
Mr T felt this was unfair. Mr T considered  that that there had been  no activity in regards to 
the outstanding debt for over 10 years. So Mr T considered the debt was statue barred 
under The Limitation Act 1980 and the compensation should be paid to him directly.
Unhappy, Mr T referred the matter  to our service.
NatWest in its submissions to this service  explained  that as Mr T had amended  the 
settlement form, it became invalid. It explained that it shouldnt have made the payment and 
it is happy to reverse  the payment should Mr T agree. But importantly, if Mr T accepts  the 
compensation it will still go to reducing what is owed and wont be paid directly to Mr T.
NatWest also explained that in reviewing  Mr Ts complaint it could have handled it better  
than it did  and it offered  £75 compensation for its poor customer  service. It explained it 
would pay this directly  to Mr T via cheque  if he accepts.
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mr Ts complaint and thought NatWest had acted fairly. 
As Mr T disagreed, and as the matter hasnt been  resolved, its been passed to me for a final 
decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I note that initially  NatWest objected to our service looking at the complaint as it considered  
Mr T had signed in full and final settlement of his complaint.  Im glad to see that this issue  
has been resolved  and NatWest has withdrawn any objection.  
NatWest has agreed it mis-sold  the PPI policy to Mr T, so I dont need to look at how it was 
sold. And Mr T hasnt complained about  the amount NatWest  has offered in 
compensation, so I havent looked at this.
Ref: DRN17150712In this decision, Ive only looked at whether it was fair for NatWest  to use the 
compensation its offered to reduce his outstanding debt.
Having done so, I think NatWest has acted fairly. I know  this will come as a 
disappointment to Mr T, so I would like to take this opportunity  to explain why.
Mr Ts says the debt he held with NatWest is statue barred under The Limitation Act 1980, 
and so the compensation should be paid to him directly.  
The Limitation Act 1980 sets out the timescales  with which a lender can legally pursue a 
debt. So while NatWest  may no longer be able to legally pursue Mr T for the debt he owes  it 
 the debt Mr T has with NatWest hasnt ceased to exist.  
NatWest has provided evidence to show that Mr Ts credit card had an outstanding balance 
of around £9,000. 
NatWest is still out of pocket for this money.  And it isnt pursuing Mr T for the debt. It has 
accepted it owes  Mr T money  for the PPI compensation,  so it owes  him a debt. And it is 
setting off this debt for the PPI compensation  against the debt Mr T owed for his spending 
on the credit  card account which still exists and hasnt been fully repaid.
There is in law what is called the equitable right of set-off which allows  people  to set-off  
closely connected debts.  This means that one person (A) can deduct from a debt they owe 
another person (B), money which that person (B) owes  to them. 
For this right of set-off to apply, I must be satisfied that there is a close connection  between  
the PPI compensation and the outstanding  debt.  I must also consider whether  it would  be 
fair for NatWest to set-off in this way. Both tests must be satisfied for me to find that NatWest  
has an equitable right to set-off the PPI compensation against Mr Ts outstanding debt on his 
credit card account. 
The PPI sold to Mr T was directly connected  to his credit card account. Using the right of set-
off I have outlined  above, I am satisfied the PPI compensation and the credit card debt are 
closely connected. They are both related to the same  account Mr T had with NatWest.
As both parties owe each  other money  relating to the same account, it seems  fair that one 
amount should  be set off against the other.  I havent  been provided with any further 
information which suggests this isnt fair.
Overall, NatWest has reduced what Mr T owes it and I think  it was fair for NatWest to do so. 
NatWest has said because Mr T amended  the acceptance form, it should  have  been  treated 
as invalid. It says it can reverse the payment if Mr T wishes.  But it wont pay Mr T the 
compensation while his account still has an outstanding balance.  Given what  Ive said 
above, that seems  fair. I dont think it would be fair for Mr T to receive the compensation 
directly when there is an outstanding balance owed to NatWest.  However  the option is open  
to Mr T. If he wishes NatWest to reverse the payment, it is willing  to do so. It is for Mr T to 
contact NatWest if he wants  that to happen.
Ref: DRN17150713NatWest has also said it should have provided  Mr T with a response  to his correspondence  
disputing the way the redress had been paid. As it didnt, it offered £75 to recognise the poor 
customer service  Mr T received. I see NatWest  is willing to pay this directly to Mr T via 
cheque. That seems fair. If Mr T wishes to accept this amount he should contact NatWest 
directly.
My final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont  uphold Mr Ts complaint. I think it was fair for 
National Westminster Bank Plc to use the credit card PPI compensation  it owed Mr T to 
reduce his outstanding debt credit card balance that hasnt been repaid  in full.
National Westminster Bank Plcs  offer of £75 as additional compensation is also fair. Mr T 
should contact  National Westminster Bank  Plc if he wishes to accept this.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman  Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 March  2020.
