The complaint
Mr M acquired online goods using his National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) credit card 
which, when delivered, he considered to be faulty. He says that he phoned NatWest in mid-
March 2022 to raise a dispute over this transaction, but he received a very unsatisfactory 
response. He then complained to NatWest about the poor quality of service that it had 
provided to him. 
What happened
This complaint is about the level of service provided by NatWest to Mr M, and not about the 
quality of the goods he acquired. It is also not related to another matter involving NatWest 
and Mr M, about which he has recently complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service. 
Mr M said:
The NatWest representative with whom he spoke was rude and gave him incorrect 
information  and, when he challenged what he was told, the representative abruptly 
ended the call
When he complained, NatWest told him that it could not locate the recording of this 
call
NatWest added that, because it was unable to clarify what was said during the call, it 
was unable to uphold his complaint
He responded by giving NatWest details of when he had called it
But NatWest was unable to locate the relevant call, and so it continued to be unable 
to uphold his complaint  
Mr M then referred his complaint to us. 
In May 2022, NatWest told us that it had managed to locate recordings of two calls made by 
Mr M, on the day in March 2022 that he complained to it about the quality of service it had 
provided. NatWest said that the calls did not align with what Mr M claimed had happened. It 
provided copies of the recordings to us.  
Our investigator did not think the complaint should be upheld. He acknowledged that the 
recordings provided by NatWest might not have included the call to which Mr M referred in 
his complaint.  
But our investigator did not consider that these located recordings demonstrated poor 
service quality. And, in the absence of any other recordings which might do so, he could not 
reasonably say that NatWest had done something wrong. 
Mr M disagreed with our investigator, and so this complaint was referred for review by an 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where evidence is incomplete, inconsistent or contradictory (as some of it is here), I reach 
my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider most likely to 
have happened in light of the available evidence and wider circumstances. 
I have listened to two calls which I understand were made on the day that Mr M complained 
to Nat West. And I agree with NatWest and our investigator that these calls do not represent 
the poor service quality about which Mr M complains. But I think it is regrettable that 
NatWest was unable to find these recordings until after Mr M had referred his complaint to 
us.
I accept it is possible that another call was made, in which Mr M received an unsatisfactory 
response from the NatWest representative. But I think it is more likely that there was no such 
call. And so, on the balance of probabilities, I find that I have come to the same conclusion 
as our investigator, for similar reasons.
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 September 2022.
