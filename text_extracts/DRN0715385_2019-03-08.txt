K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains that Red Sands Insurance Company (Europe) Limited paid only part of his 
claim under his pet insurance policy. 
This complaint concerns  the dog belonging to Mr W and his wife Mrs W, and the complaint 
has been brought to us in Mr and Mrs Ws joint names. I appreciate Mrs W has handled  
some of the policy administration and complaint. But the policy  is in Mr Ws sole name. So 
for this reason  Ive referred  to it as Mr Ws complaint. 
My references to Red Sands include its agents.  
background
Mr Ws original  lifetime pet insurance  policy with Red Sands allowed him to claim up to 
£2,000 a year for each condition suffered by his dog. In 2016 he made  a claim for a lower  
back problem suffered by his dog. He later decided  to upgrade  the policy  with Red Sands to 
one which  had a £4,000  annual condition limit. 
In 2018 Mr W contacted Red Sands to pre-authorise some treatment for his dog. He later put 
in a claim for the cost of the vets treatment, being  just under £6,000, expecting to receive a 
payment of £4,000. Red Sands paid just over £2,000, the policy  limit in 2016,  because it said 
the illness was related  to one suffered by the dog in 2016. This meant it was pre-existing 
under the upgraded  policy so the lower condition  limit for the previous policy applied instead. 
Our investigator thought the fair outcome was for Red Sands to pay the claim up to the 
£4,000 limit, with interest. She explained Mr Ws specialist vet thought  the 2016 illness was 
unrelated to the 2018 one. Red Sands didnt agree, and provided  its own consultant vets 
opinion. So the complaints come to me for review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive decided to uphold  it. 
Ill explain  why.
The key issue in this case is whether  the illness suffered by the dog in 2018  is the same  as 
the one that he had in 2016. If it was the same, then Red Sands can fairly apply the 2016 
policy limit of £2,000  to the claim.
Its not in dispute  that in 2016  the dog had problems affecting his legs at the lower  (lumbar) 
spine and in 2018 he had problems affecting his gait at the neck (cervical  spine).  This is 
shown in the clinical notes made by the treating  vet. But Red Sands says that the problems 
were caused  by the same underlying condition. It says the lower back disc problems in 2016 
went beyond the discs treated by the vet at that time. 
The evidence given  by Red Sands consultant vet, based on the clinical  notes, is that the 
dogs breed has a higher than average risk of spinal disease. The discs typically dehydrate,  
degenerate and then rupture. And the vet says that although different discs were affected  in 
2016 and 2018, both extrusions were  a type typical for degeneration  associated with the 
breed. The vet distinguished this type of rupture from a traumatic rupture of an otherwise 
healthy disc. The vet referred  to the chance  of recurrence in this breed, and said that this 
Ref: DRN07153852together with the type of rupture means that the 2016 and 2018 issues are related. The vet 
accepted that in 2016 the treating vet didnt comment on the dogs cervical (neck) vertebrae  
 that is, the vertebrae affected  in 2018  and assumed that this area wasnt x-rayed.
The vet who treated Mr Ws dog in 2018  has written  to support  the claim. The vet, who is a 
specialist in neurology, said the dog had been referred to him for neck pain and deterioration 
in his gait. The vet said that the dog was examined and after investigation was found  to have 
a cervical spinal  cord compression due to intervertebral disc herniation  at the area of the 
cervical (neck) spine called C4-C5. The spinal cord was successfully decompressed and the 
dog recovered  well. The specialist  vet also said the intervertebral disc herniation  affecting 
the neck was unrelated  to the previous herniation in July 2016 which affected the dogs  
lumbar (lower back) spine at the area called L3-L4. 
Ive carefully weighed up all the evidence. Having  done so I find I prefer  the evidence of the 
specialist vet. I say this because that vet examined  and treated the dog, and had access to 
his clinical history. The vet is a specialist  in his field. And having examined the dog, the 
specialist vet said the 2018 problem  was unrelated to the previous problem in 2016.
I appreciate the point  made by Red Sands consultant vet that Mr Ws dog belongs to a 
breed which has a higher than average  risk of spinal disease, and that the type of hernia  is 
due to disc degeneration. But I dont think this increased risk factor shows, of itself, that 
Mr Ws dogs 2016 and 2018 problems were related. And the specialist vet who has seen  
and treated the dog specifically says they are not related. 
It follows that I dont think its fair for Red Sands to apply the lower £2,000 limit to the 2018  
claim. I think  the fair outcome is for it to apply a limit of £4,000.  The overall claim was for 
much more than £4,000.  So even  allowing for the policy excess  and 20% co-payment  its 
correct for Red Sands  to pay the balance of the claim  to the policy limit of £4,000. Its paid 
Mr W an amount  of £2,062.33 already. So it must pay Mr W the balance of £1,937.67  
together with simple  interest of 8% per year from the date that he paid the vet to the date 
Red Sands  makes the payment  to him. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given I uphold this complaint. Within 28 days  of the date we send it 
Mr Ws acceptance of this final decision I order Red Sands  Insurance Company (Europe) 
Limited to pay him the amount of £1,937.67. It must add simple interest* at the rate of 8% 
per year from the date that he paid the vets bill until the date Red Sands makes  the 
payment to him. 
Ref: DRN07153853Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 April 2019.

*If Red Sands Insurance Company (Europe)  Limited considers that its required by 
HM Revenue & Customs  to take off income tax from that interest, it should tell Mr W how 
much its taken off. It should also give Mr W a certificate showing this if he asks for one, so 
he can reclaim  the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
