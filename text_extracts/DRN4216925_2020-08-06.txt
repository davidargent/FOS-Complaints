K820x#14Complaint
Ms O complains that NewDay Ltd (trading as Aquacard) reported the wrong date of birth to 
the credit  reference  agencies  and went on to block a Notice of Correction she tried to 
register. 
Background
Ms O completed a credit card application in January  2014.  Ms Os date of birth was given in 
her application  form.  
Ms O says she returned the credit card a short  time after it was received as she decided  it 
wasnt right for her. Ms O also says shes not responsible for any transactions that were 
carried out after she returned her credit  card.  
Ms O has made various complaints to NewDay over the years.  In May 2019 Ms O referred 
her complaints to us and her case was passed  to an adjudicator. The adjudicator  said most 
of the issues raised hadnt been referred  to us in time which  meant we couldnt  consider 
them. On 19 December 2019 an ombudsman looked at Ms Os case and agreed  that our 
service couldnt look at the majority  of the issues she had raised because  they hadnt  been 
referred to us within the time limits  given in our rules. The ombudsman  said our service  
could look at Ms Os complaints about her date of birth. 
The adjudicator went on to give their view on whether sNewDay had made  a mistake when it 
reported Ms Os date of birth. But the adjudicator  said the date of birth matched the one 
given in Ms Os original application and didnt find NewDay had made a mistake. The 
adjudicator also said NewDay couldnt  block a Notice of Correction from being added  to 
Ms Os credit  file. Ms O remains unhappy  that this service isnt able to look at the main  
points shes raised. Ms O asked for her complaint to be appealed so its been passed to me 
to make a decision. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know Ms O remains unhappy that we are only able to look at certain  parts of her complaint. 
But another ombudsman has already made a decision concerning whether we can consider 
all of Ms Os complaint. The decision was sent on 19 December 2019 and explains why we 
can only look at Ms Os concerns relating to her date of birth.  In this decision, Im only going 
to talk about Ms Os complaints relating to her date of birth and attempt to register a Notice 
of Correction. 
Ms O completed and signed an application  form on 17 January 2014. The application gave 
information about Ms Os personal and financial circumstances,  including her address, 
income and date of birth.  The application form is handwritten and, as Ive said,  Ms O signed  
it. The application Ms O completed gives her date of birth as 13 April 1952, which is the date 
NewDay reported to the credit  reference  agencies. 
I know Ms O has told us the date of birth is wrong.  But Im satisfied NewDay has reported 
her date of birth in line with the information Ms O provided in the application form. I havent 
found any evidence  that NewDay made a mistake. In its file submission to this service,  
Ref: DRN42169252NewDay said it can update Ms Os information  (including how it reports  her date of birth) if 
she provides some  up to date identification,  like a passport or drivers licence. I leave it to Ms 
O to get in contact  with NewDay to provide the necessary identification  so it can update her 
date of birth. 
Ms O also complains  that NewDay has blocked a Notice of Correction shes tried to add. But 
NewDay has confirmed in its final response dated  16 May 2019 that it cant  block a Notice of 
Correction. I havent  seen evidence that shows NewDay tried to stop Ms O registering  a 
Notice of Correction. 
Im sorry  to disappoint Ms O but Im satisfied  her date of birth is recorded in line with the 
information NewDay obtained in her credit  card application. NewDay says it can amend 
Ms Os date of birth if she provides acceptable identification.  I havent found that NewDay 
has blocked a Notice of Correction Ms O tried to register. As I havent found  anything to 
show NewDay has made a mistake or treated Ms O unfairly, Im not telling it to take any 
further action. 
My final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 September  2020.
