The complaint
Mr W complains about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA and their decision to approve his 
application for a credit account. 
What happened
In January 2019, Mr W applied for a credit account with PayPal. This application was 
approved, and he was provided with a credit limit of £1,750.
But by November 2020, Mr W was in arrears on his account. PayPal sent him a notice of 
default, explaining he needed to clear the arrears to avoid a default being placed on his 
account. But Mr W has explained he didnt have the financial means to do so. And he was 
also unable to agree a repayment plan. So, he raised a complaint.
Mr W said at the time he applied for the PayPal credit account, he was already in financial 
difficulty. He felt the account was unaffordable and that PayPal should never have approved 
it. So, he wanted his outstanding debit to be written offer.
PayPal didnt respond. But after contact from our service, they explained they assessed Mr 
Ws application against their usual lending criteria. This was assessing Mr Ws use of his 
regular PayPal account and completing a credit check. They said they completed these 
steps, and Mr W was deemed eligible for credit. So, they didnt think theyd done anything 
wrong. Mr W remained unhappy with this response, so he asked us to continue with his 
complaint.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and upheld it. She recognised Mr W had provided 
the incorrect income information on the application. But she didnt think PayPal had 
completed proportionate checks when approving the application. She recognised PayPal 
were unable to provide the credit report they used, and as Mr W had made complaints about 
other lenders, his up to date credit report didnt reflect was PayPal wouldve seen at the time. 
But she explained shed seen evidence to show Mr W had an outstanding credit card 
account that had exceeded its limit, two outstanding loans, and that hed made 24 
applications for pay day lending in the months leading up to his credit application. 
She thought if PayPal had made proportionate checks, they wouldve identified the difficulty 
Mr W found himself in at the time. And she dont think they wouldve approved the 
application. So, she recommended that PayPal remove all interest and charges that were 
applied from the start of the account and then restructure the account to include the 
payments Mr W had already made. If this led to Mr W requiring a refund, she recommended 
PayPal pay this with 8% interest from when Mr Ws payments wouldve cleared the balance 
and to close the account. But if a balance was left outstanding, she recommended PayPal 
freeze any interest and charges and arrange a suitable payment plan with Mr W. Finally, she 
recommended that PayPal remove any negative information recorded on Mr Ws credit file.
Mr W agreed. But PayPal didnt.  They thought theyd acted within the terms of their user 
agreement by relying on the information Mr W provided at the time of the application, and 
the credit report they wouldve completed. Theyve explained they dont keep a record of the 
report they used but they confirmed if there was negative information that wouldve 
prevented them from offering the credit, this wouldve resulted in a decline of the application. 
As the application was approved, they dont think the credit check they did provided 
information to show the credit wasnt affordable. So, they didnt think theyd done anything 
wrong. As PayPal didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise this impact has had on Mr W. Ive no doubt Mr W has found himself 
in a difficult financial situation. And I can understand the upset and worry he wouldve felt 
because of this. I can also understand why, with hindsight, Mr W has looked back at the 
credit he was provided during this time and holds the lenders providing this credit 
accountable for the situation he finds himself in.
So, Ive considered whether I think PayPal acted responsibly when approving his credit 
application. And to do this, Ive had to think about whether the checks they made were 
proportionate, providing them with enough information to suggest the credit was affordable. 
And if so, Ive then considered whether I think PayPal assess this information fairly. And 
having done so, I dont think they did in this instance. 
Ive seen the initial application Mr W submitted to PayPal. Within this, he stated his monthly 
income to be over £2,000. And that he lived with parents at the time of the application. But I 
can see that no further financial information was provided. I think it was reasonable for 
PayPal to assume the information Mr W provided was correct, even though Ive seen his 
actual monthly income was much less.
PayPal say they used this information, the way Mr W used his PayPal account, and a credit 
check to determine whether he was eligible for credit. But I dont think this information was 
proportionate to the credit limit they provided Mr W. Although I can appreciate PayPal would 
consider the way Mr W managed his account, I dont think this is representative of his actual 
financial situation. Had this been a current account, where Mr Ws earning were paid into 
and where his regular outgoings were shown, I might have been more inclined to agree. But 
in this case, Mr W was using his PayPal account to make purchases and potentially sell 
items and services. His use of this account didnt show his regular income, his regular 
outgoings and in particular, any payments to other credit he may have outstanding. And Ive 
seen from Mr Ws bank statements as this time that he was regularly into his overdraft and 
making numerous payments to pay day lenders. I think, as Mr W didnt provide his living 
expenses or his employment status in his application, PayPal shouldve made further checks 
before deciding the application should be approved, and a limit of over £1,700 be applied.
And even if I did decide the checks PayPal made were proportionate, I dont think they 
assessed the information they did have access to fairly.
PayPal say the credit report didnt provide information to suggest the application shouldnt be 
approved. In particular, PayPal say they usually use a customers credit score as the rating 
they refer to. Unfortunately, PayPal have been unable to provide me with a copy of the credit 
report they used. And, as Mr W has had his credit report amended since January 2019, his current report doesnt reflect what PayPal wouldve seen. 
As Im unable to see the credit report PayPal used, Ive looked at further information to show 
the outstanding credit Mr W had at the time. Ive seen Mr W had a credit card with another 
lender, where hed exceeded his credit limit on five occasions in the previous 12 months. He 
also had two outstanding personal loans, one of which was in arrears. And Ive also seen 
that Mr W took several pay day loans in the time leading up to his application with PayPal. I 
think this information is enough to suggest that Mr W was struggling financially. And, without 
evidence provided by PayPal to show otherwise, I think its reasonable to assume this 
information wouldve been present on Mr Ws credit file. So, while I understand PayPals 
affordability calculations revolve around a credit score, I think the information that I assume 
wouldve been present in the report shouldve shown to PayPal that Mr W was struggling 
financially, and that the credit was unaffordable. 
So, I dont think the checks PayPal completed on this occasion were proportionate to the 
credit Mr W was given. And I dont think PayPal assessed the information they were likely to 
have available fairly. Because of this, I dont think PayPal acted fairly when approving Mr W 
for credit, and I think this has impacted Mr W negatively as it placed him further into financial 
difficulty. So, Ive then thought about what I think PayPal should do to rectify this.
Putting things right
I think if PayPal had completed proportionate checks, they wouldve realised that Mr W was 
struggling financially. And I think they should also have realised this from the information 
likely to have been contained in his credit file. And I think if they had of acted fairly and 
reasonably, they wouldve declined Mr Ws application.
Had they declined Mr Ws application, Mr W wouldnt have incurred the additional interest, 
fees and charges currently on his credit account with PayPal. So, I think these should be 
removed from the account. But I do think Mr W has had the ability to use the account and 
the funds available. So, I think he still has a responsibility to pay for the purchases he made.
Im aware Mr W had made payments to the account since it was opened. So, I think these 
payments should be deducted from the outstanding balance once it has been restructured 
without the interest, fees and charges. If this leaves an amount that should be refunded to 
Mr W, I think this should be paid plus 8% interest from the date Mr Ws payments wouldve 
cleared the balance. HM Revenue & Customs requires PayPal to take off tax from this 
interest. PayPal must give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax theyve taken off if he 
asks for one. And I think the account should then be closed.
If the account remains with an outstanding balance Mr W still needs to pay, I think the 
interest, fees and charges should be frozen and a suitable repayment plan organised with Mr 
W. I say this as PayPal have a responsibility to act positively and sympathetically to Mr W 
and I think its clear he is in a difficulty financial situation.
And finally, I think PayPal should removed any negative information reported on Mr Ws 
credit file. This is because I dont think PayPal shouldve provided Mr W with credit in the first 
place. So, I dont think its fair for Mr Ws credit file to be negatively impacted from a mistake 
PayPal made. When we look to put things right for a customer, we look to place them back 
in the position they wouldve been in if an error hadnt occurred. And in this case, Mr W 
wouldnt have received credit from PayPal, so his credit file wouldnt have been affected.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I uphold Mr Ws complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA and I direct them to take the following action:
Restructure Mr Ws account to remove all interest, fees and charges from the date 
the account was set up.
If the payments Mr W made settle the account and leave an outstanding balance, 
PayPal should refund this amount to Mr W plus 8% interest from the date the 
payments wouldve settled the outstanding balance. PayPal should then close the 
account.
If a balance if left outstanding, PayPal should freeze any further interest, fees and 
charges and arrange a suitable repayment plan with Mr W.
Remove any negative information from Mr Ws credit file for the account.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 March 2021.
