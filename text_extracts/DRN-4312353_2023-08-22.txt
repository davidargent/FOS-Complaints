The complaint
Mrs F complains about the management and administration by BMW Financial Services(GB)
Limited (BMWFS) of her hire purchase agreement (agreement).
Mrs F is represented in her complaint by a third party. But for ease of reading, Ill refer to any
submissions and comments made by Mrs Fs representative as if they had been made by
Mrs F herself.
What happened
On 8 February 2022 Mrs F entered into an agreement with BMWFS for a new car costing
£31,000. Under the terms of this agreement, everything else being equal, Mrs F undertook to
make 47 monthly payments of £464.52 followed by 1 monthly payment of £13,477.71 
making a total repayable of £35,310.15 at an APR of 4.9%.
On 11 March 2022 Mrs F emailed BMWFS to say that she understood her payments would
fall due on 21 of each month.
On 12 March 2022 BMWFS emailed Mrs F to say her payments fall due on 8 of each month.
On 18 May 2022 Mrs F requested for her payment due date be moved to the last day of the
month. This was actioned by BMWFS with the next payment due date amended to fall on
31 May 2022.
On 29 August 2022 Mrs F emailed BMWFS to ask for her payment due date to be moved to
28 of each month. This was actioned by BMWFS with all further payments being amended
to fall due on 28 of the month starting 28 September 2022.
On 13 February 2023 Mrs F called BMWFS to say that she was never advised that two
payments would fall due in May 2022 following her request for her payment due date to be
moved to the last day of the month.
On 22 March 2023 BMWFS issued Mrs F with a final response letter (FRL). Under cover of
this FRL BMWFS said that it can only move a payment date by a maximum 15 days.
Therefore, it wasnt possible to move the Mrs Fs payment due date to 30 June 2022 and
thats why it was moved to 31 May 2023.
However, BMWFS accepted this fact should have been made clear to Mrs F before she
committed to the move and for that it said it was prepared to pay her £50.
On 17 April 2023, and unhappy with BMWFS FRL, Mrs F referred her complaint to our
service.
Mrs Fs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that
having offered to pay Mrs F £50 BMWFS need do nothing further.
Mrs F didnt agree and so her complaint was passed to me for review and decision.
In August 2023 I issued a provisional decision in which I said, in summary:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear that Mrs F has very strong feelings about this complaint. She has provided detailed
submissions in support of her view which I can confirm Ive read and considered in their
entirety. However, I trust that Mrs F will not take the fact that my findings focus on what I
consider to be the central issues, and that they are expressed in considerably less detail, as
a discourtesy. The purpose of my decision isnt to address every point raised. The purpose
of my decision is to set out my conclusions and reasons for reaching them.
I would also point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear, or
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
payment date set for 8 of each month from March 2022
Mrs F says that she asked the supplying dealership, in its capacity as the broker of her
agreement, for her monthly payments to be set to fall due on the last day of each month
(commencing 31 March 2022) and it advised her this could be accommodated.
Now I accept I cant say for certain what Mrs F asked the supplying dealership in this
respect, or what it said could or couldnt be accommodated. But the agreement that Mrs F
signed clearly states that payments would fall due on the 8 of the month commencing
8 March 2022. Therefore, Im not persuaded, on the balance of probabilities, that Mrs F was
misled in this respect as she submits.
payment date move request made by Mrs F on 18 May 2022 to the last day of the month by
telephone
Mrs F says that she made this request by telephone and wasnt advised in the call that her
next payment would be amended to fall due on 31 May 2022 rather than 30 June 2022.
I appreciate what Mrs F says on this point. But having considered what both parties have
said and submitted Im satisfied that this request was made by Mrs F online and not by
phone meaning there is no call recording for our service to request and to listen to.
payment date move request made by Mrs F on 18 May 2022 to the last day of the month
online
Mrs F says that she understood that having requested a payment move date to the last day
of the month that her next payment would be amended to fall due on 30 June 2022, not
31 May 2022. And had she been advised that her next payment due date would be amended 
to fall due on 31 May 2022 (and not 30 June 2022) she wouldnt have gone ahead with the 
move.
I find Mrs Fs submission in this respect to be both plausible and persuasive. Its also not in
dispute that BMWFS accepts that it didnt advise Mrs F that her next payment date would be
amended to fall due on 31 May 2022 rather than 30 June 2022.
So, Im satisfied that Mrs F should be compensated for this. Now BMWFS has offered Mrs F
£50 for this, but Im not persuaded this is sufficient.In my view had BMWFS advised Mrs F that her next payment due date would be amended
to fall due on 31 May 2022 (rather than 30 June 2022) she wouldnt have gone ahead with
the move. So, in my view it follows that its only fair that BMWFS should amend its records to
show Mrs Fs monthly payments all falling due on 8 of each month with only one payment
falling due each month with an appropriate adjustment being made to the recorded arrears
position. Furthermore, I think that its only fair that this amended arrears position is shared
with all credit reference agencies BMWF reports to.
payment date move request made by Mrs F on 29 August 2022 to 28 of each month by
email
Im satisfied that this request was made by Mrs F on the understanding that her payments
had been amended to fall due on the last day of each month starting 30 June 2022 (not
31 May 2022). Therefore, I think its fair that this request be disregarded with all payments
remaining due on 8 of each month.
Both parties responded to my provisional findings to say they accepted them.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both parties accepted my provisional findings I see no reason to depart from them and I 
now confirm them as final.
My final decision
My final decision is I uphold this complaint and BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited must:
pay Mrs F £50 as offered under its FRL dated 22 March 2023
amend its records to show Mrs Fs monthly payments all falling due on 8 of each
month with only one payment falling due each month with an appropriate adjustment
made to the recorded arrears position
share with all credit reference agencies it reports to the amended arrears position
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 September 2023.
