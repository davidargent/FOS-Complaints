K821x#15complaint
Mr W says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny, irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 27 loans Sunny provided to Mr W between December 2015 and 
August 2017.  Ive added  a table at the end of my decision  setting  out some  of the details  of 
Mr Ws loans.  
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ws complaint about loans 6 onwards and thought that these 
loans shouldnt have  been given. Sunny disagreed with the view but offered to uphold  
Mr Ws complaint  about loans 14 onwards. Mr W didnt agree to the offer, so the complaint 
was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN67488212Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Ws complaint about loans 1  5, and Mr W seems to have 
accepted this. So as these loans  are no longer in dispute, I havent  considered them further.  
But I have looked  at all my Mr Ws loans  when thinking about  his lending history  with Sunny. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  Our adjudicator  felt that this point had been 
reached by loan 6. However, given the fact that these loans were all taken  out within the
space of five months, I dont think it had yet reached the point  considering how long these
loans were meant to run for - to suggest that a pattern  of lending had developed.
Based on the evidence  Ive seen I think this point was reached by loan 10. I say this because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have realised Mr W was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr W had taken out nine loans within nine months, and the amounts 
borrowed were  not significantly reducing. So, at the point of applying  for loan 10 Sunny 
ought to have known that Mr W was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall  in 
their income but to meet  an ongoing  need.  
Mr W did pay off most of his loans early,  and in the beginning of the lending  relationship  
Mr W paid off his first three loans within one month and didnt borrow  again till a few 
months later. But from loan 4 onwards Mr W began to borrow loans in quick  succession  
and took out further borrowing quickly after repaying earlier loans.
For example, Mr W repaid loan 4 on the same  day he took out loan 7, borrowing more 
than three  times the amount of loan 4. And he repaid  loan 6 on the same day he took 
out loan 8. Mr W took out loans 7 and 8 within  two days  of each other with a total 
borrowing amount  of £700. So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more likely  than not 
Mr W was having to borrow further  to cover  the hole repaying his previous  loan was 
leaving in his finances and that Mr Ws indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Looking  at the entire  lending chain between December 2015  and August 2017,  Ive seen 
that there are times when  Mr W was not indebted  to Sunny.  However, across the one 
year and eight-month  period, Mr W was never debt free from Sunny  for more than two 
months. From loan 10 onwards Mr W often took out a new loan the same day or shortly 
after paying off a previous loan. And even though Mr W paid off most of his loans early 
he had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
Ref: DRN67488213I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 10 
onwards because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans  and the length of time over which Mr W borrowed was likely to have 
had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans.
So, Im upholding  Mr Ws complaint from loan 10 onwards. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
If Sunny has sold the outstanding debts, it should buy these back if its able to do so and
then take the following steps. If Sunny is not able to buy the debts back, then it should liaise
with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A.Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Mr W towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything  Sunny has already refunded.
B.Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual payments made by Mr W. 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr W originally made  
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C.Sunny  should  remove all interest,  fees and charges  from the balance  on loans 10 
onwards, and treat any repayments  made by Mr W as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on these loans. If this results in Mr W having made 
overpayments then Sunny  should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments  would have arisen, 
to the date the complaint is settled.  Sunny  should then refund the amounts calculated 
in A and B and move to step E.
D.If there  is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts  calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus, then the surplus should  be paid to Miss W. However, if there  is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan with 
Miss W. Sunny shouldnt pursue outstanding balances  made  up of principal it has 
already written off.
E.The overall pattern  of Mr Ws borrowing for loans 10 onwards means  any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so you should  remove these loans entirely  from 
Mr Ws credit file. You do not have to remove loans 25, 26 and 27 from Mr Ws credit  
file until these have  been repaid, but you should  still remove any adverse information 
recorded about these loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
Ref: DRN67488214my final decision
For the reasons  outlined  above, I am partially  upholding Mr Ws. Elevate Credit International 
Limited should put things right as set out above.   
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2020.
