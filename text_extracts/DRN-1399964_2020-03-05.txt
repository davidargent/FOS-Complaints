 The complaint
 Mr L complains about a default that was recorded on his credit file by NewDay Ltd 
(NewDay).
What happened
Mr L held a credit card account with NewDay. In July 2017 the account fell into arrears and 
NewDay sent a default notice soon after. That default notice stated that Mr L must repay the 
arrears on the account by 18 August 2017.
In August 2017 NewDay spoke to Mr L over the telephone. Mr L let it know he was 
experiencing financial difficulties, but he was unable to discuss his finances and set up a 
repayment arrangement at that time. So NewDay sent Mr L a form to complete which asked 
about his financial position. 
NewDay sent further notices in September 2017 and October 2017 to let Mr L know his 
account was in arrears and in October 2017, it sent Mr L a letter stating that the account had 
been terminated and the entire balance of the account was due. Later that month, the 
account was passed to recovery agents.
Mr L spoke to the recovery agents in December 2017 and agreed a repayment arrangement 
for £20 per month. The first payment was made in January 2018 and further payments were 
made in February and March 2018. In March 2018 Mr L received a letter informing him that 
his account had been sold to another company with effect from 5 February 2018. Mr L then 
repaid the entire balance at the end of March 2018.
Mr L later reviewed his credit file and found that a default had been registered against this 
account on 31 January 2018 and raised a complaint. NewDay explained that it was the 
company who bought the debt that had registered the default. However, that company 
believed it was NewDay and it was simply continuing to report the information it had 
received. Mr L remained unhappy and referred his complaint to this service.
Our investigator thought the complaint should be upheld in part. He thought it was NewDay 
that had recorded the default as it was the owner of the debt on the date it was registered. 
He didnt think the default had been registered incorrectly as Mr L had been sent the correct 
notices and had been made aware of the potential consequences of the debt. But he did 
think NewDay should have provided more accurate information about the default and who 
applied it. So, he thought NewDay should pay Mr L £100 compensation for the 
inconvenience it had caused him in providing incorrect information.
Mr L didnt agree so the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator and for the same 
reasons.
NewDay told us it hadnt registered the default on Mr Ls credit file and that had been done 
by the company it sold the debt to. But I havent seen any evidence thats the case and 
NewDay were the owners of the debt on the day the default was registered. So, I think its 
likely NewDay did register the default  and in any case it was responsible for any activities 
on the account on that date. So, Ive then considered whether it followed the correct 
procedure in registering that default.
NewDay issued a default notice in July 2017. In that notice it asked Mr L to repay his arrears 
by 18 August 2018 and it explained the consequences if he didnt. It explained that it would 
terminate Mr Ls credit agreement, the full balance would be due immediately, it may sell the 
debt and that it would share information about the status of his account with the credit 
reference agencies. It later sent further notices and a letter explaining that the account had 
been terminated and that entire balance was now due. So, I think Mr L was aware of the 
actions NewDay intended to take if he didnt repay his arrears, and later the account 
balance. And I think NewDay made it clear that it intended to report the default to the credit 
reference agencies if the arrears werent repaid. So I think NewDay followed the correct 
process in registering a default.
I can see there was a long period of time  around six months  between the default notice 
being sent and the default being registered. But it seems that during that time NewDay did 
attempt to work with Mr L to assist him with his financial difficulties  it placed a hold on the 
account, attempted to contact him to discuss his situation and wrote to him several times. 
So, while there was six months between the default notice and NewDay registering the 
default, I think its clear that it was trying to work with Mr L during that time, which is what I 
would have expected it to do.
I can see that Mr L spoke to NewDays recovery agents in December 2017 and set up a 
repayment plan. Mr L has showed us that he made these repayments as he was expected to 
 and so he says NewDay shouldnt have registered the default. But this plan was set up 
several months after the account had gone into arrears and by that time NewDay had 
already made it clear that the entire balance of the account had become due. So I dont think 
this informal repayment arrangement was enough to stop the default being registered. And 
at the time the default was registered, the account had already been closed and passed to a 
third party  so I think recording a default as the status of the account accurately reflects the 
position of the account at the time.
Mr L has now repaid the account in full and wants the account to be recorded as satisfied 
not settled on his credit file. The way this information is viewed and the wording used is often 
specific to the credit reference agency so this may look different depending on which credit 
reference agency Mr L obtains his report from. In this case settled is used to show an 
account that was in default but has later been repaid. As I dont think NewDay was wrong to 
record a default when the account was active, it follows that I dont think Mr Ls credit file is 
showing any inaccurate information for this account.
I have also considered the level of service NewDay provided. I think NewDay should have 
been clearer about who registered the default and that wouldve prevented Mr L from having 
to speak to another company about this issue. I also think it couldve been made clearer to 
Mr L that by the time he entered into the informal repayment arrangement, it was already too 
late to prevent the default being registered on his account as the account had been closed 
several months before. So taking all of that into consideration, I think NewDay should pay 
Mr L £100 compensation for the poor level of customer service he received.My final decision
 My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. NewDay Ltd should pay Mr L a total 
of £100 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 April 2020.
