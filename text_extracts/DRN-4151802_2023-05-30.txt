Complaint
Ms B has complained about personal loans Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 
Money) provided to her. She says the loans were unaffordable.
Background
118 118 Money initially provided Ms B with a first loan for £2,000.00 in June 2016. The total 
amount to be repaid of £3,697.44, which included interest, fees and charges of £1,697.44, 
was due to be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of just under £155. This loan was settled 
early with some of the proceeds from loan 2.
 
118 118 Money provided Ms B with a second loan for £4,985.50 in January 2017. £1,685.50 
of the funds from loan 2 appear to have been used to settle the outstanding balance on loan 
1. The total amount to be repaid of £9,148.80, which included interest, fees and charges of 
£4,163.30, was due to be repaid in 24 monthly instalments of just over £380.
One of our adjudicators reviewed Ms Bs complaint and he thought 118 118 Money ought to 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided Ms B with either of these loans. So he thought 
that Ms Bs complaint should be upheld. 
118 118 Money didnt respond to our adjudicators assessment. So the case was passed to 
an ombudsman for a final decision as per the next step of our dispute resolution process. 
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve explained how we handle complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending on
our website. And Ive used this approach to help me decide Ms Bs complaint. Having 
carefully considered everything Ive decided to uphold Ms Bs complaint. Ill explain why in a 
little more detail.
118 118 Money needed to make sure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, what this means 
is 118 118 Money needed to carry out reasonable checks to be able to understand whether 
Ms B could afford to repay any credit it provided. 
Our website sets out what we typically think about when deciding whether a lenders checks 
were proportionate. Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less 
thorough  in terms of how much information it gathers and what it does to verify it  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship.
But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, a borrowers income was low or the
amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the risk of
it becoming unsustainable and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed expect
a lender to be able to show that it didnt continue to lend to a customer irresponsibly.
The information 118 118 Money has provided suggested that it carried out credit checks 
before both loans were provided. The results of which showed that Ms B was already 
significantly indebted. And at the time of loan 2 Ms B owed more than she did at the time of 
loan 1.
All of this leaves me persuaded by what Ms B has said about already being in a difficult 
financial position at the time of these loans. And while its possible Ms Bs financial position 
wasnt as a result of financial difficulty, Id add that my experience of these types of cases 
suggest this is unlikely, in the absence of any reasonable or plausible arguments from 118 
118 Money, Ive been persuaded to accept Ms Bs version of events here. 
As this is the case, I do think that Ms Bs existing financial position meant that she was 
always unlikely to be able to afford the payments to these loans, without undue difficulty or 
borrowing further. And Im satisfied that, bearing in mind everything, reasonable and 
proportionate checks would more like than not have shown 118 118 Money that it shouldnt 
have provided these loans to Ms B. As 118 118 Money provided Ms B with these loans, 
notwithstanding this, Im satisfied it failed to act fairly and reasonably towards her. 
Ms B ended up paying interest, fees and charges on loans she shouldnt have been provided 
with. So Im satisfied that Ms B lost out because of what 118 118 Money did wrong and that 
it should put things right.
Fair compensation  what 118 118 Money needs to do to put things right for Ms B
Having thought about everything, 118 118 Money should put things right for Ms B by:
refunding all interest, fees and charges Ms B paid on loan 1;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date they 
were made by Ms B to the date of settlement;
removing all interest, fees and charges applied to loan 2 from the outset. The 
payments Ms B made, whether to 118 118 Money or any third-party debt purchaser, 
should be deducted from the new starting balance  the £4,985.50 originally lent. Any 
compensation due for loan 1 should also be used to reduce the amount Ms B owes 
on loan 2. If, after all adjustments have been carried out, Ms B will have ended up 
paying more than £4,985.50 then 118 118 Money should treat any extra as 
overpayments. And any overpayments should be refunded to Ms B;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any overpayments, if any, from the date 
they were made by Ms B to the date of settlement
any and all adverse information recorded about loan 1 should be removed from      
Ms Bs credit file. If no outstanding balance remains on loan 2 after all adjustments 
have been made, 118 118 Money should also ensure that any adverse information it 
recorded about this loan is removed from Ms Bs credit file.
If an outstanding balance does remain once all adjustments have been made, 118 
118 Money should get in contact with Ms B to arrange an affordable payment plan. 
Id also remind 118 118 Money of its obligation to exercise forbearance and due 
consideration, in the event it intends to collect on an outstanding balance and it be 
the case that Ms B is experiencing financial difficulty.  HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Ms B a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for 
one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Ms Bs complaint. Madison CF UK Limited 
should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 June 2023.
