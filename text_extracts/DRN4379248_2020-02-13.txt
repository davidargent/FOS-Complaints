K822xcomplaint
Mr H says Elevate Credit International Limited (Elevate), trading as Sunny Loans,  
irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 30 loans Elevate provided to Mr H between  March 2015 and May 
2017. Mr Hs history  of borrowing from Elevate is attached to this decision. 
Our adjudicator considered Mr Hs complaint and felt that loans 1 to 3 should not be upheld. 
Mr H appears  to have accepted this opinion, so I havent considered these loans further.  But 
I have considered all of the loans when considering Mr Hs pattern of borrowing.  
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Hs complaint about loans 4 onwards  and thought these loans 
shouldnt have been given. Elevate disagreed with the adjudicators view, but it did agree  it 
shouldnt have lent Mr H loans 24 onwards - so Elevate offered to uphold loans 24 onwards  
in line with our standard approach. Mr H didnt  accept this offer, so the complaint has been 
passed to me to make a final decision.
my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Elevate needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Elevate should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN43792482I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Elevate was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Elevate has told us that before agreeing to lend Mr H any of the loans it enquired about his 
income and expenses at the time to check if the loans were affordable for him. But our 
adjudicator felt, and I agree, that by loan 4 Elevate shouldve carried  out more thorough 
checks of Mr Hs financial situation. And that proportionate checks  at this point wouldve 
uncovered that Mr H:
was taking out short-term lending with other  providers, and
was consistently  gambling significant sums  of money.
This is likely  to mean that Mr H may have had an issue with repaying his loans in a 
sustainable fashion. Gambling is highly likely to lead to debt. And with a debt situation 
arising out of, or contributed by, gambling, then a properly carried  our affordability 
assessment was likely  to lead to a responsible lender to conclude that the loan  or any 
subsequent ones - was not affordable for an applicant  in that situation. And this coupled  with 
the fact that Mr H had other short-term loans with other providers ought  to have led to 
Elevate to realise  that it shouldnt  have  lent Mr H any further loans.  So, Im upholding Mr Hs 
complaint about  loans  4 onwards on this basis.
Elevate have argued that there is a gap in the lending between  loans 4 and 5 for about 4 
months where Mr H was not tied into any lending agreement  with it. Ive considered this gap 
in lending but I dont think this is significant  enough  to create  a break  in the lending chain. So 
I think loan 5 and the further loans are all in the same chain for the purpose of considering 
Mr Hs loan pattern. 
 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Elevates lending history  with Mr H, with a view to seeing 
if there was a point  at which  Elevate  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so, Elevate should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 11. I say this because:
Ref: DRN43792483At this point Elevate ought to have realised Mr H was not managing  to repay  his 
loans sustainably. Mr H had taken  out 10 loans within  13 months. Despite  a four-
month gap in the lending in the early stages, Mr H continued to borrow over an 
extended period.  And even though he paid off most of the loans early, he often took 
out another loan on the same day or within a few days  of repaying  the previous.  So, 
Elevate ought  to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr H was having to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances.
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Elevate and the 
amounts borrowed  were not reducing  significantly over this time. In fact, Mr H often 
took out more  than one loan in a month. And although there were a number of times 
Mr M had been  free of debt with Elevate, looking at the overall history of lending  it is 
clear that Mr H was not borrowing to cover a short term financial  difficulty,  but in this 
case, to fuel his gambling addiction. 
Mr H paid back many of his loans early, and thus paid less in interest  than he 
wouldve done if his loans had run to term. But nevertheless, over the period of 
borrowing Mr H had paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to 
Elevate over an extended period.
Elevate says Mr H repaid  many of the loans early, and therefore was not having problems 
managing money.  It also provided evidence to show that as a result of repaying  loans early 
the amount of interest  Mr H paid back for each loan between loans 5 and 14 more or less 
reduced for each loan.  So Elevate  thinks this is evidence that Mr H was not reliant  on short  
term lending. 
I agree  that Mr H paying these loans back early could be an indication  that he was getting  
better at managing  his money,  but I dont think this is the case  here. I say this because 
although some loans were paid back  early,  Mr H was taking out a new loan either before or 
shortly after settling the previous. So this suggests he was not financially stable after paying 
off any of his loans and so needed  to borrow to fill the hole that repaying his loans caused. 
As Ive also said above, Mr H often had more than one loan running  with Elevate at a time, 
and there  appears  to be a pattern of borrowing in quick succession,  paying off a number of 
loans early and then borrowing in quick succession again. I think  Elevate shouldve looked  
carefully at Mt Hs borrowing and ought to have realised that overall Mr H was not managing 
his finances without short term loans and was therefore reliant on this type of credit. 
  
I think that Mr H lost out because Elevate continued to provide borrowing from loan 11 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Hs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also intending  to uphold the complaint  about  loans 11 onwards as I think by this point 
Elevate ought  to have identified a pattern of repeat lending. 
Ref: DRN43792484putting things right  what Elevate needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 4 to 30;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 onwards from Mr Hs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 11 onwards  means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loan 11 should be removed from Mr Hs 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate to take off tax from this interest. Elevate must 
give Mr H a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr H compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 March  2020.
