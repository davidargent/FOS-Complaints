K820x#14complaint
Mr B is complaining on behalf of his business, which I will refer to as P. He says WorldPay  
(UK) Limited wont release funds in Ps account. And Mr B also complains that WorldPay  
closed Ps account.  
background
Mr B opened  a merchant  account in 2012  with WorldPay  to take card payments for his 
business. 
In July 2018 WorldPay reviewed Ps account and decided to close it. On the 11 July 2018 
they gave Mr A 60 days notice that they would  be closing Ps account.  They  said that the 
continuation of the agreement was outside  of WorldPays risk appetite. As part of the closure 
letter WorldPay explained  that they would  be deferring settlement of your transactions  (Ps) 
from the 27 July and disabling refund facilities
Mr B was unhappy that WorldPay wouldnt  release £30,757 of Ps funds. B said theyd 
followed their terms and conditions in terminating  the agreement and withholding Ps funds. 
Mr B complained to our service, saying that WorldPay had unfairly closed Ps account  and 
theyd refused to release the funds without two clear  months  of chargebacks.  He said theyd 
had to take redundancies,  terminate the lease at their office and couldnt submit  their tax 
returns. 
Our investigator looked into Mr Bs complaint. He asked WorldPay  for more information  on 
why they werent  releasing Ps funds. WorldPay said that as per the terms and the conditions 
of Ps account they were only willing to release these funds if theres evidence theyre not at 
risk from potential  liabilities. They said theyd be holding the funds  for up to 540 days from 
the date of the last transaction, and to date theyd received £26,878.56. And they said any 
funds remaining after 540 days would be returned  to P. 
Our investigator said that WorldPay had followed their terms and conditions  in closing Ps 
account and were within their rights  to hold on Ps funds  until they dont receive  any further 
chargeback claims.  
WorldPay accepted  our investigators  outcome  but Mr B didnt agree  he said that WorldPay  
hadnt provided enough evidence to verify their claims. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  And in doing so Ive reached the same 
conclusion as the investigator for broadly the same  reasons  Ill explain why below. 
Ref: DRN24779072I understand that Mr B feels strongly  about whats happened in this case.  And hes frustrated 
by WorldPay withholding  Ps funds but I need to consider whether WorldPay  acted within  the 
terms and conditions of the account.  And I think they did. 
Ive looked at the terms and conditions of Ps agreement. In summary Sections 5.2 to 5.3 
state that WorldPay are entitled to deduct or withhold  funds for any chargebacks, any 
chargeback costs or any Anticipated Liabilities.  And section 5.4 says WorldPay are entitled 
to defer  any amount were obliged to pay you (P).
Ive thought about whether it was fair for them to apply these terms in Ps case. And I think  it 
was. Ive seen  evidence from WorldPay showing theyve received  a number of chargebacks 
totalling just under £27,000 from customers of P. And the chargeback rules say a 
chargeback can raised up to 540 days from the date of the last transaction. I dont  think its 
unreasonable for WorldPay to withhold Ps funds  until the chargeback period has passed. 
WorldPay have explained they will release  any remaining  funds to Mr B 540 days after the 
last processed transaction. And Im satisfied this is fair. 
  
account closure
Ive also looked  whether  WorldPay followed the correct procedures in closing Ps account. 
WorldPays terms and conditions say, depending on the size of the organisation, they need 
to give one or two months written notice  prior to terminate the agreement   and in Ps case  
they wrote  to him on the 11 July 2018 giving him 2 months notice. So I think  they met their 
obligations here and didnt do anything  wrong.
In summary  I realise this will be disappointing  to Mr B, but I wont be asking WorldPay  to do 
anything further  here.  
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above I wont  be upholding Mr Bs complaint 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 January 2020.
