The complaint
Mr W complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to him the money that he and his wife paid for some holiday club 
membership points. Hes being represented in his complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
Mr W and his wife had bought a trial membership of a holiday club and they entered into an 
acquisition agreement in October 2009 to trade-in their trial membership and buy some 
holiday club membership points. The price of the membership points was £23,578 and the 
trial membership was given a trade-in value of £5,995 so the amount due from them was 
£17,583. Mr W entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a 
loan of that amount and he agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £263.14 to Barclays 
Partner Finance. 
Mr W and his wife entered into another acquisition agreement to buy some more holiday 
club membership points in February 2010. The price of those membership points was 
£13,023 and Mr Ws wife entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance for a loan of that amount. 
Mr Ws representative made claims to Barclays Partner Finance in June 2022 under sections 
75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 about the October 2009 agreements  and it 
said that Mr W also had a complaint about irresponsible lending. It attached draft particulars 
of complaint which said that the membership points had been misrepresented to Mr W and 
his wife, there was an unfair relationship between Mr W and Barclays Partner Finance and 
no meaningful affordability checks or assessments were made as to the affordability of the 
loan. 
Barclays Partner Finance said that Mr W was out of time under the Limitation Act 1980 to 
bring any claim under section 75 and that the unfair relationship provisions dont entitle this 
service to give any remedy. Mr W wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was 
made to this service. Mr Ws wife has also made claims to Barclays Partner Finance about 
the February 2010 agreements and a complaint about its response to those claims has been 
made to this service. That complaint is being dealt with separately and in this decision Im 
only considering Mr Ws complaint about Barclays Partner Finances response to the claims 
that hes made about the October 2009 agreements.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ws complaint should be upheld. She thought that 
Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of Mr Ws section 75 claim to turn 
it down. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between 
Mr W and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would 
reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She also said that she hadnt seen 
anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr W.
Mr Ws representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has provided a detailed complaint submission in which it says, in summary 
and amongst other things, that:
our investigator hasnt referred to any evidence provided by Barclays Partner 
Finance or the holiday company and hasnt meaningfully analysed the contractual 
documents or considered the statutory protections afforded to purchasers of products 
of this nature;
similar fact evidence and complaints havent been considered, it has referred to a 
decision issued by this service on another complaint and says that the approach 
taken should be adopted on this complaint and it has described the obligations on 
this service when considering complaints;
the narrow and superficial focus on the contractual documentation disregards entirely 
the misleading and highly pressurised sales practices employed by the holiday 
company and the fact that the contractual documentation was complicated and not 
fully disclosed;
the burden of proof is on Barclays Partner Finance to show that the relationship is not 
unfair and it has breached the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange 
Contracts Regulations 2010;
the omission of key information, the misleading statements made by the holiday 
company and the terms of the purchase agreement and the holiday companys 
articles havent been considered  and it has included its analysis of the terms that it 
says give rise to an unfair relationship;
our investigator hasnt properly considered the issue of affordability in respect of a 
product which involves the payment of a significant upfront capital sum and 
assumption of a liability for annual maintenance fees for a product which doesnt give 
cheaper holidays and has no resale value; and
there has been deliberate, or at least reckless, concealment of at least some facts 
relevant to Mr Ws right of action so the time limit for making a section 75 claim is 
suspended by section 32 of the Limitation Act.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Ws complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ws complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down the claims that hed 
made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years 
of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to his 
claims;
Mr Ws claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining the 
outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ws claim under section 75 is that the membership points were misrepresented to 
him and his wife and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr W could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into buying the membership points in October 2009 as that was the latest time that 
any misrepresentations would have been made to them by the holiday company and 
any loss would have been incurred as that was when he also entered into the loan 
agreement with Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made 
to the holiday company and to Barclays Partner Finance until June 2022, more than 
twelve years later, so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has a defence to 
Mr Ws claim and I find that it wasnt unreasonable for it to have rejected that claim;
Mr Ws representative says that information was deliberately or recklessly concealed 
from Mr W so the time limits are postponed under section 32 - section 32(1)(b) says 
that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been deliberately 
concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the debtor has 
discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have been 
discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a breach 
of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate 
concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
deliberate or reckless concealment of any relevant information in these 
circumstances so I dont consider that section 32 is applicable to Mr Ws claim;
Mr Ws representative says that, amongst other things, the holiday companys 
misrepresentations and selling practices created an unfair relationship between Mr W 
and Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;Barclays Partner Finance has provided an account statement which shows that 
Mr Ws loan account had a balance of £5,726.90 in September 2022 and I consider 
that Barclays Partner Finance should have properly responded to Mr Ws section 
140A claim;
the particulars of complaint set out the representations that Mr Ws representative 
says were relied on by Mr W and his wife and which were untrue, including that:
they would receive a number of points that could be used to book holidays 
each year at any resort within the holiday companys portfolio;
they would be investing in their holidays by securing future holidays that 
would be significantly cheaper than would be available on the open market 
and that purchasing the membership points would enable them to have 
access to cheaper holidays worldwide through exchanges;
there was a ready re-sale market for the membership points which meant that 
they would be able to sell them so they were purchasing an asset;
there would be good availability of 5-star accommodation in worldwide resorts 
at peak times of the year;
they would have access to an exclusive holiday club and the holidays werent 
available to the general public;
the annual maintenance fees would be limited to the cost of maintenance and 
would only increase with the rate of inflation; and
the price of the points was only available, at a rate significantly below market 
value, for a very limited period (during the course of the sales presentation);
Mr W and his wife signed documents in October 2009 including the acquisition 
agreement, the terms and conditions and a members declaration and the acquisition 
agreement shows that they were purchasing 1,600 point rights that would be credited 
to them each year for their use;
the members declaration says: We understand that the purchase of our 
membership  is for the primary purpose of holidays and is neither specifically for 
direct purposes of a trade in nor as an investment in real estate, and that [the holiday 
company] makes no representation as to the future price or value of the  product;
it also says: We understand that [the holiday company] does not and will not run any 
resale or rental programmes and will not repurchase  Points other than as a trade 
in against future property purchases;
information about the maintenance charge was included in the members declaration 
and it says: The basis of these dues is set out in the Memorandum and Articles of 
Association together with the Scheme Rules and Regulations of the Company;
Mr W and his wife had signed the members declaration and confirmed that they had 
read and fully understood it and, if it was incorrect or didnt reflect what theyd been 
told by the holiday company, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them 
not to have signed it;
Mr W and his wife have completed his representatives questionnaire about the 
holiday company and they signed it in June 2022  but that was more than twelve 
years after they entered into the acquisition agreement and Ive seen no other 
evidence to show that the holiday company mispresented the membership points to 
them  and if they had relied on representations that were made to them by the 
holiday company which they later found out to be untrue, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have complained to the holiday company about those issues  but Ive seen no evidence to show that they complained to the holiday 
company about any such issues until Mr Ws representatives letter to the holiday 
company in June 2022  more than twelve years after any misrepresentations would 
have been made to them;
Mr Ws representative says that it has been instructed by a large number of 
consumers making similar complaints against Barclays Partner Finance regarding 
the mis-selling of holiday products by the holiday company with each of its clients 
making very similar allegations  but this service considers each complaint on its 
individual merits and Im not persuaded that allegations made by other of its clients 
shows that the membership points were misrepresented to Mr W and his wife in 
October 2009;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr W and his wife were 
told that their holidays were exclusive and would be significantly cheaper than would 
be available on the open market or that there would be peak time availability, that 
there was a ready re-sale market for the membership points, that the maintenance 
charges would only increase with the rate of inflation or that the price of the points 
was only available at that time;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr W and his wife were 
induced into entering into the acquisition agreement and buying the membership 
points by misrepresentations made by the holiday company;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr W and his wife were 
unduly pressurised into buying the membership points in October 2009, that Mr W 
was unduly pressurised into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday 
company used unacceptable selling practices against them  Ive seen no evidence 
to show that Mr W complained about those issues until June 2022 and I consider that 
it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained about any such issues 
before then;
immediately above Mr Ws and his wifes signatures on the acquisition agreement, it 
says: You have the right to cancel this agreement. You have until [specified date 
later in October 2009] in which to do so  if Mr W and his wife were concerned about 
the selling practices that had been used by the holiday company and didnt want to 
buy the points, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have tried to 
cancel the agreement before the specified date  but Ive seen no evidence to show 
that they tried to cancel the agreement until June 2022;
Mr Ws representative says that the holiday company has breached the Timeshare, 
Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010  but Mr W and 
his wife entered into the acquisition agreement in October 2009 and those 
regulations didnt come into force until February 2011  and Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of any applicable law or 
regulation by the holiday company;
Mr Ws representative has referred to a decision issued by this service on another 
complaint and says that the approach taken on that complaint should be adopted on 
this complaint  but this service considers each complaint on its individual merits and 
Ive set out in this decision what I consider to be fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of Mr Ws complaint;
Ive carefully considered what Mr Ws representative has said about the unfairness of 
the terms used by the holiday company but it would be for a court to determine 
whether or not any of those terms was unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents that Mr W and his wife agreed to in October 2009 have been applied or 
operated unfairly against them and I consider it to be unlikely that a court would 
conclude in these circumstances that the terms of the documents created an unfair 
relationship between Mr W and Barclays Partner Finance;
Mr Ws representative says that Barclays Partner Finance lent to Mr W irresponsibly 
and that no meaningful affordability checks or assessments were made as to the 
affordability of the loan;
Barclays Partner Finance says that, due to the age of the account, it no longer holds 
any credit assessment or records carried out at the time of underwriting the loan but 
the loan account statement shows that Mr W has made the monthly loan repayments 
of £263.14 since November 2009 and Barclays Partner Finance says that hes not 
missed any payments and hasnt contacted it to raise any affordability concerns 
throughout the life of the loan;
the questionnaire that Mr W and his wife have completed shows that Mr W now has 
an annual income of £79,000 and that his wife has an annual income of £56,000  
they describe their financial status in October 2009 as bad but no further 
information about their financial position at that time has been provided;
the loan was made to Mr W in October 2009 and Ive seen no evidence to show that 
he asked Barclays Partner Finance for any information about the affordability 
assessment that it conducted or complained to it about the affordability of the loan 
until his representatives letter to it in June 2022  more than twelve years later  
and, if Mr W was concerned about those issues, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect him to have contacted it about them sooner than he did;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for Mr W in October 2009 when it was made to him or that it was 
irresponsible for Barclays Partner Finance to have lent to him at that time;
Mr W and his wife have referred in the questionnaire to some health issues and 
Barclays Partner Finance says that, if Mr W would like assistance from it, it can 
arrange for its support team to contact him to see if it can offer any assistance;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Ws relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a court 
would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr W and Barclays 
Partner Finance in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance didnt issue a substantive response to Mr Ws section 140A 
claim or his complaint about irresponsible lending that were made to it in June 2022, 
so I cant say that its response was fair and reasonable  but if it had properly 
responded to him I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for it not to 
have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mr W for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership points and the other difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays 
Partner Finance to refund to Mr W any of the money that hes paid under the loan 
agreement, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 June 2023.
