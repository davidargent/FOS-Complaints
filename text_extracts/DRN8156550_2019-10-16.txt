K820x#14complaint
Miss E says Lloyds Bank plc mis-sold her a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy. 
background
Miss E bought  the policy  in 2000  at the same time as taking  out a credit  card.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Miss E disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Miss Es case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Miss Es complaint because:
I think Lloyds made Miss E aware that the PPI was optional  and that she chose to take 
it. I say this because she did tick the box on the credit card application form to show that 
she wanted  the cover. So I think Miss E wouldve realised she had a choice.
Lloyds didnt  recommend the PPI to Miss E so it didnt have to check if it was suitable for 
her. That means it didnt have to ask Miss E about any other means  she had to cover  
her repayments.
Its possible the information Lloyds gave  Miss E about the PPI wasnt  as clear  as it 
should have been.  But its unlikely Miss E would have been affected by any of the main 
things the policy  didnt cover. And the policy was competitively  priced and had a 
reasonable benefit. So I dont think better  information  wouldve stopped her buying it. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 November 2019.
