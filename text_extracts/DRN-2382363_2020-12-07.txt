Mr Ms declared monthly income ranged from £1,680 in September 2015 to £2,060 in 
July 2017. Mr Ms declared expenditure hardly altered for each application   ranging from 
£275 to £125 a month. 
According to Lending Streams records, Loan 14 was returned, and Loans 15 to 19 were 
outstanding and were sold to a third party and so are no longer owned by Lending Stream. 
Lending Stream has sent to us the credit record search results which show that Mr Ms score 
decreased from Loan 1 to Loan 13 and remained at the lower score. The results show that  
The number of active accounts increased over the same period increased from 3 to 9, and 
the value of those active accounts increased from £100 to £1,200. 
Lending Streams response to Mr Ms complaint was For loans 1 to 19, the money that you 
had available after your expenses were subtracted was more than the amount needed to 
pay us each month and would still have left you with some money to spend on other things. 
This means that these loans were affordable. So, we are not agreeing to your complaint.
Mr M referred his complaint to this service where one of our adjudicators looked at it. She 
thought that By Loan 4, when a full financial review ought to have taken place, Lending 
Stream ought to have discovered that Mr M had entered into a Scottish Trust Deed in 
January 2013, and so it ought not to have been lending to him for Loans 4 and 5. And from 
Loan 6 there was a pattern of lending such that it was irresponsible to continue to lend. 
Lending Stream has not responded fully to our adjudicators opinion. It said it was going to 
respond and since then has sent duplicates of its investigation file, twice over. Mr Ms 
representative has asked for updates but has not added anything further following our 
adjudicators opinion letter. 
The complaint remains unresolved and was passed to me for a decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr 
M could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could include several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include: where a customers income is particularly low; where the repayments are 
particularly high; and/or where the frequency of the loans and the length of time over which a 
customer has been given loans need to be looked at: repeated refinancing could signal that 
the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable.
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Lending Stream was required to establish whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  
not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence 
calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable as being the 
ability to repay without undue difficulties. The customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate check for Loans 4 and 5 would most likely 
have shown that Mr M was subject to a Scottish Trust Deed. This was a form of insolvency 
and as such I do not think it was responsible to have lent to Mr M for Loans 4 and 5. I uphold 
Mr Ms complaint for Loans 4 and 5. 
I have also looked at the overall pattern of Lending Streams lending history with Mr M, with 
a view to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Lending Stream ought 
to have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
 
Given the circumstances of Mr Ms case, I think that this point was reached by Loan 6 and 
I say this because:
Mr M had taken 6 loans in seven months;
the amounts he was borrowing didnt significantly decrease over this period - for the 
rest of the borrowing relationship many loans overlapped and so even if an individual 
loan was smaller than the one before, the cumulative effect led to Mr M being more 
indebted than before;
By loan 5, Mr Ms combined and highest repayment monthly sum had increased six 
times from Loan 1.
The pattern of lending itself shows that the loans from here were unsustainable  so I dont 
think you should have given Mr M any of loans 6 to 19.
I think that Mr M lost out because Lending Stream continued to provide borrowing from  
Loan 6 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the sheer number of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about Loan 6 to 19 as well as Loans 4 and 5, and Lending 
Stream should put things right.
Putting things right
You shouldnt have given Mr M loans 4 to 19.
If Lending Stream has sold the outstanding debts Lending Stream should buy these back if it 
is able to do so and then take the following steps. If Lending Stream is not able to buy the debts back then it should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined 
below.
A) Lending Stream should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything Lending Stream has already refunded.
B) Lending Stream should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Mr M which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr M originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Lending Stream should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any 
upheld outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr M as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr M having 
made overpayments then Lending Stream should refund these overpayments with 8% 
simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would 
have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Lending Stream should then refund the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should be 
used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus then 
the surplus should be paid to Mr M. However if there is still an outstanding balance then 
Lending Stream should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr M. Lending 
Stream shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal its already written-off.
E) Lending Stream should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ms credit file in 
relation to loans 4 and 5. 
The overall pattern of Mr Ms borrowing for loans 6 to 19 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so Lending Stream should remove these loans entirely from Mr Ms 
credit file. 
Lending Stream does not have to remove any outstanding loans taken from loan 6 onward 
from Mr Ms credit file until these have been repaid, but Lending Stream should still remove 
any adverse information recorded about these loans.
*HMRC requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. If Mr M asks Lending 
Stream for a certificate showing how much tax Lending Stream has taken off, it should 
provide this. 
If Lending Stream intend to use the refund to reduce an amount Mr M owes, it must do this 
after tax.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint in part and direct that Gain Credit LLC 
does as I have outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or reject my decision before 31 December 2020.
