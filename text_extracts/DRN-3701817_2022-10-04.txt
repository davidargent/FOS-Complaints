The complaint
Mrs A complains about the actions of PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA with respect to a 
negative balance on her account.
What happened
In early 2022, Mrs A made a payment to a travel company via PayPal. She says the money 
was transferred from her linked bank account to PayPal a few days later. Shortly afterwards, 
the travel company refunded the money to Mrs As PayPal account as her holiday had been 
cancelled. However, Mrs A was unable to access the funds. 
Mrs A says that when she called PayPal it told her it hadnt received the funds from her 
bank, so it was holding on to the refund. She says she then phoned her bank who told her 
the funds had been sent so they offered to recall them.  Mrs A says she received a double 
refund into her bank account, but she wasnt aware of this until a couple of weeks later, 
when PayPal told her there was a negative balance on her account.
Mrs A says she raised a complaint with PayPal which wasnt acknowledged for a few weeks, 
so she had to contact it several more times. In the meantime, PayPal kept attempting to 
collect the debt and passed it on to a debt collection agency.
PayPal said Mrs A had received a reduction of £481 from the travel company which shed 
withdrawn to her bank account before PayPal had the chance to receive the funds from her 
financial institution, resulting in a negative balance. It said it was unable to complete the 
investigation using information from Mrs As PayPal account. It required copies of Mrs As 
bank statements to complete the investigation.
After some further communication with PayPal, Mrs As concerns werent resolved so she 
asked our service to look into the matter. She said she would like PayPal to cancel the debt 
as she believed it was incurred as a result of its internal error.
Our investigator looked into Mrs As concerns but didnt think her complaint should be 
upheld. He was satisfied that Mrs A was liable to pay the outstanding balance on her PayPal 
account. 
Mrs A disagreed with our investigators outcome. In summary, she didnt think PayPal had 
treated her fairly or communicated with her clearly. She made several comments about 
PayPals handling of her complaint, including continuing with debt collection activity. So, the 
complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold Mrs As complaint. Ill explain why.
Id like to reassure Mrs A that I have considered all of her points, even if Ive not addressed 
each of them individually. Ive focused on what I think is most relevant to the outcome of her 
complaint.
PayPals records show that a payment of £481 was sent from Mrs As PayPal account to the 
travel company on 13 February 2022. This was funded from Mrs As bank account. When 
PayPal received the refund from the travel company on 20 February, it appears to have 
been sent to Mrs As bank straight away. So, when Mrs A phoned PayPal on 21 February, I 
dont think the funds would have been showing as a credit on her PayPal account. 
Mrs A has acknowledged receiving two amounts of £481 into her bank account on 21 
February. Her bank statements show that one of these was from PayPal. The other one 
appears to have been credited by her bank as a result of her conversation with them.
PayPal says it received notification about the disputed transaction from Mrs As bank a 
couple of weeks later. It then debited £481 from Mrs As PayPal account which created an 
outstanding balance. 
Mrs A says there was an issue with her banking app, so she wasnt aware of the double 
refund until after PayPal sent her notifications informing her of the negative balance on her 
PayPal account. She says that after speaking to PayPal about the negative balance, she 
checked her bank account and saw that PayPal had refunded the money the same day 
shed received it back from her bank.
PayPals user agreement says:
By linking a funding source to your PayPal account, you give us continuous permission to 
automatically charge that funding source (subject to this user agreement and the terms of 
any mandate (e.g. bank direct debit) used by the provider of that funding source to set up 
and maintain that authority) for the required value of the electronic money:
To cover
The payment amount (plus all transaction fees payable to us) when you use your 
account to send a payment to another user.
Any amounts you owe us arising from your activity as a recipient of payments using 
our services, if you are registered with PayPal as resident in the UK.
We may charge the funding source again if the previous attempt failed. If you cancel any 
continuous permission from your funding source, you will reimburse us for the value of any 
electronic money weve already issued for which a charge from that funding source remains 
outstanding.
From what Ive seen, PayPal appears to have processed the transactions correctly. The 
negative balance on Mrs As PayPal account was as a result of the disputed transaction 
raised by her bank. Mrs A has acknowledged receiving a double refund. So, I think its fair 
and reasonable for PayPal to expect Mrs A to reimburse it in line with its user agreement. 
Mrs A says that when she phoned PayPal on 21 February it incorrectly told her that it was 
holding on to the refund from the travel company because it hadnt received the funds from 
the bank. She says this is what prompted her to call the bank, who arranged for the payment 
to be returned.  PayPal says it hasnt been able to locate a call recording or note of this 
conversation, so I havent been able to listen to what was said.I appreciate Mrs A feels that this situation wouldnt have occurred if PayPal had given her 
better information over the phone. Its possible that PayPal gave Mrs A inaccurate 
information about why there wasnt a credit showing on her PayPal account when she called, 
but I dont think it would be fair to tell them to cancel the debt because of this. I understand it 
was frustrating for Mrs A to find that she owed PayPal money. However, shed had the 
benefit of these funds.
Mrs A has raised various other concerns about the customer service she received from 
PayPal and the way it has communicated with her. Unfortunately, I havent been able to 
listen to any of Mrs As calls with PayPal. Mrs A says an agent was rude to her and accused 
her of fraud. But shes also said that the same agent clarified that he was not saying she had 
committed fraud. So, I think its likely that there was some sort of miscommunication or 
misunderstanding during the call. Theres not enough evidence for me to conclude that the 
agent was rude to Mrs A.
Mrs A says she contacted PayPal many times before her concerns were acknowledged. I 
appreciate that this would have been frustrating for her. However, I can see that PayPal 
acknowledged her concerns a few weeks after she first raised them. It also issued its final 
response to her complaint within the relevant timescale. 
Mrs A has also raised concerns that PayPal moved her debt to a debt collection agency after 
shed raised her complaint. PayPal says it did this in line with its user agreement because 
Mrs A hadnt resolved the negative balance.
PayPals user agreement says:
If there are insufficient funds in your balance to cover your liability, we reserve the right to 
collect the amount you owe us by deducting the amount (or any part of it) from any 
payments received in or money you add to your PayPal account. Otherwise you agree to 
reimburse us through other means. We may also recover amounts you owe us through legal 
means, including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection agency.
Mrs A has commented that PayPal sold the debt without finalising its investigation. However, 
PayPal says it didnt sell the debt. The letter from the debt collection agency Mrs A has 
shared with us refers to it being instructed by PayPal to collect Mrs As overdue account. So, 
I think PayPal used the services of the debt collection agency rather than selling the debt.
PayPal says that collection activities have temporarily been ceased while her complaint is 
with our service. I can see PayPal told Mrs A about this on 28 April 2022, which is the date 
after the letter shes provided from the debt collection agency. I appreciate Mrs A feels 
PayPal should have paused collection earlier, but I cant see that it had any obligation to do 
so. Given what it says in the user agreement, I havent concluded that PayPal was wrong to 
pass the debt on to the debt collection agency.
I know my answer will be disappointing for Mrs A. But having carefully considered all of her 
points, I havent found reason to uphold her complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mrs As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 November 2022.
