K820x#14complaint
Mrs D complains that UCB Home Loans Corporation Ltd sold her property at an undervalue 
after taking possession of it, leaving her with liability for a shortfall.
To resolve  her complaint  she wants UCB to admit  that it didn't look into the valuations 
properly and to compensate her accordingly.
background
In 2018 Mrs Ds tenanted property was taken  into possession and sold by her mortgagee  
UCB for £270,000. Following completion  of the sale there was a shortfall  leaving her still 
indebted to UCB. She considers that the valuations obtained by UCB were  too low. The 
house had been fully renovated before she bought it in 2008. 
In 2017 she had obtained from three estate agents  recommended asking prices of £400,000, 
£350,000 and £385,000.  She considers that the market went up by 10% in 2014-15, 10% in 
2015-16, 10% in 2016-17  and 5% in 2017-18.
In relation to the agents consulted by UCB  she says:
Agent A: this is a large chain who sell by quantity not quality. Mostly  modern properties with 
lower values than equivalent period properties.  Large  staff turnover.
Agent B: when  a property has been taken into possession, selling agents undervalue it to 
achieve a quick  sale. This valuer  had no prior experience in estate agency and no 
experience of the local market. He had been a building society  manager.
Mrs D says UCB put her property on the market on 4 December 2017 for £300,000. On 
26 January 2018  it reduced the price  to £280,000. On 9 March  2018 it reduced the price to 
£270,000. There  were a lot of viewings in early  2018 with offers around £200,000 coming in, 
which UCB didnt accept.
On Mrs Ds complaint to UCB it said it generally  required two separate  valuations,  and also 
an independent valuation by a member  of the RICS who wouldnt  be instructed to sell. The 
valuations had been:
Agent A: £325,000
Agent B: £275,000
RICS valuation: £300,000.
Therefore UCB had decided to proceed at an asking price of £300,000. It didnt believe it 
had acted in error.
Mrs D wasnt happy and brought her complaint to this service, but our adjudicator didnt 
recommend it be upheld. The adjudicator said the property had been sold on 
12 September 2018 for £270,000. Although the valuations obtained by Mrs D in 2017  were 
higher, UCB was entitled to rely on the valuations it had obtained when deciding how much 
to try and sell the property  for.
It had obtained  three  separate valuations,  one of which was by a chartered surveyor, and 
based on these  it had decided on an asking price  at an average of the three.
Ref: DRN94076552The asking price  had been reduced in January 2018 to £280,000 and in March 2018 to 
£270,000. There  had been a number of viewings but it wasnt until June 2018 that an offer at 
£270,000 was accepted.  Exchange of contacts took place  on 7 September  2018 with 
completion set for 12 September  2018. There hadnt been any acceptable  offers made prior 
to this.
The adjudicator said UCB was looking  to get the best achievable price. It didnt rush the sale 
 it took ten months from possession for it to be sold. So she didnt  believe  UCB  was at fault. 
It was entitled to rely on the valuations it received. There  werent any interested parties 
willing to pay £300,000 and the price was therefore reduced.
Mrs D didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to look at the case. She said the housing  
market had slowed  down in autumn 2017 but because of a shortage of supply, prices  in the 
area had remained  steady until the end of 2018.  There werent so many buyers around.  
Things had worsened  during 2018. Houses were generally taking much longer to sell.
Comparable three  bedroomed Victorian properties varied in value between about  £240,000 
and over £500,000.  She didnt believe UCBs valuers had found another  house  comparable 
to hers between £275,000  and £325,000.  The house had been completely renovated by the 
previous owners.  She didnt believe UCB had done enough research  regarding  price 
increases in her area. When its valuers  inspected the house it would have been very dark 
inside.
UCB had dropped the price by £20,000 in January 2018 and another  £10,000 in March. 
Over this period  the market was dead.  She had received a higher  offer of £282,000  on 
1 May 2018.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In her response to the adjudicators recommendation,  Mrs D has identified the state of the 
market in 2018, but she hasnt said anything which persuades me that UCB made any error. 
She says it didnt do enough  research regarding price increases, but the answer to this is 
that save as mentioned below UCB  didnt  receive any higher  offers  than the £270,000. 
I dont think UCB can fairly  be accused of deliberately dropping the asking price  in order  to 
achieve a quick  sale without regard to Mrs Ds interests. As the adjudicator pointed out, it 
took ten months from possession for the property to be sold,  and the reasons for that have 
been very well summarised  by Mrs D herself. Theres  no reason to suppose  that increasing 
the asking price would have  achieved  a better result. 
UCBs notes do record  that there  was a prospective  purchaser at £282,000 and that it was 
waiting to exchange contracts, but he had a related sale and this transaction evidently didnt 
proceed.
Ive considered very carefully everything which Mrs D has had to say, but Im not persuaded 
that UCB  made  any mistake here or that there  was more  it could  have done  to achieve a 
higher price.
Ref: DRN94076553my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 May 2019.
