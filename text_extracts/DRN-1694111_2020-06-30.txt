The complaint
Mr L complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) incorrectly advertised the terms 
of an account switch and didn't pay an incentive. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
I know Mr L wants to see a copy of the original advert that was shown when he
applied online. But RBS has told us it no longer has that information as it updated its
offer. Where evidence is incomplete or disputed Ill base my decision on the balance
of probabilities. That is, what I consider most likely to have occurred based on all the
available information. I dont doubt Mr Ls strength of feeling. But I think its more
likely than not that RBSs terms and promotional information matched.
RBS has sent us the terms and conditions that applied to the £150 account switch
incentive in November 2019. The terms say customers have to deposit £1,500.
Mr Ls account balance never reached £1,500, so he didnt qualify for the £150
account switch incentive.
Im satisfied RBS dealt with Mr Ls complaint fairly, so Im not telling it to take any
further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
DRN-1694111Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 July 2020.
