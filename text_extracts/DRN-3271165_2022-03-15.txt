The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank plc acted unfairly when it defaulted his 
account.
What happened
Mr D had a current account with NatWest. There was an agreed overdraft on the account 
which was for £13,000. Mr D says he was abroad during 2020 due to the coronavirus 
pandemic and he wasnt able to access post sent to his address in the UK. He says this 
meant he didnt receive various warning letters or a default notice about his current account.
Mr D says NatWest did continue to send him emails and text messages, during this period, 
but none of the texts or emails told him it intended to default his account. He says the emails 
and texts only stated he should contact NatWest if he wanted to avoid fees on his overdraft. 
He complained to NatWest.
NatWest investigated his complaint. It said the last credit hed made to his account was on 4 
January 2019. His account was passed to the recoveries team in October 2020. Several 
warning letters, a default notice and a termination letter had been sent to the address which 
NatWest held on its records. Mr D hadnt told it he was abroad. It said it had also tried to 
contact him by telephone, using the number it held on its records, but that hadnt been 
successful. So, it didnt uphold his complaint.
Mr D wasnt satisfied with this response. He complained to our service. After the complaint 
was referred to our service NatWest offered Mr D £100 for trouble and upset hed been 
caused. But, it didnt agree it had done anything wrong when it had defaulted his account.
Our investigator looked into Mr Ds complaint. She said that an overdraft was repayable on 
demand. Mr D hadnt made any payments into his account after January 2019. It wasnt until 
October 2020 that his account had been referred to the Collections team. She thought this 
had given Mr D sufficient time to make a payment into his account or contact NatWest. She 
noted that various warning letters had been sent to Mr D. He hadnt told NatWest he was 
abroad or given it an updated address to contact him. She thought the offer of £100 was fair 
and reasonable. She didnt think NatWest should be required to do anything further.
Mr D didnt agree. So, the complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr D doesnt dispute that NatWest sent letters to his address asking him to contact it. It also 
sent letters to his address warning him that the overdraft would be withdrawn if he didnt 
contact it or make a payment. The default notice and termination letter were also sent to his 
address. But, Mr D says that NatWest shouldve sent warnings to him by telephone and 
email also. He thinks that wouldve been reasonable given that he was out of the country 
due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr D has told us NatWest was able to send him emails and text messages about his 
account. But, he says none of the emails or texts warned him that the overdraft was going to 
be withdrawn. He thinks that was unfair.
Ive thought about what Mr D has said here. Hes sent a copy of an email dated 29 October 
2020 which NatWest sent to him. This stated in bold  
Please contact us  we want to help with reducing your overdraft balance. 
The email included details about the overdraft costs Mr D was incurring and explained how 
NatWest could help him. Whilst the email didnt say that NatWest had referred his account to 
its collections team, I think the content of the email was sufficient to alert him that he needed 
to contact NatWest about reducing his overdraft. He didnt do that. 
Mr D also hadnt told NatWest he wasnt living at his UK address during this time. The terms 
and conditions stated that he needed to provide up to date contact details to NatWest so that 
important documents could be sent to him. So, I dont think NatWest did anything wrong 
when it sent the warning letters, default notice and termination letter to the address it held for 
Mr D on its records.
NatWests terms and conditions also made clear that an overdraft is repayable on demand. 
This meant that even though Mr D had an arranged overdraft, NatWest was able to ask him 
to repay it at any time. Mr D was getting his statements online. He wouldve known his 
account had been overdrawn for some time and that no credits had been made to it since 
January 2019. So, when NatWest made clear it wanted him to contact it, I think its 
reasonable to have expected him to have done that to check the position regarding the 
status of his overdraft.
Ive also noted that NatWest did try to telephone Mr D on at least three occasions, using the 
number it held on its records. It did that on 12 November 2020, 27 November 2020 and 12 
December 2020. All of these attempted calls were made prior to the date that NatWest 
issued the notice of default. So, Im satisfied NatWest did make reasonable attempts to 
contact Mr D before it defaulted his account.
Since the complaint was referred to our service, NatWest offered to pay Mr D £100 by way 
of compensation for trouble and upset hed experienced as a result of what happened. So, it 
has accepted that Mr D experienced upset. But, it hasnt accepted that it did anything wrong 
when it defaulted the account. Im also not persuaded, on balance, that NatWest did 
anything wrong when it defaulted Mr Ds account.
Mr D didnt accept NatWests offer. But, having considered everything here, I think 
NatWests offer is fair in all the circumstances. I dont require it to have to do anything further 
to resolve this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint about National Westminster Bank plc. 
National Westminster Bank plc has already made an offer to pay £100 to settle the complaint 
and I think this offer is fair in all the circumstances.
So, my decision is that National Westminster Bank plc should pay Mr D £100.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2022.
