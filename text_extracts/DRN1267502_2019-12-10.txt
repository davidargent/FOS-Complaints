K821x#15complaint
Mr F complains that Provident  Personal  Credit Limited (trading as Satsuma Loans) was 
irresponsible to lend to him.
background
Mr F had four loans  from Satsuma between November 2016 and August 2017 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Repayment Due Repaid
1 21 Nov 2016 £600 12m £99.60 28 Nov 2017 26 May 2017
2 23 Mar 2017 £300 12m £149.40* 28 Mar 2018 30 May 2017
3 31 May 2017 £1,000 6m £316.00 28 Nov 2017 25 Aug 2017
4 29 Aug 2017 £1,500 12m £249.00 28 Aug 2018 31 Jan 2018
* Total scheduled monthly repayment  taking into account overlapping loans
Mr F says he borrowed from Satsuma  to repay  other creditors, but he could not afford the 
repayments. He says Satsuma should have done  better checks  as he ended  up in a cycle of 
debt which  affected  his mental  health.
Satsuma says it asked  Mr F for information about  his income  and expenditure and checked 
his credit file. It says it increased  Mr Fs expenditure figure based on the information  it found, 
but that the repayments were still affordable to him.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She considered that, by 
loan 3, proportionate checks would have  shown Mr F was having  problems managing  his 
money. She said Satsuma should refund interest and charges on loans 3 and 4, and remove 
any associated negative  information form Mr Fs credit file.
Satsuma responded  to say, in summary, that it didnt agree that Mr F was showing signs he 
was struggling financially.  It said the loan repayments were made on time and that the loans 
were all repaid early.  It added that the affordability assessment indicated the loans were 
affordable.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Satsuma was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks  to make sure Mr F 
could afford  to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those checks needed  to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Mr F was borrowing, and his lending  history. But 
there was no set list of checks Satsuma  had to do.
Loans 1 and 2
Im satisfied Satsuma did proportionate  checks for these loans. The repayments  were a 
small proportion  of Mr Fs declared income and Satsumas assessment showed Mr F would 
have had almost £200  per month  left after making the repayments. I cant see there was 
anything else in the available information that should have suggested  the loans were 
unaffordable.
Loan 3
Ref: DRN12675022When Mr F applied for loan 3, hed only just repaid loan 2 and he was applying for 
significantly more money. I can see Satsuma asked about his income  and expenditure and 
checked Mr Fs credit file, but I consider a proportionate check  should  have  included  asking 
him whether he had any other short-term loans. I cant  see Satsuma did this, so Ive had a 
look to see what its likely  to have found.
When Mr F applied for loan 3 he had outstanding  balances with at least  four other  short-term  
loan providers and his payments to such accounts  in June 2017 exceeded the income hed 
declared of £1,413. Given that Satsumas own affordability assessment calculated  Mr F had 
little more than £50 per month left after making the loan 3 repayments, Im satisfied it would 
have found the loan was unaffordable had it carried out proportionate checks.
Loan 4
Again, Satsumas own checks showed  Mr F to have around £70 per month left after making 
the repayments on loan 4. As the loan was for a term of 12 months, I consider that, alone, 
indicated the repayments were likely to be unsustainable for Mr F. But proportionate checks  
would have shown  Mr F continued to owe money  to other short-term loan providers and 
could not sustainably make the repayments  on loan 4.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Provident  Personal Credit Limited (trading as 
Satsuma Loans) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr F paid on loans 3 and 4;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loans 3 and 4 from Mr Fs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Satsuma  to take off tax from this interest. Satsuma  must  
give Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 January 2020.
