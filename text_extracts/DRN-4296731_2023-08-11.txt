The complaint
Mrs S complains that after making and correcting an incorrect drawdown payment from her 
two personal pension plans, ReAssure Limited (ReAssure) failed to correct the information 
shown on her online portal and annual statements. She says that ReAssure still hasnt 
provided proof that it has credited the £500 overpayment back to her plan. Shes concerned 
that without a proper explanation and correction of the remaining issues, she may have lost 
out financially. And that she may end up paying tax she doesnt owe because of the mistake. 
What happened
Mrs S has two personal pension plans with ReAssure. Shed previously taken an annual 
drawdown payment of £3,000 across the two plans 
In April 2022, Mrs S contacted ReAssure to ask it to reduce her annual drawdown payment 
from £3,000 to £2,500, with effect from June 2022.
On 9 May 2022, ReAssure wrote to Mrs S about the requested change. It wanted to discuss 
the request. Mrs S said she didnt receive this letter until after 23 May 2022. 
Mrs S called ReAssure on 30 May 2022. She confirmed that shed like the £2,500 withdrawal 
to be split between her two PP plans using the same percentage as before - 37% from the 
smaller plan and 63% from the bigger one. 
ReAssure incorrectly paid Mrs S £3,000, rather than £2,500. It said that it recalled the 
£3,000 payment on 27 June 2022. And that it received the funds back on 29 June 2022.
ReAssure called Mrs S on 30 June 2022 to tell her about the incorrect payment. Mrs S said it 
told her that once it had received the monies back into its bank itd pay the correct amount to 
her. 
ReAssure paid Mrs S £740 on 8 July 2022. As this wasnt what Mrs S was expecting, she 
queried the payment. 
Mrs S called ReAssure on 11 July 2022 to chase the outstanding payment. She also told it 
that when she logged on to her online portal it said shed been paid £3,000, which wasnt the 
case. Mrs S asked ReAssure to call her to explain why the correct payment hadn't been 
made.
Mrs S said that ReAssure called her on 14 July 2022 to tell her itd pay her £1,575 in three to 
five days. She said she questioned this amount as she was expecting £1,760. But that 
ReAssure told her that the lower amount was due to an income tax deduction from the initial 
payment of £740. 
Mrs S said the payment shouldve been made without tax being deducted. ReAssure told her 
it would look into the problem. She said she was unhappy with the service shed received. 
So ReAssure raised a complaint on her behalf.
Mrs S said that she received the balance of her payment (£1,760) on 20 July 2022. 
ReAssure issued its final response to the complaint on 5 August 2022. It said itd made an 
error, which itd corrected. It awarded Mrs S £100 compensation for the inconvenience 
caused. And apologised for the payment error. ReAssure said it would escalate the issue 
with the online portal.
Mrs S emailed ReAssure on 25 August 2022 as the online portal was still showing the wrong 
withdrawal amount. It was still showing a drawdown of £3,000. So Mrs S felt that £500 of her 
fund had somehow disappeared. Mrs S also said that she would expect the portal to show a 
true reflection of the state of her plans. She said ReAssure called her on 27 August 2022 to 
tell her that the portal would be fixed as a matter of priority.
On 31 August 2022, ReAssure called Mrs S to tell her that it was still trying to fix the online 
issue. The call note also said that it: reassured her that the 500 has been refunded and is 
included in the TV. ReAssure said it would contact Mrs S to tell her when the portal issue 
had been corrected. 
Mrs S didnt hear from ReAssure. So she emailed it again on 23 September 2022 about the 
portal, as it still wasnt correct. She said shed spoken to ReAssure on 1 September 2022 
when shed been reassured that the issue would be dealt with. 
ReAssure sent Mrs S her annual statements on 19 January 2023. Mrs S said that her 
statements showed incorrect withdrawals from her plans. She called ReAssure on 24 
January 2023 to tell it about the incorrect statements. Mrs S said she was fed up having to 
contact ReAssure to try to sort this out. 
ReAssure called Mrs S on 27 January 2023. It said that correct values would be sent within 
three to five working days. It also wrote to Mrs S on the same date to say it had marked her 
complaint as resolved. 
Mrs S wrote to ReAssure on 31 January 2023 to tell it she was unhappy with the letter shed 
just received. She said it didnt explain the reason for her complaint, or what action 
ReAssure had taken to rectify the problem. And that her concern was that monies from her 
plans had been misappropriated. She said shed had no assurance or physical evidence that 
this hadnt been the case.
Mrs S said that ReAssures August 2022 letter had laid out her complaint and outlined the 
resolution. And that this had reassured her that it had resolved the matter correctly, apart 
from the online portal issue. But that the 31 January 2023 letter hadnt given her any comfort 
that her funds were all intact. And that she couldnt check this was the case as the online 
portal was still incorrect. She wanted ReAssure to resolve all of her outstanding concerns. 
ReAssure told this service that it logged a new complaint for Mrs S. And paid her £150 
compensation for the issues shed experienced. But that this had been an informal complaint 
resolution with no final response letter issued. 
Mrs S requested various details on her plans. And ReAssure wrote to her on 9 February 
2023 to provide that information. 
Mrs S brought her complaint to this service on 17 February 2023. She said that because of 
the incorrect information on the online portal and her annual statements, she couldnt 
determine if shed been affected financially. But she felt it was possible that her remaining 
pension funds were now lower due to incorrect amounts being shown as deducted. She said 
she was also worried that shed receive a tax bill, given the incorrect figures being shown on 
her annual statements. She said the whole issue had been stressful to deal with. Mrs S wanted ReAssure to complete an audit of her account to determine that no monies 
had gone missing either by error, fraud or theft. She also wanted it to bring all its systems 
into line with one another. And to provide a detailed breakdown of what went wrong, 
including why ReAssures different systems contained incorrect figures for the same 
accounts.
In response to this services request for ReAssures complaint file, it said that Mrs Ss plan 
record showed the correct drawdown payments and the portal was mirrored off the policy 
record. So it should be correct.
ReAssure also provided this service with information from Mrs Ss plan records. It said this 
information was internal classified information which it asked us not to share with Mrs S. But 
which it felt provided evidence that the plans were in the correct position. ReAssure also said 
that itd arranged for a statement to be issued to Mrs S detailing the value of the plans and 
details of drawdown payments.
This was sent on 15 March 2023. It included unit statements for both of Mrs Ss plans and 
confirmed the withdrawal history. 
In late April 2023, Mrs S told this service shed asked ReAssure to stop payments from her 
plans. And that she was still waiting for revised annual statements. ReAssure told this 
service that this is in progress. And that itd told Mrs S the expected turnaround times. 
In May 2023, Mrs S told this service that ReAssure had called her on 15 May 2023 to say it 
would send out new annual statements and that the problem with the online portal would be 
looked into. She said she called it on 17 May 2023 and said it asked her for screen shots of 
the portal, which shed forwarded. She shared those screen shots, which showed incorrect 
withdrawal amounts, with this service. 
Mrs S also said that shed received an annual statement for one of her plans. But that, apart 
from the date of the letter, it was the same as the one issued in January 2023. 
Our investigator acknowledged that Mrs S had experienced some issues with ReAssure that 
she was still waiting for it to resolve. And that ReAssure could - at times  have better 
managed Mrs Ss expectations. But she felt overall that the compensation for distress and 
inconvenience that ReAssure had already awarded was fair. However, she felt that 
ReAssure should also make an interest payment to Mrs S as the annual drawdown payment 
had been delayed.
ReAssure agreed with our investigators view. 
Mrs S didnt agree with our investigator. She made the following points: 
She felt that the online portal information was drawn from the same central database 
as the annual statement. Therefore she couldnt understand why the withdrawal 
amount shown on the online portal was a total of £3,000, but the annual statements 
showed a total of £4,575. She said that not only did they not agree, but neither 
showed the amount actually taken - £2,500. Mrs S said that ReAssure hadnt 
provided her with anything which showed that the £500 reduction in drawdown was 
ever credited back to her plans. And without that reassurance, she couldnt be certain 
that anything else was correct.
Mrs S also felt that if the online portal issue was a wider problem, ReAssure 
shouldve known about it for long enough to have identified and fixed it. And that, 
given how long shed had this problem, ReAssure didnt seem to want to address it. She said that the current situation gave her no confidence that future drawdowns 
wouldnt be messed up in a similar manner. 
Our investigator then got ReAssures permission to share the system information it had 
shared with this service with Mrs S. She felt that this confirmed that Mrs S had received the 
correct drawdown payments from her plans.
Mrs S said shed reviewed the system information and agreed shed been paid £2,500. But 
said that this had never been the issue. She said she needed information from her pension 
plans  that is, the annual statements and the online portal - to correctly show that £2,500 
had been withdrawn. And that without that, she still felt that shed not been reassured that 
the £500 had been returned to her plans. 
As agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint came to me for a review.
I issued my provisional decision on 3 August 2023. It said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so, I intend to uphold it, for largely the same reasons as our investigator. 
However, I consider that ReAssure should pay Mrs S additional compensation for the 
distress and inconvenience the errors it made after her 31 January 2023 complaint letter 
caused her. Ill explain the reasons for my decision.
I first considered the annual statements and other information ReAssure has recently sent 
Mrs S. 
Statement errors
Mrs S said that shed withdrawn £2,500, but that the annual statements showed a total of 
£4,575. 
From what Ive seen, one of the 19 January 2023 statements ReAssure sent Mrs S 
contained an error. Both statements stated that they were showing policy activity between 
the period 25 December 2021 and 16 January 2023. So the Policy value paid out figure on 
the statements shouldve represented two annual payments. 
The statement for the smaller plan showed a figure of £1,110 over this period. This was 
correct for the £3,000 payment made in 2021  its 37% of this figure. But it didnt include the 
£925 (37% of the £2,500) paid out in 2022.
The statement for the bigger plan correctly showed a total Policy value paid out of £3,465. I 
consider that this comes from £1,890 (63% of £3,000 from 2021) and £1,575 (63% of £2,500 
from 2022). But it didnt split out these two payments. This wouldve clearly been much more 
useful for Mrs S. 
If the statement for the smaller plan had included the £925 correctly paid from that plan in 
2022, the total paid from the two plans, over 2021 and 2022, wouldve been shown to be 
£5,500. But I think that it wouldve been much better under the circumstances if ReAssure 
had simply provided Mrs S with statements which only showed the 2022 withdrawals. 
ReAssure made a further error when it sent Mrs S details of her plans on 9 February 2023. 
For the bigger of the two plans, it stated:You are currently receiving a monthly income of £1,575.00.
This shouldve said that the £1,575 was annual income.  
The 15 March 2023 information sent to Mrs S did include the recent withdrawal history from 
the two plans. But this wasnt presented very clearly. And so caused further questions from 
Mrs S. It gave the withdrawal history as follows:
28/06/2021 - £3,000.00 Gross - £0.00 Tax Paid - £3,000.00 Net
28/06/2022 - £3,000.00 Gross - £10.20 Tax Paid - £2,989.80 Net (This payment was 
returned and applied back on the policy)
07/07/2022 - £925.00 Gross - £185.00 Tax Paid - £740.00 Net (Paid from [the smaller plan)
19/07/2022 - £1,575.00 Gross - £-185.00 Tax Reimbursed - £1,760.00 Net (Paid from [the 
larger plan])
Mrs S wanted to know why, after £3,000 had been incorrectly removed from her account on 
28 June 2022, shed only received £2,989.80 back. She also wanted to know why the £925 
paid from her smaller plan on 7 July 2022 had had £185 of tax deducted incorrectly. And 
why it hadnt been credited back to the correct plan. She questioned if this meant that 
ReAssure had paid tax on her behalf and that in due course she would receive a tax refund.
ReAssure told this service that although Mrs S had been taxed a small amount, it had 
refunded the tax. So there was no outstanding tax consideration. 
I also understand that Mrs S has now had her tax situation independently confirmed as her 
P60 for the 2022-23 tax year shows that no tax has been deducted. So Im satisfied that 
there are no outstanding tax considerations here. But I can see that the information 
ReAssure provided Mrs S with caused these concerns.
In May 2023, Mrs S told this service that ReAssure had sent an annual statement for one of 
her plans. But that, apart from the date of the letter it was the same as the one issued in 
January 2023. 
Mrs S feels that ReAssure has yet to provide her with proof that it has credited the £500 
overpayment back to her plans. And that when it took the incorrect amount out of her plans, 
this should show as a number of units cashed in. And that when it was credited back, as a 
number of units purchased. Mrs S doesnt consider that the withdrawal figures shown in the 
15 March 2023 letter from ReAssure is sufficient proof that her account has now been 
correctly restored.
Im satisfied that the evidence shows that ReAssure recalled the £3,000 payment. This 
money was then re-credited to Mrs Ss account before the correct withdrawal of £2,500 was 
made. So there is no £500 to be re-credited in this case. 
Im also satisfied that ReAssure tried to explain to Mrs S during a call with her on 31 August 
2022 that her plans were in the correct position. 
However, because of the repeated errors in the annual statements, I can see why Mrs S 
doesnt feel ReAssure has provided her with enough proof that her plans were in the right 
position. I consider that there was a significant lack of clarity in the information provided 
which the errors didnt help. Ill consider these errors in the distress and inconvenience 
section later in my decision.I next considered the online portal issue. 
Online portal issue
Mrs S felt that the online portal information was drawn from the same central database as 
the annual statements. Therefore she couldnt understand why the withdrawal amount 
shown on the online portal was a total of £3,000, whereas the amount shown on the annual 
statements was different. She also didnt understand why both didnt reflect the correct 
amount of £2,500.
ReAssure said that the correction to the withdrawal had been completed manually and 
therefore wasnt reflected on the portal. But that it was in progress to be fixed. From what 
Ive seen, it first acknowledged the issue with the online port in its final response letter of 5 
August 2022. But Mrs S confirmed to our investigator on 17 May 2023 that the online portal 
issue was yet to be resolved.
I understand that the online portal does still show that a total of £3,000 was withdrawn in 
2022, when in fact it should show £2,500. And that Mrs S considers that if ReAssures 
systems were capable of addressing the problem, they would now show a £500 contribution 
for the year in question. This is because she feels this would be the only way to re-credit the 
policies. But I dont agree.
I say this because, as I noted earlier in my decision, I consider that the evidence confirms 
that Mrs Ss plans are in the correct position, as the original incorrect withdrawal payment 
was withdrawn and re-credited to Mrs S. It was only after thatd been done that ReAssure 
made the correct withdrawal payment. So there is no £500 to be re-credited in this case. 
ReAssure said that the online portal is in progress to be fixed. 
Mrs S felt that ReAssure shouldve already identified the problem and fixed it. And that the 
current situation with both the online portal and the incorrect annual statements made her 
feel that any future drawdowns would also be messed up. 
I can understand why Mrs S feels that ReAssure should fix the problem with the online portal 
and provide correct statements. It must be very frustrating given how long the issues have 
gone on for. 
ReAssure has provided this service with a copy of the terms and conditions of the plans. 
From what Ive seen, they dont require ReAssure to provide online access to the plans. 
Having said that, its not unreasonable for Mrs S to want access to correct information from 
an online portal shes used in the past. And I would expect all providers to issue correct 
annual statements. So I understand why Mrs S doesnt consider that this service should 
close her complaint until ReAssure has corrected the online portal and issued her with 
correct annual statements. 
However, I agree with our investigator that ReAssure has told this service that both of these 
are in progress. And that this service cant force a business to complete such tasks any 
faster, or in a different way. Therefore, while I acknowledge that this will be disappointing to 
Mrs S, I cant fairly ask ReAssure to take any further action on these points. 
I next considered the original payment error.
Payment error
Mrs S expected to withdraw £925 from her smaller plan and £1,575 from the bigger one at the end of June 2022. But instead, she received £740 from the smaller plan on 8 July 2022 
and £1,760, partly from the bigger plan and partly from a tax refund, on 20 July 2022.
Our investigator felt that ReAssure should consider the payment delays its error had caused 
Mrs S. And that as Mrs S had been deprived access to her funds during the delay, it should 
do the following to put her back in the position she wouldve been in but for its delays:
Calculate 8% annual simple interest on the withdrawal payment of £740 Mrs S 
received from 28 June 2022 to 8 July 2022.
Calculate 8% annual simple interest on the withdrawal payment of £1,760 Mrs S 
received from 28 June 2022 to 20 July 2022.
ReAssure has agreed to take the approach our investigator outlined. 
Im satisfied that the approach our investigator outlined is the correct one. So I intend to ask 
ReAssure to carry out the calculation outlined above and to pay the interest to Mrs S. 
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If ReAssure deducts income tax from any 
interest it should tell Mrs S how much has been taken off. ReAssure should give Mrs S a tax 
deduction certificate in respect of interest if she asks for one, so she can reclaim the tax on 
interest from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate.
I finally considered the distress and inconvenience the issues have caused Mrs S. 
Distress and inconvenience
Mrs S had to contact ReAssure a number of times to resolve the withdrawal error. In August 
2022, ReAssure acknowledged it had made a mistake, apologised, and offered Mrs S £100 
compensation for the inconvenience caused. After Mrs S had received the 19 January 2023 
statements, and made a further complaint, it made a further payment of £150 in February 
2023 for the issues Mrs S had experienced 
I agree with our investigator that a total of £250 compensation is fair for the distress and 
inconvenience caused up to Mrs Ss 31 January 2023 complaint to ReAssure. 
But, as ReAssure then made further errors, causing Mrs S additional distress and 
inconvenience, rather than resolving the complaint, I consider it should pay her additional 
compensation of £300. 
I say this because of the repeated errors in the annual statements and information provided, 
which I consider led to Mrs S having even greater concern that things werent working well. 
And that she couldnt therefore trust ReAssure to carry out any further withdrawal requests 
until the issues were resolved. Im of the view that this led to her cancelling future withdrawal 
requests, thus causing her further inconvenience. 
Im sorry that Mrs S has lost trust in the withdrawal process. I can understand why the lack of 
clarity provided from the annual statements and the online portal has led to her pausing her 
annual withdrawal. I hope that this decision will provide further clarity and allow her to 
resume those withdrawals if she wants to. 
Response to my provisional decision
ReAssure said it would accept my decision. Mrs S said that the only comment she had was that ReAssure still hadnt provided her with 
the new annual statement it had said in January 2023 it would send her in three to five 
months. She said it had also said in May 2023 that it would issue a new annual statement in 
three to five months. She wanted me to stress to ReAssure that it should follow up on its 
commitments. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As no new information has come to light to change my opinion, I remain of the view I set out 
in my provisional decision. 
Putting things right
I require ReAssure Limited to take the following actions:
Pay Mrs S interest calculated as follows:
oCalculate 8% annual simple interest on the withdrawal payment of £740 Mrs 
S received from 28 June 2022 to 8 July 2022.
oCalculate 8% annual simple interest on the withdrawal payment of £1,760 Mrs 
S received from 28 June 2022 to 20 July 2022.
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If ReAssure deducts income tax 
from any interest it should tell Mrs S how much has been taken off. ReAssure 
should give Mrs S a tax deduction certificate in respect of interest if she asks for 
one, so she can reclaim the tax on interest from HM Revenue & Customs if 
appropriate.
Pay Mrs S an additional £300 compensation for the distress and inconvenience 
caused by the additional errors it made after her 31 January 2023 complaint letter.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold Mrs Ss complaint. ReAssure Limited must take the 
actions detailed in the Putting things right section above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 September 2023.
