The complaint
Mr M has complained about the way that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (NewDay) has 
communicated with him. Hes received marketing material that he didnt want and has found 
it difficult speaking to NewDay on the phone.
What happened
Mr M took out a credit card with NewDay in September 2018.
In April 2019 Mr M asked NewDay to stop sending him marketing material. NewDay 
confirmed hed been opted out of receiving marketing material. However, because of the 
way NewDay plan and send marketing material, it may take up to three months for him to 
stop receiving it. NewDay accepted Mr M had had a difficult experience with them and 
offered him £50 compensation.
In June and July 2019 Mr M had a number of phone calls with NewDay and felt hed 
received a poor service. He was offered a total of £140 in compensation for the way these 
calls had been handled.
Mr M continued to receive marketing material and complained to NewDay. His name had 
been spelt incorrectly on the material he was receiving and he was concerned this was a 
sign that somebody had been attempting to use his details to make fraudulent credit card 
applications.
In August 2019 NewDay responded to apologise that this had happened. NewDay said an 
administrative error had caused him to continue to receive marketing material, despite being 
told earlier in the year that he wouldnt. NewDay said this had been put right and offered him 
£90 compensation.
Mr M didnt think the compensation hed been offered was reasonable and referred his 
complaint to our service. Our investigator considered it. He said that NewDays errors had 
caused Mr M to suffer stress, worry and anxiety. He thought the total of £280 in 
compensation that NewDay had offered was fair in the circumstances. Mr M didnt think the 
compensation offered had gone far enough to put things right for him.
As Mr M didnt agree, its been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so, I think NewDay has 
acted fairly, so I wont be asking them to do anything further. Ill explain why.
I understand Mr M hasnt received further marketing material since his complaint to NewDay 
in August 2019, so his original problem has been resolved.
NewDay has accepted that they caused Mr M difficulties and have offered him a total of 
£280. So its not in doubt that they could have handled things better for him. What I need to consider is whether the compensation NewDay has offered Mr M is reasonable, bearing in 
mind the trouble and upset hes been caused by NewDay.
NewDay have told us they held two separate records for Mr M, one with his name spelt 
correctly and the other with his name spelt differently. When he got in touch with them in 
April 2019 to ask not to be sent marketing material, NewDay noted that on one of Mr Ms 
records  the one with the correct spelling of his name. Because they didnt note his 
preference not to receive marketing material on his other record, marketing material 
continued to be sent to him  and with his name spelt incorrectly.
Mr M made a number of calls to NewDay in 2019, which Ive listened to. Its clear he found 
dealing with NewDay frustrating and time-consuming. Had the marketing material not 
continued to be sent to him, I dont think he would have made the calls to NewDay. So the 
time he spent on the calls and the difficulties he had during them could have been avoided.
Mr M has told us he suffers from anxiety and has had a number of problems where accounts 
of his, held with other companies, had been used fraudulently. Hes had problems where 
some of his post has gone missing and has possibly been intercepted. These things were 
already causing him concern before the problems he encountered with NewDay began. 
When things started going wrong with NewDay, he thought it might be connected and he 
was understandably worried about that.
I accept that NewDay has caused Mr M avoidable distress and worry. Given the problems 
hed had as a victim of fraud with other companies, and the way he suffers with anxiety, I 
can appreciate how this had a more significant impact on him than it might other people. 
Taking that into account, Im satisfied that NewDays total offer of £280 is a reasonable one 
to apologise for what happened. For that reason I think NewDay has acted fairly.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 April 2020.
