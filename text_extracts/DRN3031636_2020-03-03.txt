Our adjudicator partly upheld Miss Ms complaint  and thought loan 2 onwards shouldnt  have  
been given. MoneyBoat disagreed and the complaint was passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure     
Miss M could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. 
In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks  might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
Ref: DRN30316362the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MoneyBoat was required to establish  
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations guidance defines  sustainable  as being 
without undue difficulties  and the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  
while meeting  other reasonable  commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet 
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Ms complaint.
Our adjudicator thought MoneyBoat had carried out proportionate checks for loan 1. Miss M 
didnt respond  to these  findings. So, as this loan no longer  appears  to be in dispute, I wont  
be making any findings on these loans. 
MoneyBoat says that before it lent any of the loans, it asked Miss M about  her monthly 
income and normal  living costs. It also says it searched Miss Ms credit file and has provided 
the results of its search.  Looking at the information provided, I think  if MoneyBoat  had 
properly considered Miss Ms financial situation  and the lending,  it would have seen that 
Miss M wasnt  able to take on the borrowing. 
Had MoneyBoat  carried out proportionate  checks before lending  loan 2, its likely to have 
found that Miss M was borrowing from other short-term lenders. The repayments to these 
other lenders were  increasing  her monthly  outgoings by over half her stated income.  
Miss Ms stated monthly income was around  £2,200, and her stated outgoings were already 
over £1,000 a month. So, even before she repaid her commitment  to MoneyBoat, she was 
already over extended.  As such, I dont think she was able to sustainably afford loan 2 and 
MoneyBoat shouldnt have lent it to her. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of MoneyBoats lending history  with Miss M, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which MoneyBoat should reasonably have  seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MoneyBoat  should  have  
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Ref: DRN30316363Given the circumstances of Miss Ms case, I think that this point was reached by loan 4 I say 
this because:
At this point MoneyBoat ought  to have realised Miss M was not managing to repay 
her loans  sustainably.  Miss M had taken out four loans  within eight months.  So 
MoneyBoat ought  to have realised it was more likely than not Miss M was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her 
finances and that Miss Ms indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ms first loan was for £200 and loan 4 was for £500.  At this point MoneyBoat  
ought to have known that it was unlikely that Miss M was borrowing to meet  a 
temporary shortfall in her income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
Miss M wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed MoneyBoat. Loan 11 
was taken out nearly two years after Miss Ms first. And it was for a larger amount. 
Miss M had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to MoneyBoat  
over an extended period.
I think that Miss M lost out because MoneyBoat continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ms indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of 
time.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Miss M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ms ability  to access  mainstream  credit  and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Evergreen Finance London Limited needs to do
MoneyBoat shouldnt have lent loans 2 to 11. 
If MoneyBoat has sold the outstanding debts MoneyBoat should buy these back if 
MoneyBoat is able to do so and then take the following steps. If MoneyBoat  cant buy the 
debts back, then MoneyBoat should  liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results 
outlined below.
A) MoneyBoat  should  add together  the total of the repayments made by Miss M towards  
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything MoneyBoat has already refunded.
B) MoneyBoat  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by 
Miss M which were considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Miss M originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint  is settled.
C) MoneyBoat should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Miss M as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Miss M having made 
overpayments then MoneyBoat should refund  these  overpayments  with 8% simple  interest*  
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
Ref: DRN30316364date the complaint is settled. MoneyBoat should  then refund the amounts calculated  in A 
and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results  in a surplus, 
then the surplus  should be paid to Miss M. However,  if there  is still an outstanding balance 
then MoneyBoat should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss M. MoneyBoat 
shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made  up of principal  MoneyBoat  has already written-
off.
E) MoneyBoat  should  remove any adverse information recorded  on Miss Ms credit file in 
relation to loans  2 and 3. The overall pattern  of Miss Ms borrowing for loans  4 to 11 means  
any information recorded about  them is adverse, so MoneyBoat should remove  these loans 
entirely from Miss Ms credit file. MoneyBoat does not have to remove any outstanding loans 
from Miss Ms credit  file until these  have been repaid, but MoneyBoat  should  still remove  any 
adverse information  recorded about these loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Evergreen Finance 
London Limited  must give Miss M a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ms complaint. Evergreen 
Finance London  Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 April 2020.
