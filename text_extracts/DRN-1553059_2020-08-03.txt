The complaint
Mr W complains about questions he was asked and the service he received from 
TSB Bank plc when he tried to withdraw cash in branch. 
What happened
Mr W withdrew £400 from a TSB cash machine and a further £500 over the counter in 
branch on 21 November 2019. Mr W asked to withdraw another £1,000 in cash and TSBs 
branch staff asked him to say what he needed the money for. Mr W says the branch staff 
accused him of being a criminal and said he intended to use the money for guns or drugs. 
Mr W complained and TSB responded on 2 December 2019. TSB said it asks questions 
about some cash withdrawals in order to help protect all its customers against financial 
crime. TSB also said the branch manager had explained Mr W was quite far from home, had 
no identification and wouldnt confirm why he needed the cash. TSB didnt agree it had 
treated Mr W unfairly by asking questions about his request to make a withdrawal. 
As he remained unhappy, Mr W referred his complaint to our service and it was passed to an 
investigator. She wasnt persuaded TSB had called Mr W a criminal and said its questions 
were reasonable. Mr W asked to appeal and his complaint has been passed to me to make 
a decision.
