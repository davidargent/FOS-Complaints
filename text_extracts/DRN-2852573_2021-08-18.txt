The complaint
C, a limited company complains that WorldPay (UK) Limited made a mistake when it closed 
one of its accounts. C is also unhappy that WorldPay continued to collect monthly direct 
debit payments.
C wants WorldPay to refund the direct debit charges and pay it compensation.
What happened
C decided that it didnt need all three accounts that it held with WorldPay. It asked to close 
two accounts but wanted to keep the Pay-By-Link (PBL) facility.
C was unhappy to find that WorldPay closed the PBL facility. It said this meant it couldnt 
process an order of £1,500. 
WorldPay said it hadnt made a mistake, so C came to this service.
The investigator didnt recommend that Cs complaint be upheld. He was satisfied that when 
C asked WorldPay to close two of the accounts, it was told to specify in its email that it 
wanted the PBL to remain open. As C didnt specify this in its email, WorldPay closed all 
three accounts.
The investigator noted that C was able to set up a new account with a different provider so it 
could collect the payment of £1,500. He also saw that WorldPay had refunded the direct 
debit charges to C.
C wasnt happy with the investigators recommendation. After the investigator sent C the call 
transcripts detailing the instructions it was given when closing the accounts, C pointed out 
that the investigator had overlooked the part of its case relating to WorldPay continuing to 
deduct the monthly direct debits.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to disappoint C but I agree with the investigator that WorldPay doesnt need to take 
any steps to put things right. Im satisfied that WorldPay told C to make it clear that it wanted 
to keep the PBL open. Ive seen Cs email to WorldPay, and it doesnt refer to keeping the 
PBL open. So, I cant find that WorldPay was wrong to close the PBL when it did. This 
means I dont require WorldPay to compensate C for the closure of the PBL.
I appreciate that C was unhappy when WorldPay continued to take payment for charges by 
direct debit after the accounts had been closed. WorldPay says that this didnt initially form 
part of Cs complaint, so it hadnt had the chance to investigate further. However, as soon as 
WorldPay found out about the error, it refunded the charges to C. 
The total amount involved  under £60  was relatively small and WorldPay promptly put 
things right as I wouldve expected it to. I dont consider WorldPay needs to take any further 
action and it doesnt change my decision not to uphold Cs complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask C to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 September 2021.
