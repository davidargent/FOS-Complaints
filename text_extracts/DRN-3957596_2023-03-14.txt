The complaint
Mr T complains about National Westminster Bank Plcs actions when closing his account 
following a switching service.
What happened
Mr T held an account with a third-party bank who Ill refer to as S. In January 2022, Mr T 
used a switching service to transfer his account from S to NatWest. Mr T received a 
message to confirm the switch was successful  including the money held in the account 
with S and his direct debits.
A few days after the switch, Mr Ts account with S closed and NatWest issued Mr T with a 
notice to close the newly opened account with them. Mr T says this caused him distress as 
he had to move his direct debits to another bank, and NatWest held on to around £4,000 of 
his money. Mr T brought the complaint to our service.
Our investigator reviewed things. In summary he said NatWest had provided evidence to 
show theyd closed an account of Mr Ts in October 2020 and made the commercial decision 
not to offer Mr T any future accounts  so he didnt think theyd done anything wrong. While 
our investigator recognised moving the direct debits was inconvenient, Mr T held other open 
accounts, so he didnt think it caused any direct loss. And as Mr T didnt return the funds 
release form to NatWest until around June 2022, he couldnt reasonably say NatWest 
unreasonably delayed returning the £4,000 held in the account.
Mr T disagreed. He said he didnt realise the bank who closed his account in October 2020 
formed part of the NatWest banking group, and he didnt understand why NatWest opened 
the account if they knew Mr T couldnt keep it. Mr T also explained he didnt send the funds 
release form back straight away as he was hoping for a quick resolution. 
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has been passed to me to review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest has important legal and regulatory obligations they must meet when providing 
accounts to customers. Its usual practice for banks to open accounts first and then carry out 
reviews  and it appears this is what happened when Mr T switched his account from S to 
NatWest.
NatWest decided to close Mr Ts account following their review. While Im unable to share 
the full reasons of why NatWest took the action they did with Mr Ts account, Im aware Mr T 
had an account closed by another member of the NatWest banking group in October 2020. 
During this time, the banking group as a whole made the commercial decision to not offer 
Mr T any accounts in the future. Therefore, I think NatWest were reasonable when deciding 
to end the relationship and Im satisfied NatWest complied with the terms and conditions 
when closing Mr Ts account. 
I appreciate Mr T says he didnt realise NatWest formed part of the same banking group as 
the bank who closed his account in October 2020  but I cant reasonably hold NatWest 
responsible for that. And I recognise Mr T thinks NatWest shouldnt have accepted the 
switch if they knew they wouldnt offer Mr T an account. While I can understand Mr Ts point 
here, I dont think its reasonable for NatWest to have known Mr T had a previous account 
closed without carrying out a review. They carried out the review in a timely manner and let 
Mr T know their decision while complying with the terms. So overall, I cant uphold Mr Ts 
complaint on this point.
Mr T had three direct debits transferred over as part of the switching service  and I 
understand why Mr T found it inconvenient to have to move these again once he learned 
NatWest were closing his account. But Ive explained above why I think NatWests actions 
were reasonable in the circumstances. Im also pleased Mr T held other open accounts, so 
he was able to transfer his direct debits without experiencing any direct financial losses.
I recognise Mr T didnt return the funds release form straight away as he was hoping things 
would be resolved quickly. Im satisfied, based on the evidence Ive seen, NatWest made it 
clear they wouldnt be able to return the money without the return of the funds release form. 
Mr T didnt submit the relevant form to NatWest until around June 2022, and he received his 
money back within the 60 days timescale they stated  so I cant reasonably say they did 
anything wrong.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 April 2023.
