The complaint
Mr W says PDL Finance Limited  trading as Mr Lender - irresponsibly lent to him.
What happened
This complaint is about 14 short-term loans Mr Lender provided to Mr W between March 
2015 and August 2019. Mr Ws borrowing history is as follows:
Mr W hasnt repaid loan 14 and so there is still an amount that is outstanding. 
Our adjudicator partly upheld Mr Ws complaint and thought loans 4 to 6, 9 to 10 and loans 
12 to 14 shouldnt have been given. He concluded that if Mr Lender had carried out 
proportionate checks it would have seen on each occasion that Mr W was having problems 
managing his money. Mr Lender disagreed and the complaint was passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why

different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr W could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint. Having done this, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why.  
There was a significant break in Mr Ws borrowing from Mr Lender on two occasions. There 
was a gap of around 11 months between loans 6 and 7. There was also a gap of around 13 
months between loans 10 and 11. I think it would be reasonable for Mr Lender to view both 
of these gaps as an indication that Mr Ws finances had stabilised after whatever the 
circumstances were that had caused him to take out his previous loans (in the first instance 
loans 1-6 and then on the second occasion loans 7-10). 
I did consider the length of time in general that Mr W had been borrowing from Mr Lender 
and whether it was reasonable to conclude from loan 11 that there was a break of lending. 
But I consider there was a significant amount of time that had passed at this stage (13 
months) and in the circumstances of this case, its most likely that during that time Mr Ws 
finances had most likely stabilised. So, I will look at Mr Ws borrowing in three separate 
lending chains. Chain one was made up of loans 1 to 6 and chain two was loans 7 to 10. Then chain 3 was 
made up of loans 11 to 14. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mr Ws complaint about loans 1 to 3 in chain one, loans 7 to 8 
in chain two and loan 11 in chain three. As there appears to be no dispute about these 
loans, I wont be making any further findings on them other than they formed part of Mr Ws 
overall borrowing. 
Chain one  loans 1 to 6
This chain of borrowing consisted of a mixture of payday and instalment loans. Mr Lender 
says it carried out checks before it lent loan 4 to Mr W and the results showed Mr W had 
enough disposable income to make the repayments. But as this was Mr Ws fourth loan in 
two months and the amount Mr W was asking for was increasing steadily on each occasion, 
I think Mr Lender should have been looking to build a clearer picture about Mr Ws finances 
before lending him this loan. I think Mr Lender at this point, should have been finding out 
more about Mr Ws other short-term lending commitments.
Mr W has provided his bank statements for the period of time before and after he asked to 
borrow loan 4 from Mr Lender. I can see that at the time he asked for this loan, he had four 
outstanding short-term loans with other providers. This shows me that Mr W more likely than 
not had become reliant on short term lending and was borrowing to meet a gap in his 
finances. If Mr Lender had carried out further checks I think it would have seen this and as a 
responsible lender wouldnt have agreed to lend to Mr W loan 4 and every loan from this 
point forward in this loan chain. 
Chain two  loans 7 to 10
This chain was made up of predominately instalment loans. Mr Lender says it carried out 
proportionate checks when it agreed to loan 9. But I dont agree and think at this point it 
should have done more. I say this because the amount Mr W had asked for had leapt up to 
triple the amount of his first two loans in this chain. And the amount of time he had asked to 
repay this loan had also increased significantly. So, I think Mr Lender should have, at this 
point carried out a complete review of Mr Ws finances. 
Had Mr Lender done so, I think it would most likely have made a different lending decision 
about this loan and for all of the loans took out by Mr W going forward in this chain. I say this 
because Mr Lender would have seen with better checks that there were clear signs that Mr 
W was struggling to manage his money. At the same time as applying for loan 9, Mr W had 
taken out short-term high cost credit from three other lenders. So, it was most likely he was 
just borrowing to pay off other loans. And there were frequent gambling transactions on bank 
statements that Mr W has provided to our service further indicating it was likely he had wider 
financial problems. 
Chain three  loans 11 to 14
Chain 3 was made up of longer-term instalment loans with terms ranging from 6 to 12 
months. Mr Lender says it carried out proportionate checks when it agreed to loan 12. But I 
dont agree and think at this point it should have done more. I say this because after 
repaying his first loan in this chain that had been agreed to be repaid over 6 months, Mr W 
had asked to lend over a longer period of 9 months and the amount he was asking to borrow 
hadnt reduced at all. I think Mr Lender should have been concerned at this point that Mr W 
was struggling to repay in a sustainable way. So, I think Mr Lender should have, at this point 
carried out a complete review of Mr Ws finances. Had Mr Lender done so, I think it would most likely have made a different lending decision 
about this loan and for all of the loans took out by Mr W going forward in this chain. I say this 
because Mr Lender would have seen with better checks that there were clear signs that Mr 
W was struggling to manage his money. At the same time as applying for loan 9, Mr W had 
taken out short-term high cost credit from six other lenders. Mr W had also repaid a number 
of short-term loans shortly before he had asked for this loan. So, it was most likely he was 
just borrowing to pay off other loans. And there were frequent gambling transactions on bank 
statements that Mr W has provided to our service further indicating it was likely he had wider 
financial problems. His bank statements clearly showed that Mr W was struggling to manage 
his finances.
It follows from what I have concluded above that Mr Lender shouldnt have agreed to lend 
loans 4-6, loans 9 to 10 and loans 12 to 14 and needs to now put things right.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 4 to 6, loans 9 to 10 and loans 12 
to 14;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4 to 6, loans 9 to 10 and loans 12 to 14 
from Mr Ws credit file.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender must give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Mr W still owes Mr Lender some of the principal balance he borrowed on loan 14. Mr Lender 
may deduct this from the compensation that is due to him. But, to be clear, that outstanding 
balance should be recalculated to remove any interest and charges, whilst taking account of 
any repayments Mr W has made on that loan as though they were applied against the 
principal sum borrowed.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ws complaint.  PDL Finance Limited 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 August 2020.
