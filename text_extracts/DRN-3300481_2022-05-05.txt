The complaint
Miss C is complaining that AvantCredit of UK, LLC irresponsibly lent to her.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision. 
AvantCredit lent Miss C two loans and when she complained to it about the affordability of 
the loans it didnt uphold her complaint.
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint and though AvantCredit shouldnt have lent 
any of the loans. AvantCredit accepts it shouldnt have lent loans 1 for £2,000 but thinks it 
did enough before agreeing the lend loan 2.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the adjudicator for these reasons:
AvantCredits checks didnt go far enough, I think given that this was Miss Cs second 
loan and the loan was quite substantial, it should have been looking to build a clearer 
picture of her finances. If it took its checks further, it would have found that Miss Cs 
income was around £1,279, less than £1,583 which AvantCredit based its 
affordability calculations on.
Also, the application shows that Miss Cs declared expenses were around £955 and 
not £600 as stated by AvantCredit. And the results of the credit search show that 
Miss C was making around £385 monthly repayments towards credit excluding 
mortgage. 
AvantCredit has argued that Miss C could consolidate some of her borrowing which 
would make more funds available to her. It has given a break down on how Miss C 
would have done this although it doesnt appear it worked this out at the time it chose 
to lend. However, she was still repaying other borrowing that appear to be borrowing 
from family or friends, she was regularly paying around £562 and I cant see that 
AvantCredit took this into account. 
Also, I think AvantCredit should have been concerned that Miss C was returning for a 
loan that was more than double her previous loan and for a similar reason to the first. 
Proportionate checks would have shown it that Miss C was reliant on debt and 
borrowing to repay other borrowing. This was detrimental to Miss C as her finances 
were suffering adversely and AvantCredit shouldnt have lent this loan in the 
circumstances.
There isnt a continuing dispute about loan 1 and so AvantCredit needs to put things 
right for Miss C on both loans.
Putting things right
Remove all interest, fees and charges applied to the loans.
Treat any payments made by Miss C as payments towards the capital amounts of the 
loans.
If Miss C has paid more than the capital then any overpayments should be refunded 
to with 8%* simple interest from the date they were paid to the date of settlement.
But if theres still an outstanding balance, AvantCredit should come to a reasonable 
repayment plan with Miss C.
Remove any adverse information about the loans from Miss Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to take off tax from this interest. AvantCredit must 
give Miss C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold Miss Cs complaint and direct AvantCredit of UK, LLC to put things right as set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 June 2022.
