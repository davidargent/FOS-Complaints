An adjudicator considered  this complaint and recommended it be upheld  in respect of loans 
3-8. CEN didnt  agree with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
As theres  been  no further dispute  about them, loans 1 and 2 have not been included in my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
Our adjudicator set out in detail why she thought CEN was wrong to provide Mr H with loans 
3-8. In response  to the adjudicator, CEN said:
In response  to FOS [the Financial Ombudsman  Service] assessment which recommends 
CashEuroNet UK uphold loans which were funded after March 2015,  we regret to inform you 
that [we] cannot  agree  to FOS recommendations. Please note that in CashEuroNet  UKs 
initial response to FOS we provided  detailed information indicating  why the loan(s) were  
responsibly lent to Mr [H]. Therefore, we kindly ask that you move  this case for ombudsman 
queue for a final decision.
This Service has responded to CEN  on this generic argument directly and through  earlier  
final decisions. So I am not going  to address this point here, though I have  considered it 
alongside everything else in making  my decision.  
I would remind CEN  at this point  of the Financial  Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance in how 
complaints are to be dealt  with promptly and fairly  (my emphasis) by businesses.  In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
Ref: DRN76764122ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Hs complaint and what  both parties  have said 
about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr H borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in mind  
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect  a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect CEN  to be conversant with these  through previous ombudsman  decisions, 
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
For each loan CEN provided, it asked Mr H about his income and his outgoings. CEN has 
shown us that it recorded Mr Hs income  as £1,436-£1,550 and his expenditure as 
£425-£726. CEN has also provided figures  for what it calls estimated disposable income 
(EDI) and CRA [credit reference  agency] validated credit commitments.  
To give some examples, CEN  says it validated Mr Hs credit commitments as £458 for loan 3 
and arrived at an EDI figure of £701. For loan 4, the validated credit  commitments were £472 
and the EDI figure is £686. CEN says the figure  for disposable income  takes into account the 
validated figure  for credit  commitments  which were always  higher than Mr H declared  on 
his application.
But CEN hasnt  shown us how it arrived either at the validated credit commitment  or EDI 
figures. It also hasnt provided  us with any information about what it actually saw when it 
carried out its credit checks.  This means I cant say whether or not these figures 
demonstrate CEN  carried out proportionate  checks  for the loans Im looking at.
With this said, Ive considered what I think it wouldve been proportionate for CEN to check  
when assessing  the affordability of loans 3-8  and what  such checks  would  likely  have  
shown.
Ref: DRN76764123Our adjudicator thought it wouldve been  proportionate for CEN to carry out a full review of 
Mr Hs finances before approving loan 3. This could include obtaining bank statements 
and/or payslips. I note loan 3 was substantially larger  than the previous loans, commenced 
just four days after loan 2 was repaid and had a final repayment  equivalent  to more than half 
of Mr Hs monthly income. Our adjudicator thought  the same affordability checks wouldve 
been proportionate for loans 4-8, given the lack of gaps in the lending  and that Mr H 
continued to generally borrow large  amounts relative  to his income.
I agree  checks like these wouldve been proportionate, so Ive gone on to consider what  
I think CEN wouldve  likely seen. Ive taken into account information from Mr Hs bank 
statements. In the absence of any other information,  I think its reasonable to rely on them.
Our adjudicator has already set out in detail what she thinks  CEN wouldve  found out from 
proportionate checks. CEN didnt provide any new information in response to the 
adjudication and simply reiterated that it didnt  think any of the loans it provided after March  
2015 couldve been approved irresponsibly. As CEN didnt challenge or otherwise  comment  
on the figures the adjudicator arrived at I dont intend to go into as much detail as she did. 
But I have reviewed all of the figures in detail  and am in agreement  with them.
Broadly, our adjudicator  thought that proportionate  checks wouldve shown CEN that loans 
3-8 were  not sustainably  affordable for Mr H. This was because his outgoings,  including 
usual monthly living  costs and existing credit  commitments, didnt leave him with enough  
disposable income to make repayments  to CEN from his income.
To give some examples, I think proportionate checks  at the time of loans 3 and 4 wouldve 
likely shown  CEN that Mr Hs disposable  income was no more than £300-£400  far lower 
than the largest  payments on these loans.
For loan 5, Ive seen that Mr Hs outgoings  were similar, but that there was evidence of 
significant expenditure on gambling, which likely meant Mr H wouldnt have been able to 
sustainably repay  this loan.
And for loans 6-8, Mr Hs income  averaged  about  £1,600 a month  but his expenditure wasnt  
much lower  than this. Loan 6 was a bit different, in that his income was around  £1,600  and 
his expenditure  £900  so his disposable  income was around £700 at that time. But the 
largest payment  on loan 6 was £811. It may be that CEN expected  Mr H to save money 
from August to make the largest contractual September payment. But given that Mr H had 
been regularly  accessing high-cost short-term credit  for well over a year, I dont think  it was 
reasonable for CEN  to accept Mr H was in a position  to, or was likely to, save money.
Ref: DRN76764124I also think its likely the pattern of lending alone ought to have altered CEN to a problem.  
Mr H took out six high-cost short-term loans (loans 2-7) between November 2016 and 
October 2017, with little break between these  loans. Loan 8 was then a high-cost 12 month 
instalment loan, which would mean Mr H would be indebted to CEN, paying  high rates  of 
interest, for another  12 months if the loan ran to term. In Mr Hs case, I think the point at 
which CEN ought to have  realised from the pattern of lending  alone that the lending  wasnt 
sustainable was by loan 6. The amount Mr H borrowed for loan 6 was only £50 less than for 
loan 3 and was for a larger amount than most of the loans up to that point.
But I dont need  to make  a definitive finding  about  the pattern of lending, as for the reasons 
Ive given above, I think proportionate checks wouldve shown CEN that loans  3-8 were not 
sustainably affordable for Mr H. Im upholding his complaint about loans 3-8 for the reasons 
given above.
putting things right
refund  the interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 3-8
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Mr H paid them, until the 
date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  loans 3-8 from Mr Hs credit  history
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires CEN to take off tax from this interest. CEN must  give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2019.
