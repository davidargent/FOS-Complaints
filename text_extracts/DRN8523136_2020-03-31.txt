Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Gs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given because the overall  pattern  of Mr Gs borrowing indicated  he was 
reliant on these loans and the borrowing was becoming unsustainable.  
Sunny disagreed but offered to uphold the complaint from loan 11 onwards.  It also explained 
it had written off a balance of around £835 in April 2019 so nothing  further was owed to      
Mr G. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could  
Ref: DRN85231362repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint. Having done  so, I am partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Gs complaint  about loans 1 to 5. Mr G hasnt provided any 
further evidence  or arguments for us to consider, so I wont be making any further findings 
on these loans because  they no longer appear  to be in dispute. 
In reviewing the complaint, Ive looked  at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history  with 
Mr G, with a view to seeing if there  was a point at which  Sunny should  reasonably  have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.  And so Sunny should  have 
realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
Ref: DRN85231363At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr G was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr G had taken out six instalment loans  in just under eight months. So, it 
should have realised it was more likely than not Mr G was having to borrow further  to 
cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Gs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Gs first loan was for £200 and loan 6 was for the same amount. At this point, 
Sunny ought to have known it was unlikely that Mr G was borrowing  to meet  a 
temporary shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr G was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of taking out 
his previous one. 
Mr G wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  15 was 
taken out 19 months after Mr Gs first loan.  This meant hed paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect; service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Gs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr D paid on loans 6 to 15 not including  anything  it 
has already refunded;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6 to 15 should be removed from  
Mr Ds credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Elevate Credit International Limited  to take off tax from this 
interest. Elevate Credit  International  Limited must give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its 
taken off if he asks for one. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Ref: DRN85231364Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2020.
