DRN-3168944
The complaint
Mr Rs complaint is about his retirement annuity contract (section 226 policy) with Phoenix
Life Assurance Limited (Phoenix Life). Mr Rs concerns centre on the performance of his
policy and in particular that annual bonuses havent been paid for some years. Any terminal
bonus appears unlikely too.
What happened
Ive considered Mr Rs complaint before. I issued a provisional decision on 27 October 2021. 
Ive recapped here what I said about the background to the complaint and my provisional 
findings. 
Mr R took out his policy with Australian Mutual Provident Society (AMP) in 1985. AMP later
became part of Phoenix Life. Premiums were invested in the providers with profits fund and
went to providing a guaranteed sum assured of £15,619 at Mr Rs NRD (normal retirement
date) which was his 70th birthday in August 2018. Up until 2004/2005 bonuses were added
to the plan. By Mr Rs NRD the guaranteed fund value was £37,346.90, made up of the sum
assured of £15,619 plus bonuses totalling £21,727.90.
Mr R telephoned Phoenix Life on 7 August 2018. He was unhappy that no terminal bonus
had been paid and with the performance of his policy generally.
Phoenix Life wrote to Mr R in response on 8 October 2018. Phoenix Life apologised for the
time it had taken to reply. It said it was unable to uphold Mr Rs complaints about the non
payment of a terminal bonus and the overall performance of the policy. It apologised if Mr R
felt that, since 2005, hed paid in over £6,000 but was no better off financially. A booklet
about with profits bonuses was enclosed. Phoenix Life said it would pay Mr R £50 (to be
sent by cheque in the next few days) for the time taken to reply to his complaint. Referral
rights to this service were given. Phoenix Life said Mr R must do that within six months of the
date of the letter and, if he didnt refer the complaint in time, we wouldnt have Phoenix Lifes
permission to consider the complaint.
Mr R wrote to Phoenix Life again on 26 November 2018. He said his plan had finished in
August 2018 and no further payments were due. But two payments had been taken after
then. He referred to a letter from Phoenix Life dated 20 September 2018, saying interest
could be added.
In its letter to Mr R dated 11 December 2018, Phoenix Life explained that the policy had
originally been written to age 70. It had then automatically deferred to age 75. The plan
could be made paid up at age 70 in which case no further arrears letters would be sent. Or
Mr R could continue to pay premiums to age 75. In that case hed need to pay the arrears
and set up his direct debit again.
Phoenix Life wrote to Mr R again on 4 January 2019. It apologised for the trouble and upset
hed been caused. When he reached NRD Phoenix Life shouldve informed him that his
policy would automatically defer to age 75 and that his premiums would continue to be
collected. Arrears letters were automatically issued when Phoenix Lifes systems realised
the direct debit had been cancelled. Phoenix Life said it didnt intend to appear threatening
and it was sorry if it had come across that way. Phoenix Life referred to its letter of 11
December 2018 which explained things. If Mr R wanted the two premiums returned Phoenix
Life would find out if that was possible. It had arranged to pay £100 directly into Mr Rs
account in recognition of the inconvenience and confusion hed been caused. Referral rights
to this service were again given.
Things werent resolved and correspondence continued. I havent referred to each and every
exchange or every point made. Ive just summarised what the key letters said.
Mr Rs letter of 12 January 2019: He said his fund hadnt increased in value since 2004.
Even though hed paid in another £6,700. He questioned why hed want to pay in a further
£2,300. Hed had valuations of £39,800 and £39,400 before it had gone back to what it was
worth in 2004. Hed like to know what Phoenix Life had done with the premiums hed paid
since 2004 as the value of his plan hadnt increased.
Phoenix Lifes letter of 8 February 2019: As its letter of 4 January 2019 set out, Mr Rs
contributions would continue to be collected past his NRD (age 70) if he didnt take his
benefits then. Phoenix Life had apologised and confirmed that it shouldve informed Mr R
that his policy would automatically be deferred to age 75 if it didnt hear from him. Mr Rs
comments about performance had been referred to its servicing department whod write to
Mr R separately in the next ten working days.
Phoenix Lifes letter of 12 February 2019. It repeated that the policy had been written to age
70. Premiums went to providing the guaranteed sum assured, £15,619 at NRA in August
2018. In addition, bonuses totalling £21,727.90 had been added to the policy so at NRD the
plan had acquired a total value of £37,346.90. As no benefits were paid out at NRD the plan
was automatically extended to age 75 (August 2023). The figures were recalculated on the
assumption that premium payments would continue to the new retirement date. The
guaranteed pension fund payable at the new retirement date in August 2023 would be
£47,551.50, made up of the sum assured (£19,937) and total annual bonus (£27,614.50).
The last premium paid was paid on 5 September 2018. Assuming that no further premium
payments were made, the revised guaranteed pension fund available in August 2023 would
be £44,929.50, made up of the paid up sum assured (£17,315) and total annual bonus
(£27,614.50). If retirement was before August 2023 the guaranteed pension fund would be
reduced accordingly.
Mr Rs letter of 3 May 2019: He asked if bonuses for next five years could be guaranteed.
And he queried why no bonuses had been added for last fifteen years and why no terminal
bonus would be paid.
Phoenix Lifes letter of 16 May 2019: It said that profits arising from the with profits fund were
used to add bonuses to plans, after first providing for any guaranteed benefits. The primary
goal was to ensure all plan holders guaranteed benefits were protected. Currently the value
of the benefits guaranteed under Mr Rs plan (the sum assured plus declared bonuses)
exceeded the fair share of the with profits fund. So new annual bonuses wouldnt be added.
Any final bonus is only paid when benefits are claimed. Final bonuses werent guaranteed
and most final bonus rates were set to zero because the value of the guaranteed benefits
exceeds the fair share of the with profits fund.
Phoenix Lifes letter of 27 June 2019: The current reversionary bonus rate was 0% and had
been for the past five years. That rate had been declared for all with profit pension plans and
wasnt specific to Mr Rs plan. The bonuses that had previously been added are guaranteed
to be available at NRD to provide his pension benefits.Mr Rs letter of 6 July 2019: He didnt think his queries had been answered. He asked what a
reversionary bonus was and why it had been set at 0% for last five years. He also queried
why the terminal bonus rate was 0%. And why the New Year bonus had been set at 0% for
the last fifteen years.
Phoenix Lifes letter of 15 July 2019: It explained that on each anniversary date from the
setting up of the plan, the overall profit is looked at and a percentage allocated as
reversionary (not New Year) bonuses. Terminal bonus may be added but arent guaranteed.
Since 2004/2005 bonuses  reversionary and terminal bonuses  hadnt been allocated.
Bonuses already allocated cant be removed or reduced. Phoenix Life set out the bonuses
allocated each year from 1986 and the total bonus amount - £21,725.10 - as at 5 February
2004. That had increased by nominal amounts to £21,727.90 by 5 February 2013 and had
stayed the same since.
Phoenix Lifes letter dated 18 October 2019: Phoenix Life set out its understanding of Mr Rs
complaint, listing seven points. In summary:
1. Mr R had been promised a terminal bonus at NRD but that didnt happen.
2. Despite paying in an additional £7,000 his policy was still worth £37,000.
3. He was unhappy with the performance of the policy. His other policies with other
providers had done much better.
4. Phoenix Life had taken premiums for two months after his NRD without asking him if
he wanted to carry on contributing or not. Phoenix Life had said it would refund them
but hadnt.
5. Hed been getting substantial New Year bonuses between February 1990 and
February 2003. But these had stopped when Phoenix Life took over.
6. Hed like to know what happened to annual bonuses.
7. Phoenix Life hadnt answered his previous questions.
Phoenix Life said points 1 to 3 had been fully investigated and a final response sent to Mr R
on 8 October 2018. Mr R had also previously complained about point 4 and Phoenix Life had
written to him about it on 4 January 2019. As Mr R had now indicated he wanted a refund
that had been arranged. Phoenix Life had answered points 5 and 6 in its letter of 15 July
2019.
Phoenix Life said its practice, when dealing with a complaint about performance, was to
review the advice given when the policy had been set up. As that hadnt been done, Phoenix
Life went on to consider that. Mr R had been self employed and a pension plan was suitable
for his needs. Hed contributed to it until 5 September 2011 (I think that should have read
2018) which confirmed it was affordable. His attitude to risk hadnt been assessed at the
time. But the policy was a conventional with profits arrangement and suitable for cautious
investors. The advice Mr R had been given to take out the policy had been correct.
Phoenix Life said it hadnt answered all of Mr Rs questions. Including an issue hed raised in
his letter of 12 January 2019 when hed said hed had valuations of £39,000 and £39,400 but
theyd then gone back to what the policy was worth in 2004. Phoenix Life had looked at all 
the annual statements and quotations going back to 7 November 2013  it was only required
to store records for six years and so that was the earliest available. Phoenix Life said it
hadnt seen any valuations in excess of £39,000.
All of the statements up to 6 February 2018 showed a guaranteed pension fund at in August
2018 of £37,346.90. The retirement quote of 27 May 2018 showed estimated pension
savings of £37,191.58. The retirement quote dated 30 July 2018 showed estimated pension
savings of £37,346.90 (made up of the guaranteed sum assured of £15,619 plus a total of£21,727.90 in bonuses). At Mr Rs NRD in August 2018 his pension fund had acquired a
total guaranteed value of £37,346.90.
The annual statement of 24 April 2019 confirmed a guaranteed pension fund in August 2023
of £44,929.50. As no benefits were paid out at NRD the plan was automatically extended to
age 75. The figures were recalculated to take into account that premium payments would
continue to the new retirement date. On this assumption the sum assured was increased to
£19,937.00 and the total annual bonus remained at £27,614.50, giving a guaranteed
pension fund of £47,551.50. When Mr R confirmed he didnt want to pay further premiums
the sum assured was adjusted to £17,315. The bonuses that were already added
(£27,614.50) are guaranteed. The revised guaranteed pension fund available in August 2023 
was £44,929.50.
Phoenix Life apologised that it hadnt answered the questions Mr R raised in his letter of 6
July 2019 and went on to deal with those points. First, it wasnt the case that the profit from
Mr Rs fund was being used to boost other investors funds. Mr R was invested in a
conventional with profits policy. He didnt have his own fund. His premiums buy a basic sum
assured, which, in effect, buys a proportionate share of the profits of the central with profits
fund. It wasnt possible for profits to be moved from one persons fund to anothers as
personal funds dont exist. Everyone participates in the fund according to their share and as
such profits are distributed fairly according to that relative share.
Secondly, Phoenix Life agreed that it was saying that Mr R had had more than his fair share
of bonuses. His policy has a guaranteed value made up of the basic sum assured (which
was stated at the outset of the policy) plus any bonuses that have been declared over the
years and which cant be removed from the policy. But investment conditions vary greatly
over the lifetime of the policy and had been particularly volatile over the past fifteen years or
so. Phoenix Life had decided to stop adding bonuses on an annual basis as it couldnt be
confident that investment returns would be such that it would be able to pay these in the
future.
Instead it looked at each policy whenever a claim is made or the policy matures and
considers the profits made by the central with profits fund as a whole over the term of that
policy. The relative share of those profits is compared to the amount already added to the
policy. If this share is less than the total current bonuses theres no more to be added. But if
the policys share exceeds the guaranteed value, the difference would be addressed by
means of a terminal bonus.
Phoenix Life offered £100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused by not dealing
with Mr Rs queries plus £50 for the delay in dealing with his complaint.
Our investigation
Mr R remained unhappy and asked us to look into his concerns. We received his complaint
form on 18 March 2020. Amongst other things, he said that, since about 2005, Phoenix Life
had stopped adding annual bonuses. Hed paid in another £7,000 but the value of his
pension hadnt increased. Hed been told that annual bonuses had been stopped so that
funds to pay terminal bonuses could be built up. But that hadnt happened either. Annual
bonuses had averaged £1,286 until Phoenix Life had taken over. He accepted there were
good and bad years but he had four other plans which had done much better. He wanted
Phoenix Life to reassess the value of his policy in line with those plans.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Rs complaint. In her view dated 1 February 2021
she said we couldnt consider all aspects of the complaint as some issues had been referred
to us more than six months after Phoenix Life had issued its final response letter. She didntthink Phoenix Life needed to take any further action. In summary she said:
The policy had been appropriate for Mr R in 1985. He was self employed and not
contributing to a workplace pension. A with profits fund was appropriate for an
inexperienced investor. There was nothing to suggest that the regulator was
concerned with how Phoenix Lifes with profit fund had been managed. Mr R had
contributed for some time so it seemed the policy was affordable. The advice to set
up the retirement annuity contract had been appropriate.
Phoenix Lifes letter of 15 July 2019 set out a breakdown of annual bonuses paid.
Bonuses had decreased significantly from February 2005 and hadnt been paid since
February 2013. But the payment of annual bonuses (and any terminal bonus) wasnt
guaranteed.
Phoenix Life had paid compensation of £150 for not dealing with Mr Rs questions.
Mr R said the last letter from Phoenix Life about his complaint was dated 18 October 2019.
Hed contacted us on 18 March 2020, well within the six month period. The investigator
agreed that Mr R had referred his complaint within six months of the 18 October 2019 letter.
But previous final response letters had confirmed that Mr R could get in touch with us.
Mr R remained unhappy. We told him and Phoenix Life that the complaint would be referred
to an ombudsman.
Mr R said the main points of his complaint were why had no yearly bonuses been added
since 2004 when Phoenix Life had taken over the policy and why no terminal bonus had
been paid when the policy matured. He said he could accept one or the other but not both.
Especially since hed invested a further £7,000 since 2004 which didnt increase the value of
the policy.
Mr R also told us more recently that the value of his policy had fallen. He forwarded recent
annual statements which showed the guaranteed pension was now only £26,131.67.
That didnt seem right and so we queried it with Phoenix Life.
It wrote to Mr R on 28 September 2021 enclosing a revised benefit statement. Phoenix Life
apologised that the previous statement had been incorrect and for the time taken to correct
it. The revised statement showed an assumed pension date of Mr Rs 75th birthday in August
2023 and a guaranteed pension fund of £44,839.50, made up of the sum assured of £17,225
and total permanent bonuses of £27,614.50.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Jurisdiction
Ive considered Mr Rs complaint and whether we can look into all the points hes raised
before. I issued a jurisdiction decision on 3 September 2021. I explained that Mr R had
referred his complaint to us within six months of Phoenix Lifes final response letter dated 18
October 2019. But earlier final response letters had been issued on 8 October 2018 and 4
January 2019. Both included referral rights to this service. If Mr R had wanted us to consider
the issues hed raised, he needed to refer his complaint(s) to us within six months of the final
response letters. As he didnt contact us until March 2020 that meant his complaint, or parts
of it at least, had been made too late and we cant consider those aspects of the matter.We keep jurisdiction under review throughout our consideration of a complaint. Ive done
that. And I think I made a mistake in my jurisdiction decision about points 5 and 6 set out in
Phoenix Lifes letter of 18 October 2019.
Phoenix Lifes letter of 15 July 2019 did deal with points 5 and 6. But (and unlike Phoenix
Lifes letters of 8 October 2018 and 4 January 2019) that letter didnt say that if Mr R
remained unhappy, he could refer those issues to this service. Referral rights in respect of
points 5 and 6 were given in Phoenix Lifes letter of 18 October 2019. Mr Rs complaint was
referred to us on 18 March 2020 which is within six months.
Im sorry for any confusion. But I now think I can consider points 5 and 6 of Mr Rs complaint.
Ill also be looking at the sale of the policy, the differing valuations Mr R has received
(including the two statements hes more recently received) and the queries he raised which
Phoenix Life didnt answer until its letter of 18 October 2019.
That still means I wont be I wont be dealing with all aspects of Mr Rs complaint as such, for
example, the performance of his policy. I note what hes said about his circumstances being
exceptional  that his retirement annuity contract will be the pension for the rest of his life;
that there was no increase in value for over ten years, even though hed paid in another
£7,000; and that he didnt agree to Phoenix Life taking over the policy in the first place. But I
still dont think his circumstances were exceptional and such that prevented him from
bringing some aspects of his complaint to this service earlier and within the six month
deadline set out in Phoenix Lifes final response letters.
Before going on to deal with the complaints I can look into, Ive started by briefly setting out
how Mr Rs policy and the with profits fund works.
Mr Rs policy
Mr R has a conventional retirement annuity contract (a section 226 policy). The policy is a
contract between Mr R and Phoenix Life (originally AMG) to pay the sum guaranteed at the
outset at NRD, provided that premiums are maintained. Mr Rs premiums are invested in the
providers with profits fund. Entitlement to the guaranteed sum isnt dependent on how the
underlying fund performs.
Annual bonuses may be added but they arent guaranteed. Bonuses, once added, cant
then be removed, assuming that premiums continue to be paid and the policy holder doesnt
retire before NRD. I note here that Mr R says hes paid in a further £7,000 since 2004 and
hes not had anything in return for that money. But, as Ive said, the guaranteed sum assured
and the bonuses added are on the basis that the premiums are maintained. If premiums
cease then the sum assured and any bonuses added can be scaled back.
A terminal bonus may be payable but again this isnt guaranteed and the amount of any
terminal bonus wont be known until the policyholder actually retires. Mr R has referred to
New Year bonuses but I think these are in fact the annual bonuses and not another type of
bonus that might be payable.
Whether bonuses are paid and, if so, how much, depends on, amongst other things, how the
underlying fund performs. Here thats a with profits fund. Thats a pooled investment fund.
The premiums Mr R paid are combined with the money paid in by other investors and
invested in a mix of assets.
Investors are generally less likely to be unhappy with performance of their with profits
investments whilst bonuses are being paid. But, if with profits investments attract low or zero
bonuses, investors may understandably become concerned as to how their investment isperforming and whether they are being treated fairly. That seems to have been Mr Rs
position. His concerns date back to 2004/2005 when annual bonuses started to be reduced.
With profits funds have attracted criticism for their lack of transparency. The regulator
recognised that investors were concerned about the opaque nature of with profits funds and
that it was difficult for investors to be satisfied that they were receiving what they are entitled
to under the terms of their policy.
Since 2004 with profits fund providers must publish a Principles and Practices of Financial
Management (PPFM) document, which explains, amongst other things, the steps taken in
managing the returns and level of guarantees within the fund. Businesses are required to
appoint a with-profits actuary and the regulator provides guidance on their duties. Phoenix
Life also has an independent With Profits Committee whose remit includes supporting
Phoenix Life in discharging its governance responsibilities in relation to compliance with
PPFM and providing an independent judgment in assessing that and how any competing or
conflicting rights and interests of policyholders and, if applicable, shareholders have been
addressed.
Mr R may consider that other providers funds have performed better. But I dont approach
his complaint about Phoenix Life from that perspective. What Im considering is if Phoenix
Life has kept to its side of its contract with Mr R, if it has treated Mr R fairly, how it has
handled his complaints and queries and if it has administered Mr Rs policy efficiently,
including providing him with correct information about his policy.
Against that background Ive gone on to consider those aspects of Mr Rs complaint that
have been referred to us in time.
New Year bonuses between February 1990 and February 2003 (point 5 above)
I dont think Mr R was ever entitled to New Year bonuses. I think hes referring to annual
(sometime called reversionary) bonuses. Those and any terminal bonus are the only
bonuses which are payable. But annual and terminal bonuses arent guaranteed. The
amounts paid, if any, are at Phoenix Lifes discretion.
Annual bonuses (point 6 above)
Mr R is understandably unhappy that annual bonus rates were reduced and since 2004/2005 
no annual bonuses have been paid. But I think the reasons why thats happened have been 
explained. As Ive said above, reversionary (or annual) bonuses arent guaranteed although 
once added cant be removed or reduced (provided the premiums continue to be paid and 
the policy continues to NRD).
Phoenix Life has said that no further bonuses have been added to Mr Rs policy because the
guaranteed benefits (the original sum assured and the bonuses already added) exceeds his
fair share of the with profits fund. So, in effect, the guaranteed value of his policy exceeds
the value of the premiums hes paid. That means hes already getting a fair return on his
investment, without further bonuses being added. If further bonuses were added to his
policy that would be to the detriment of the other with profits investors and wouldnt be fair on
them, given that Mr R is already getting a fair share of the with profits fund, based on the
premiums hes paid and investment returns on the with profits fund.
Was the policy appropriate for Mr R?
Retirement annuity contracts were available to the self employed and to those who werent a
member of an occupational pension scheme. Since 6 April 1988 it hasnt been possible totake out a new retirement annuity contract (they were replaced by personal pensions) but
those taken out before that date remain in place, subject to any overriding legislative
changes.
In 1985 when he took the policy out Mr R was self employed. He had a need to make
retirement provision and so it was appropriate for him to take out a retirement annuity
contract. Theres no suggestion that the policy was unaffordable as Mr R maintained the
premiums throughout.
The with profits fund wouldve been considered suitable for a cautious investor. There was
nothing to suggest Mr R wanted to take a higher level of risk.
Conflicting information about Mr Rs fund value
From what Ive seen the statements issued up to Mr Rs NRD in August 2018 were
consistent and showed the correct fund value  £37,346.90. That was made up of the
guaranteed sum assured of £15,619 plus bonuses of £21,727.90. I havent seen any
statements which indicated a value of £39,000 or more.
For example, the annual statement as at 5 February 2017 showed an assumed pension start
date in August 2018 and a guaranteed pension fund then of £37,346.90. That was made up
of the sum assured of £15,619 plus total permanent bonuses of £21,727.90. Thats
consistent with the annual statement for the following year dated 5 February 2018.
Phoenix Lifes countdown to retirement letter dated 27 May 2018 showed estimated
pension savings of £37,191.58. A further retirement quotation dated 30 July 2018 showed
estimated pension savings of £37,346.90. Thats again as expected. I think the slight dip in
the earlier quotation reflects the fact that further premiums were due up to NRD at the time
the quotation was issued.
Things may have got confused after Mr R passed his NRD. I think statements were at first
issued on the basis that hed continue to pay his premiums. That means that the sum
assured increased. In its letter of 18 October 2019 Phoenix Life said the sum assured
increased to £19,937.
Phoenix Life went on to say that the total annual bonus remained at £27,614.50 giving a
guaranteed fund value in August 2023 of £47,551.50. But, from what Ive seen, the total
annual bonus figure was only £21,727.90. Phoenix Lifes earlier, 12 February 2019, letter
had also quoted the same figures and the higher total bonus amount. The higher annual
bonus figure (£27,614.50) was also used in calculating the lower guaranteed fund that would
be available in August 2023 if no further premiums were paid. The revised figure of
£44,929.50 was based on a higher sum assured of £17,315 plus total annual bonuses of
£27,614.50 (and not £21,727.90).
Although I can understand why the sum assured will have increased, I dont see why the
total annual bonus figure has changed. Id ask Phoenix Life, in response to this provisional
decision, to clarify the figures and which annual bonus figure applies and why.
More recently heres been further confusion. As I said above, Mr R told us that, according to
statements hed received, the value of his policy had fallen to £26,131.67.
The annual statement dated 5 February 2020, based on an assumed pension start date in
August 2023, showed a guaranteed pension fund as at that date of £26,131.67. That was
made up of the basic guaranteed benefit of the paid up plan (£16,864) plus permanent
bonuses added to the plan (£9,267.67), making a total of £26,131.67. Although theguaranteed sum assured had been adjusted upwards (from £15,619 to £16,864) the
bonuses had been reduced (from £27,614.50 or £21,727.90) to £9,267.67. The same figures
(£16,864 and £9,267.67) were shown on the annual statement dated February 2021.
Phoenix Life has said that was wrong and has issued a revised statement (and apologised
for the error and the time taken to correct it). The revised statement shows an assumed
pension date in August 2023. And a guaranteed pension fund as at that date of £44,839.50.
Thats made up of the sum assured of £17,225 and total permanent bonuses of £27,614.50.
Im sure that Mr R will have been relieved to see that his policy hadnt fallen in value to
£26,131.67. But although its much closer to the earlier quoted figure of £44,929.50, the
figure isnt the same and is slightly lower. Im not sure why that is. Id ask Phoenix Life to
explain the discrepancy in response to this provisional decision.
And the revised statement is also issued on the basis that the policy has acquired total
annual bonuses of £27,614.50. As Ive said, Im not sure thats correct. So again, Id ask
Phoenix Life to clarify the position and confirm whether the revised statement is itself correct.
Issuing statements which were wrong and which showed a significant fall in value of the
policy will have upset and worried Mr R, particularly against the background of his complaint.
And will no doubt have further his confidence in Phoenix Life. I dont know how it came about
that an incorrect statement came to be issued. But I think Phoenix Life should pay some
compensation to Mr R for the upset and worry the 2020 and 2021 incorrect statements will
have caused him. I think Phoenix Life should pay £200 to Mr R.
Ive taken into account that the statement was issued during the period when Mr Rs
complaint was being looked into and against the background of his general unhappiness
with his policy. I think Phoenix Life shouldve taken more care (even if the statement was
automatically generated) to ensure that information issued to Mr R was correct.
Ive also borne in mind that Mr R has already received some compensation from Phoenix
Life. From what Ive seen I think that amounted in total to £300. I think a further £200 is
merited. Thats on the basis that revised statement Phoenix Life has recently issued is
correct and that the bonus figures shown in that statement and the earlier statements and
letters is correct. If that isnt the case a further award could be justified.
Unanswered queries in Mr Rs letter of 6 July 2019
Phoenix Life has now dealt with those questions. I dont have anything to add to the
explanations Phoenix Life gave, aside from perhaps to highlight what was said about Mr Rs
fair share of the fund exceeding the guaranteed value the policy has already acquired. If the
value of Mr Rs policy exceeds the asset share he holds in the underlying with profits fund, I
dont see its unfair that he isnt entitled to further bonuses. Adding further bonuses would be
unfair on other policyholders as Mr Rs share of the fund would increase further and the
shares held by other investors would reduce further. Id add that investment conditions over
the past fifteen years or so havent been as favourable as when the policy was set up and
returns over the life of the policy have been lower than anticipated.
Summary
In the main I havent upheld those aspects of Mr Rs complaint that I can consider. But the
annual statements issued in February 2020 and 2021 werent accurate and Ive made an
award for that.
Ive also asked Phoenix Life to confirm that the recently issued revised statement is accurate
and that the total bonus figures quoted on that statement and earlier is correct too.I note that Phoenix Life also sent a further letter to Mr R on 30 June 2020 claiming
outstanding payments totalling £839.09 due from August 2018, representing missed
premium payments from August 2018.
That goes back to the problem that arose in September 2018 when, because Mr R didnt
take his benefits at his NRD, the policy was automatically extended to age 75. But Phoenix
Life didnt tell Mr R that or that premiums would continue to be collected. Phoenix Life later
clarified with Mr R that he didnt want to continue to pay premiums. And I think the two
payments that were made have now been refunded to Mr R.
Im not sure how it came about that, well over a year later, a further arrears letter came to be
issued. I think Phoenix Lifes systems should have been amended in 2018/2019 to show that
further premiums werent due so that Mr R wouldnt receive any further letters asking for
payments.
The investigator said she hadnt investigated this aspect of the matter. I think that was
because it was a new complaint and Phoenix Life hadnt been able to investigate it. I think
thats technically right. But I dont think much would be gained by treating it as a fresh
complaint. I think it would be in both parties interests to include it as part of Mr Rs current
complaint.
I cant see that the letter should have been sent. By June 2020 Phoenix Lifes records
shouldve shown that that Mr R wouldnt be making further premium payments. I think
Phoenix Life should pay Mr R a further £50 for any distress or inconvenience its letter of 30
June 2020 caused.
So, as things stand, Im making an award of, in total, £250.
My provisional decision
Im upholding Mr Rs complaint but only in part. Based on what Ive seen so far, Phoenix Life
Assurance Limited should pay him £250 for the distress and inconvenience resulting from
the failings Ive identified above  sending Mr R incorrect statements in 2020 and 2021 and
an arrears letter on 30 June 2020.
Responses to my provisional decision
Phoenix Life said that the reason for the difference in values from £44,929.50 and 
£44,839.50 was because Mr R had two premiums refunded, making the paid up date August 
2018 and not October 2018. That made a difference (£90) to the sum assured - from 
£17,315 to £17,225. 
Phoenix Life confirmed that the figures in the revised statement are correct. 
About the further compensation of £250, Phoenix Life said both issues had occurred after 
the complaint had been referred to us. Phoenix was happy to pay the additional amount but 
said it hadnt had the opportunity to investigate the new points and so it would be unfair to 
say that wed reached a different conclusion to Phoenix Lifes initial decision not to uphold 
the complaint, which was the same conclusion as the investigator reached. Phoenix Life 
however agreed that not much would be gained by treating the further matters as a new 
complaint. 
Mr R raised a number of queries as follows: 
Were we saying that Phoenix Life had invested his money correctly?What was the actual (correct) value of his pension fund?
His pension was supposed to be paid when he reached age 70. He asked when hed 
get his pension, if it would be backdated to 2018 and if interest or compensation for 
loss of income would be paid. 
He added that Phoenix Life had told him the reason he didnt get an annual bonus was so 
that funds could be built up so hed get a terminal bonus.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ill deal first with the points Mr R has raised in response to my provisional decision. 
As to whether Phoenix Life has invested his money correctly, Mr Rs contributions have been 
invested in Phoenix Lifes with profits fund in accordance with the investment instruction he 
gave when he set up the policy. As to how his money has actually been invested, the with 
profits fund is a pooled investment and Mr Rs contributions are combined with those of other 
investors and invested in a mix of assets. 
Phoenix Life is accountable to the regulator for the way in which it operates its with profits 
fund (in accordance with its PPFM). The regulator monitors the management of with profits 
funds. Businesses are required to appoint a with-profits actuary and the regulator provides 
rules and guidance on their duties. As I said in my provisional decision, Phoenix Life also 
has an independent With Profits Committee, whose remit is to protect the interests of the 
with profits policyholders and ensure that they are treated fairly. Im not aware that the FCA 
has any concerns about Phoenix Life runs its with profits fund or about how certain 
policyholders may have been treated. Against that background, I dont think theres anything 
to suggest that Mr Rs money hasnt been invested correctly. 
I acknowledge that, because of the non payment of annual and terminal bonuses, Mr R may 
feel differently. But the payment of bonuses is discretionary and Ive explained in my 
provisional decision why, given that investment conditions havent been as anticipated, 
bonuses have been scaled back. Thats impacted particularly on investors such as Mr R who 
has an entitlement to a guaranteed sum which isnt dependent on how the underlying fund 
performs. 
I accept that Mr R may well have been told that annual bonuses had stopped so that funds 
could be built up to pay terminal bonuses But the point remains that, if the value of his 
guaranteed benefits exceeds his policys fair share of the fund, no bonuses will be paid. 
As to the correct and actual value of his pension fund, Phoenix Life has confirmed that the 
figures in the revised statement it issued are correct. Im assuming thats the statement 
Phoenix Life sent Mr R undercover of its letter of 28 September 2021. That showed an 
assumed pension date of Mr Rs 75th birthday in August 2023 and a guaranteed pension 
fund of £44,839.50, made up of the sum assured of £17,225. 
Those figures are based on Mr R not taking benefits from his policy until he reaches age 75. 
If he takes his benefits earlier the amounts will change. I note what hes said about wanting 
to take benefits. And that he wanted to take his benefits at age 70. That was his original 
NRD. As Phoenix Life explained in its letter of 11 December 2018, the policy was 
automatically deferred to age 75. Albeit that Phoenix Life failed to tell Mr R at the time that 
would happen and that, unless the policy was made paid up, premiums would continue to be 
collected. Thats since been sorted out and the two further premiums refunded. If Mr R now wants to take his benefits, hell need to tell Phoenix Life thats what he wants to 
do. And if he considers his benefits shouldve been paid from age 70, hell need to explore 
that possibility and if payments can be backdated with Phoenix Life. 
Phoenix Life has expressed some unhappiness that, as part of Mr Rs current complaint, Ive 
dealt with some issues that arose after his complaint had been referred to us. It is 
sometimes the case that further issues arise during the course of our investigation. In some 
circumstances well treat them as new complaints. But we wont always do that.   
Here there are two points. First that Phoenix Life sent statements to Mr R in February 2020 
and February 2021 which appeared to show that his fund value had reduced to £26,131.67 
(made up of a sum assured of £16,864 plus bonuses of £9,267.17, which was a reduction 
from the previously quoted bonus figure). Secondly, Mr R had received a letter from Phoenix 
Life dated 30 June 2020 claiming arrears of premium payments when his policy had been 
made paid up from August 2018. In my provisional decision I proposed to award £200 for the 
incorrect statements and £50 for the letter sent on 30 June 2020. 
I dont agree that Phoenix Life didnt have any chance to investigate what had happened, at 
least in so far as the incorrect statements were concerned. We emailed Phoenix Life 
querying those statements on 16 August 2021. Phoenix Life replied on 14 October 2021 with 
a copy of the revised statement it had sent to Mr R (and to which Ive referred above). So 
Phoenix had ample time to investigate before acknowledging that the statements were 
incorrect and issuing a revised statement. 
And, had Phoenix Life wanted to dispute that any letter was sent to Mr R on 30 June 2020 
claiming arrears which werent in fact due, it could have raised any issues in response to my 
provisional decision. In the circumstances and as Phoenix Life has conceded that there 
would be little point in treating these further matters as a new complaint, Ive made the 
award I proposed in my provisional decision below. 
All in all, my views remain as set out in my provisional decision and recapped above.   
My final decision
Im upholding Mr Rs complaint but only in part. Phoenix Life Assurance Limited should pay 
him £250 for the distress and inconvenience resulting from the failings Ive identified above  
sending Mr R incorrect statements in 2020 and 2021 and an arrears letter on 30 June 2020.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 December 2021.
