The complaint
Mr R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) hasnt done enough to 
protect him against the loss of money to a scam.
What happened
Mr R says that in 2017 he saw and advert for a trading platform that I will call B. He say a 
friend had used it successfully. He subsequently signed up with it and opened an account. 
Once this account was opened he made three payments totalling £6,500 to B. These were a 
transaction of £500 on 8 February 2018, £1,000 on 12 February 2018 and £5,000 on 19 
February 2018.
Some months later after failing to be able to withdraw his funds from B and being told that 
his investments were now worthless Mr R discovered that he had been scammed.  Mr R 
reported to NatWest that hed been scammed in 2022 via his representative. NatWest 
declined to refund Mr Rs transactions. Mr R remaining unhappy, referred his complaint 
about NatWest to us. Our investigator did not recommend that NatWest refund the 
transactions. Mr R did not agree with this outcome and therefore the case has been passed 
to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I dont think NatWest could reasonably be expected to have prevented the payments Mr R
says he lost to a scam. This is because at the time generally, banks were expected to
process payments a customer authorised it to make. And under The Payment Services
Regulations and terms and conditions of the account, Mr R is presumed liable for the loss in
the first instance, in circumstances where he authorised the payment. That said, as a matter
of good industry practice, NatWest should have taken proactive steps to identify and help
prevent transactions  particularly unusual or uncharacteristic transactions  that could
involve fraud or be the result of a scam. However, there is a balance to be struck: banks had
(and have) obligations to be alert to fraud and scams and to act in their customers best
interests, but they cant reasonably be involved in every transaction.
I can see that at the time of the transactions Mr R had received a large amount of money 
and had made several large purchases and transfers. In this context the payments to B 
would not stand out sufficiently for me to conclude that NatWest should have intervened 
when they were made. I also note that the FCA warning about B does not seem to have 
been issued until 23 February 2018 so I dont think that NatWest should have been on notice 
about payments to B.
This means that as NatWest didnt interact with Mr R at the time of the payments  and Ive
concluded that I cant reasonably say NatWest ought to have been obliged to have gotten in
touch with Mr R about them  Im satisfied NatWest didnt unreasonably miss an opportunity 
to prevent the payments before they were sent.
After the payment was made, I wouldnt reasonably expect NatWest to have done anything
further until Mr R notified it hed been scammed. Then, because they were debit card
payments, the only recourse for potential recovery of the payments would be via the
chargeback scheme. 
Given the timescales involved I dont think that NatWest could have attempted a chargeback 
for these transactions, so I dont think NatWest did anything wrong in relation to this.
Overall I have great sympathy for Mr R and I understand that this will be really disappointing 
for him. But I can only recommend NatWest refund the transactions if I think it did anything 
wrong and for the reasons above I dont think that it did.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 May 2023.
