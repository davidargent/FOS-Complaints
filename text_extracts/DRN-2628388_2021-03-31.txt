The complaint
Mr and Mrs W complain about the link National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) made 
between Mr W and another individual with the same name and date of birth.
What happened
Sometime between 2013 and 2014, Mr and Mrs W became aware that NatWest had created 
a link on its system between Mr W and another individual with the same first name, surname 
and date of birth. This led to various issues, including Mr W being chased for outstanding 
debts linked to the other individual. After some back and forth, in 2014 NatWest confirmed 
that the error had been rectified, and paid Mr W £1,350 compensation.
In the years following this, Mr W received more letters chasing outstanding debts and 
experienced issues obtaining credit. Most recently, in 2020, NatWest declined 
Mr and Mrs Ws mortgage application. So, they complained to NatWest.
NatWest reviewed things and said the mortgage was declined because of a link on its 
system between Mr W and the other individual. NatWest told Mr and Mrs W the link had 
been removed and paid them a total of £500 in compensation.
Mr and Mrs W didnt think NatWests review properly addressed the impact the matter has 
had on them. Mr W also submitted a Data Subject Access Request to NatWest and found 
mention of the other individual, despite being told all links had been removed. So, 
Mr and Mrs W brought their complaint to our service. 
One of our investigators reviewed matters and thought NatWest had since successfully 
removed the link. But she thought more could be done to recognise the impact on 
Mr and Mrs W. Given that Mr and Mrs W said they both pay for credit reports to keep an eye 
on matters, our investigator thought it would be fair for NatWest to cover these costs for a 
period of 12 months.
NatWest didnt dispute our investigators findings, but Mr and Mrs W did. They pointed out 
NatWest had previously assured them matters were fixed, only to find that the same issue 
reoccurred. They also said NatWest werent clear about whether they could raise further 
complaints, linked to the existing complaint, should the issues arise again.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, the case has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I think the complaint should be upheld. Ill explain my reasons why. 
Although a number of issues have been raised, this decision only addresses those issues 
I consider to be materially relevant to this complaint. However, Ive given careful 
consideration to all of the submissions made before arriving at my decision.
Mr and Mrs W describe in detail the impact on them resulting from the initial mistake 
NatWest made. Amongst other things, they explain that Mr W was declined for credit and 
was chased for outstanding debts relating to the other individual. Understandably, this 
wouldve caused Mr and Mrs W considerable worry and distress. 
As I understand it, NatWest took steps to remove the link between the two individuals in 
2014. Additionally, it gave Mr W a letter explaining the mistake that had been made, which 
he could share with other companies if he continued to be chased for debts. It also paid 
Mr W a total of £1,350 compensation. Having considered the overall circumstances, I think 
NatWests offer of compensation was fair. I also think NatWests assurance around 
preventing further mistakes was appropriate at the time.
Unfortunately, there appeared to still be issues in the years following this. For example, 
Mr W received letters from third parties pursuing outstanding debts linked to the other 
individual. As I understand it, Mr W dealt with each of these issues directly with the 
companies as they arose.
More recently, the link to the other individual resulted in Mr and Mrs Ws mortgage 
application being declined. Understandably, this wouldve caused them worry and upset, 
particularly as they were told the link had been removed some time ago. In response to 
these concerns, NatWest updated its records to reflect accurate information. This took 
around a week, and Mr and Mrs W were then able to continue with their mortgage 
application. Having thought about this carefully, I think NatWest was able to rectify the 
situation relatively quickly. 
In its submissions to this service, NatWest also provided an internal screenshot of Mr Ws 
account, which has no mention of the other individual. With this in mind, and considering that 
the mortgage application was able to complete successfully shortly afterwards, Im satisfied 
that NatWest has taken the necessary steps to remove the link between both parties. 
NatWest cant give Mr and Mrs W solid reassurance that this issue wont happen again. But, 
on our investigators recommendation, has agreed to fund Mr and Mrs Ws subscriptions to 
credit reports for 12 months, so Mr and Mrs W can keep a close eye on matters. This is a 
total of £551.76, which is in addition to the £500 compensation its already paid for the 
issues that arose in 2020. Considering the circumstances, I think this is a fair 
recommendation.
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay Mr W £551.76 to cover 
12 months worth of credit report subscriptions, for both Mr and Mrs W.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs W to 
accept or reject my decision before 28 April 2021.
