The complaint
Mr M complains that Monzo Bank Ltd (Monzo) wont refund money he lost as the result of a 
scam.
What happened
In 2021, Mr M was contacted online by someone who Ill refer to as C. C offered Mr M a way 
to increase his income by investing through a company Ill refer to as E. Mr M invested and 
after his initial trades, was told that his investment had generated a £1,600 profit. Mr M 
wanted to withdraw the funds but was told he had to invest a further £5,000 within a week or 
he would lose everything. Mr M says that each week C pressured him to invest more money.
 
Ultimately, when Mr M didnt have any more money to invest, he showed the investment 
platform to a friend who told him it was a scam.
In February 2022, Mr M reported the scam to Monzo and asked them to refund him.
Monzo declined to refund Mr M saying he hadnt done enough checks. But they contacted 
the beneficiary banks and were able to recover £1,589.22, which they paid to Mr M.
In June 2022, Mr M was contacted by a company Ill refer to as R. R said they were a law 
firm and could help him get back the money hed lost as part of the investment scam. Mr M 
was asked to pay their legal fees upfront, and he made a payment of £2,350. Unfortunately, 
this was also a scam.
Mr M reported the second scam to Monzo and asked them to refund him. Monzo declined to 
refund Mr M saying he hadnt done enough checks on R and their legitimacy. Monzo tried to 
recover Mr Ms funds, but no funds remained.
Mr M wasnt happy with Monzos response, so he brought a complaint to our service.
Below is a list of the payments that Mr M made as part of both scams.

An investigator looked in Mr Ms complaint and partially upheld it, recommending that Monzo 
refund 50% of the payments that Mr M had made and pay interest on that refund.
Monzo disagreed with the investigators recommendation and asked for the case to be 
reviewed by an ombudsman. 
Having reviewed the case, I found additional payments that the investigator hadnt included 
as part of their investigation. Also, while I intended to reach the same overall outcome as the 
investigator, I was making a slightly different redress recommendation and had reached my 
answer for slightly different reasons. So, I wrote to both parties, letting them know my 
thoughts and giving them the opportunity to respond before I issued a final decision.
Mr M accepted my recommendation, however Monzo didnt respond. As the deadline has 
now expired, I have proceeded with issuing my final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Due to these scams happening a few months apart and involving two separate scam 
scenarios  Ive considered the payments relating to each scam separately.
The payments involved in scam 1 (payments 1 to 20)
From what I've seen all of the payments made as part of the first scam, except for the 
payments to the money transfer service made on 31 December 2021 and 20 January 2022, 
are faster payments and are covered by the Lending Standards Boards Contingent 
Reimbursement Model Code (the CRM Code). The two payments made to the money 
transfer service are card payments, which wouldnt be covered by the CRM Code.
However, having considered the size of the first payment Mr M made being £5,000 and 
comparing it to his previous account use, Im satisfied that it was so unusual and out of 
character that Monzo shouldve identified a scam risk and intervened by discussing the 
payment with Mr M  rather than relying on providing an effective warning as set out in the 
CRM Code. This intervention couldve been a call or contact through an in-app chat function. 
If Monzo had intervened, I think simple questioning about why Mr M was making the 
payment, what he knew about C and how he met them wouldve uncovered the scam and his loss would've been prevented. I say this because Mr M was taking investment advice 
from someone he had recently met online, hadnt met in person, and hadnt carried out any 
checks on. All of the information that Mr M wouldve given Monzo wouldve matched with the 
common signs of an investment scam. On that basis, Im persuaded that intervention by 
Monzo wouldve uncovered the scam and prevented Mr M from making any of the payments 
that were made as part of scam 1  preventing Mr Ms loss. Therefore, Monzo should refund 
Mr M for all of the payments he made as part of scam 1. 
However, Ive also considered whether Mr M should share responsibility for his loss. 
Having carefully considered the information, Im satisfied that Mr M is partly to blame for his 
loss by not taking reasonable steps to ensure the investment opportunity was genuine. I say 
this because:
While Mr M did checks on the investment company E, he didnt research C who was 
telling him to invest, Cs qualifications or their links to E.
The app that he downloaded in order to trade isn't directly linked to E, whom he 
thought he was investing through.
I think Mr M should've been concerned that the returns he was promised were too 
good to be true.
Mr M believed that he was investing with or through E but has no paperwork or other 
documentation that I would expect to see relating to an investment or trading 
account.
There is no reasonable explanation for why Mr M would be making payments to 
multiple different individuals who have no links to C or E.
I think there were enough warning signs that Mr M should've been concerned about the 
legitimacy of the investment opportunity. Especially considering he was taking advice from 
someone hed very recently met online. So, I think he should share his loss with Monzo and 
they should only refund 50% of the payments he made as part of scam one.
The funds that Monzo recovered from the beneficiary banks relate to payments made as part 
of scam one, payments 1 to 20. These recovered funds should be deducted from the total of 
the payments made as part of scam one, with Monzo refunding 50% of the remaining 
outstanding loss.
The payment made as part of scam 2 (payment 21)
Monzo have declined to refund this payment under the CRM Code, saying that Mr M didnt 
have a reasonable basis for believing that the firm who contacted him was legitimate. I agree 
that Monzo can rely on an exception to reimbursement for this payment.
In this scam, Mr M was told R could recover the funds that hed lost to the investment scam. 
However, by this point Mr M was aware that the investment funds were lost as part of a 
scam, and I havent seen anything that would suggest how a genuine firm would be able to 
get funds back from a scammer. 
Also, there is no paperwork that shows what R was offering to do, what costs were involved, 
or how they would recover this money. I also havent seen anything to show what checks   
Mr M did on R to check their legitimacy. And, based on the information that he had, I think 
there were enough warning signs that he shouldve been concerned and completed checks 
to satisfy himself they were legitimate.
For this payment, Monzo werent required to give an effective warning under the CRM Code, 
based on the specifics of the payment including its size, the previous account use and that it was a single payment. And, unlike the first payment made as part of scam one, I wouldnt 
have expected Monzo to identify a scam risk or to intervene before processing this payment.
On that basis, I cant fairly ask Monzo to refund Mr M for this payment.
Putting things right
To put things right Monzo Bank Ltd should:
Refund 50% of Mr Ms outstanding loss in relation to the payments made as part of 
scam one.
Pay interest on that refund at 8% simple interest per year, from the date the 
transactions were made until the date of settlement*.
*If Monzo considers that its required by HM Revenue & Customs to deduct income tax from 
that interest, it should tell Mr M how much its taken off. It should also give Mr M a tax 
deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold this complaint against Monzo Bank Ltd and require 
them to compensate Mr M as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 November 2023.
