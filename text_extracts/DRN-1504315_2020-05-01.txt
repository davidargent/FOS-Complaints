The complaint
Mrs S complains that Santander UK Plc sent a text message about her credit card balance 
in the middle of the night. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Santander is free to decide how its text alert system operates, including when to 
send them. Santander says the information contained in its text to Mrs S was 
important and sent to ensure she was aware of the account balance.
Santander has confirmed that it cant change the time it sends out information of this 
nature. 
Santanders final response apologised for disturbing Mrs S and it paid her £20. Im 
satisfied that £20 fairly reflects the impact of receiving Santanders text message 
during the night. 
I havent found that Santander made an error and Im satisfied it dealt with Mrs S' 
complaint fairly. As a result, Im not telling Santander to take any further action. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 May 2020.
