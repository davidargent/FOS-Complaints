K821x#15complaint
Mr F complains about the short term loans  he took out with CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as 
QuickQuid. Mr F says that he rolled  over the loans many times and he also increased the 
amount he borrowed.  This was because he couldnt  properly  afford  the repayments. He 
thinks QuickQuid shouldve noticed this and not lent to him. 
background
Mr F took out 14 loans  between April 2009 and November 2013. Some of the information 
QuickQuid has given  us is shown in the table below:

QuickQuid looked  at Mr Fs initial complaint and said that it should be partially upheld.  It said 
that it did appropriate checks for loans 1 to 14. And these checks showed that the lending 
was affordable. However it thought  that it was clear  Mr F was dependent on short  term 
lending by loan 10. So it offered to refund the interest and charges, plus interest, applied to 
this loan to settle  the complaint. Mr F didnt accept this offer and brought his complaint to the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service.  
QuickQuid didnt think that the Financial  Ombudsman Service should  look at loans  1 to 8 as 
it thought Mr F had made his complaint about  these  loans too late. After some 
correspondence Mr F withdrew his complaint about these loans. So Ill only look at loans 9 to 
14 in this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at what Mr F and QuickQuid said.  She thought  Mr Fs 
complaint should  be partially upheld. She didnt think that QuickQuid had made  
proportionate checks for loans  9 to 14. She thought if it had then it wouldnt have agreed to 
lend Mr F money at these  times. This is because she didnt  think  that Mr F could afford the 
repayments. And QuickQuid wouldve seen this had it completed better checks. She agreed  
with QuickQuids offer to settle loan 10.
Ref: DRN60432482QuickQuid didnt agree with our adjudicator. It said that: 
it did proportionate checks for before approving all of the loans; and
Mr Fs gambling  wasnt relevant  as it wouldnt be a matter of public record and the loan 
repayments would take precedence over it
But after some further correspondence it agreed  that it lent irresponsibly for loans 9 to 14. It 
offered to refund all the fees and charges on loans 9 to 13 and some of the fees and 
charges applied to loan 14 (from  May 2014  onwards). 
Mr F didnt  accept this offer; he thought he should receive compensation for all of loan 14. 
So as no agreements been reached  the complaints been passed to me to me to issue  a 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Having done so, Ive decided to partially  uphold Mr Fs complaint. Having reviewed the 
evidence I have available I think QuickQuid was wrong to have  given Mr F loans 9 to 14. Ill 
explain why.
QuickQuid has made  on offer to settle  loans  9 to 13. It has also made  a partial  offer to settle 
loan 14. QuickQuid has agreed  that it shouldve recognised that Mr F was in financial 
difficulty and that his pattern of lending shows that he mayve been  dependent  on short  term 
lending. So the only remaining disagreement is whether all of loan 14 should be upheld. Ive 
only looked at this issue in my decision.  
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether the consumer will be able to repay what theyre borrowing in a sustainable manner. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. The lending  shouldnt adversely impact a consumers financial situation.  
The guidance and rules themselves didnt set out compulsory  checks.  But they are clear that 
any checks needed to be proportionate and could take into account a number of different 
things. This could include how much was being  lent, the size of the repayments  and what  the 
lender found out about the consumer. 
By loan 14 I think that it wouldve been proportionate  to find out about Mr Fs normal monthly 
living costs  and financial commitments including any existing short-term lending.  And I think 
that QuickQuid needed  to verify this information  to get an accurate picture of Mr Fs 
finances. This is to make  sure Mr F was in position to make  the repayments  sustainably.
I dont think QuickQuid did this. Ive seen no persuasive evidence  that it reviewed Mr Fs 
situation in full. And it agrees that it didnt do enough  before approving  loans 9 to 14. So 
I need to think  about  what QuickQuid wouldve seen  if it had carried out proportionate 
checks. 
Ref: DRN60432483Mr F has provided  some information about his financial  circumstances such  as his bank  
statements. I accept that this isnt exactly what QuickQuid wouldve seen at the time.  But 
I think it wouldve found out similar information  if it had made proportionate checks, so I think  
its reasonable to rely on it.
This shows that Mr F earned around  £2,000 in the months before QuickQuid approved  loan 
14. His regular  expenditure  was around £1,500.  
But Mr F was in significant financial difficulty. In the months before loan 14, Mr F borrowed 
and repaid large amounts  to other  payday lenders. Sometimes this was over £1,000. So he 
was already spending more than his disposable  income, before he needed to make the 
repayments to QuickQuid. 
And I think proportionate  checks wouldve also shown QuickQuid that a substantial  portion of 
Mr Fs income  was going on gambling.  I think that if QuickQuid had seen  this, it wouldnt 
have thought it was responsible to lend to Mr F because of this.
And QuickQuid agrees  that Mr F was dependent on short term lending. I note loan 14 is a 
flex credit arrangement  which is different from the payday loans that came before it. But Mr F 
had been borrowing significant amounts from QuickQuid for over 4 years  at this point. I dont 
see how this further loan isnt evidence of a continuing dependency  on short term credit.  
I think that QuickQuid wouldve found  out this information if it had made  proportionate  
checks. And I think QuickQuid wouldve seen Mr F wouldnt have been able repay the loans 
in a sustainable way. I think that QuickQuid shouldnt have given loans 9 to 14 to Mr F and 
I think hes lost out as a result of this. So I think Mr F should  be paid compensation in 
respect of loans 9 to 14.
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
To put things right for Mr F, QuickQuid should:
update and pay the offer it has made to refund all interest and charges in respect of loan 
9 to 13; and 
refund  all the interest and charges applied as a result of loan 14; and
add interest at 8% per year simple on the above interest  and charges from the date they 
were paid,  if they were,  to the date of settlement; and
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Fs credit file about  these  loans;
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr F a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Fs complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 February  2019.
