The complaint
Ms M complains that Gain Credit LLC trading as Lending Stream lent to her irresponsibly. 
What happened
Ms M was given 12 loans by Gain Credit between January 2017 and August 2019. All the 
loans were short-term instalment loans, to be repaid over 6 months. The amount borrowed 
ranged from £250 to £850.
As the table below shows, some of these loans ran concurrently. I understand all of the 
loans are closed. 
A summary of Ms M's borrowing is as follows:

1 10/01/2017 04/05/2017 6 £300.00
2 06/10/2017 05/11/2017 6 £650.00
3 28/11/2017 17/02/2018 6 £350.00

Ms M's complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He thought that Gain 
Credit shouldnt have provided loans 7 to 12 and he asked Gain Credit to pay Ms M some 
compensation. Gain Credit didn't agree with that assessment. So the complaint has been 
passed to me to resolve the matter.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Gain Credit needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. This 
means that it had to carry out proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Ms M could repay the 
loans in a sustainable way. Gain Credit's checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. 
But I've also considered if there were any other factors that might indicate that Gain Credit 
should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish whether the lending was 
sustainable for Ms M.
 Such factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,  
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. 
Ive carefully considered all the evidence, arguments and information Ive seen about this 
matter and what it means for Ms M. 
Ms Ms loans were all repayable over 6 months. So, the amounts that she needed to repay 
each month were smaller than if shed taken a traditional payday loan where the principal 
and interest is repaid on or around the next payday. But she had to make those repayments 
over a longer timeframe. So Ive considered the total amount that Ms M needed to repay to 
Gain Credit every month, and the period over which these payments had to be sustained.
Ms M took the loans over a period of about 20 months, but there was a gap of about 5 
months between Ms M repaying the first loan and then taking the second loan. Given the 
length of this gap and the fact it occurred so early in the lending relationship, I think Gain 
Credit might reasonably have considered that any problems that had led Ms M to take the 
first loan had now been resolved. I think the gap represented a clean break in lending. So 
when Ms M took her second loan, I think it was reasonable for Gain Credit to treat her as it 
would a new customer, as this was the start of the second chain of lending. 
Gain Credit carried out some checks before it gave each loan to Ms M. This included asking 
Ms M for details of her income and expenditure and gathering information from credit 
reference agencies. 
I think that the checks Gain Credit did before agreeing the first loan were reasonable and 
proportionate, given the amount it was lending to Ms M, in comparison with her income, what 
Ms M had told Gain Credit about her circumstances and the length of the lending 
relationship. I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for Gain Credit to ask Ms M for the 
amount of information that would be needed to show the lending was unsustainable before 
agreeing the first loan. So I am not upholding the complaint about this loan.
As Ive explained, I think there was a clear break in the lending after loan one. So I think it was reasonable for Gain Credit to treat Ms M as it would a new customer, when she applied 
for her second loan.  Overall, I think that the checks Gain Credit did before agreeing loans 2 
to 4 were also reasonable and proportionate. Ms M increased her borrowing when she took 
the second loan. And she took her fourth loan before she had repaid her loan 3. But this was 
still a relatively early stage in the lending relationship and given what Ms M had told Gain 
Credit about her financial position, I think the lender might reasonably have concluded that it 
was still appropriate to provide loans 2 to 4 because they appeared affordable. So I am not 
upholding Ms Ms complaint about these loans.
I do think Gain Credit should have carried out more thorough checks before agreeing to 
loans 5 and 6  given the significant increase in Ms Ms borrowing and the number of 
consecutive loans taken over time. But based on the evidence presented, I cannot say better 
checks by Gain Credit would have shown at the time that these loans were unaffordable or 
unsustainable.  So I cant fairly say that Gain Credit would reasonably have concluded that it 
shouldnt continue lending to Ms M at this point. So I am not upholding the complaint about 
loans 5 and 6.
By loan 7, I think that Ms Ms overall pattern of borrowing suggested shed become 
persistently reliant on Gain Credits lending. Ms M increased her lending again, to £650  the 
second highest amount to date. This was Ms Ms sixth consecutive loan application (in this 
chain of lending) in around eight months. Her borrowing hadnt significantly or consistently 
reduced. She had repeatedly borrowed and rapidly repaid her loans, only to return and 
borrow again shortly afterwards. I think this ought reasonably to have suggested to Gain 
Credit that Ms M was borrowing further to manage the gaps in her finances created when 
she repaid previous loans. Gain Credit ought reasonably have concluded that it was not 
appropriate to provide loan 7 to Ms C or, given the overall pattern of borrowing, to lend any 
further to her.
Gain Credit has told us it thinks the checks it carried out showed that the loans were 
affordable for Ms M. And that her overall credit obligations did not materially increase or 
reduce during the lending relationship. Gain Credit also disagrees that the pattern of lending 
had become unsustainable for Ms M. And it says Ms Ms bank statements, which it 
requested prior to agreeing to loan 12, showed that Ms M had sufficient disposable income 
to afford the payments due for that loan  so therefore she could manage the repayments 
sustainably. 
Ive thought carefully about what Gain Credit has said. But I think it should reasonably have 
realised that by the seventh loan, Ms M was no longer borrowing to meet a short-term, 
emergency need, but that she was most likely now borrowing to keep up with her ongoing 
financial commitments. And that it was not appropriate to lend any further to her. Given how 
long Ms C had been indebted and the pattern of lending, it doesnt really matter whether the 
lender believed the loans were technically affordable on a pounds and pence basis or not. 
Gain Credit was required to establish whether Ms M could sustainably repay her loan  over 
the full term of the loan, not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation. Gain Credit was effectively prolonging Ms Ms indebtedness, 
by allowing her to take expensive credit over an extended period.  I think that by offering one 
loan after another, over a prolonged period, the overall effect was likely to increase Ms Ms 
indebtedness in an unsustainable manner. I think Gain Credit should have reasonably 
questioned whether it should continue to offer short-term loans to this consumer, whose 
repeated borrowing suggested that she had become reliant on the lending - which the rules 
and guidance made clear should only be for a short-term purpose, and not for long term 
financial problems.
So in conclusion, I don't think Gain Credit should have agreed to provide Ms M with loans 7 
to 12. Gain Credit needs to pay her some compensation.Putting things right
Gain Credit should: 
Refund any interest and charges paid by Ms M on loans 7 to 12 (that haven't already 
been refunded);
add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement. HM Revenue and Customs requires 
Gain Credit to take tax off this interest. Gain Credit must give Ms M a certificate 
showing how much tax its deducted if she asks for one; 
the number of loans taken from loans 7 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 7 to 12 should be removed from Ms 
Ms credit file.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Ms Ms complaint in part and direct Gain Credit LLC trading 
as Lending Stream to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 September 2020.
