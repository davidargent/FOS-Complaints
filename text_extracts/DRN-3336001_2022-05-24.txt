The complaint
Mr and Mrs H are unhappy with how National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) are 
reporting two defaulted accounts to their credit files.
What happened
Mr and Mrs H reached an agreement with NatWest that NatWest would no longer pursue 
them for the balances outstanding on a loan and on a credit card. However, following this 
agreement, NatWest proceeded to default the two accounts and report them as such to Mr 
and Mrs Hs credit files. Mr and Mrs H werent happy about this, so they raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Mr and Mrs Hs complaint. They confirmed that while they werent going 
to pursue Mr and Mrs H for the balances outstanding on the accounts, that it was their policy 
in such circumstances to default the accounts and to report them to the credit reference 
agencies as being defaulted.
Mr and Mrs H werent satisfied with NatWests response, so they referred their complaint to 
this service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel that 
NatWest had acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr and Mrs H in how they were 
reporting the defaults to their credit files, and so they didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr and Mrs H remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs H have described to this service the difficult ongoing personal circumstances 
that led to them asking NatWest to no longer pursue the outstanding balances on the loan 
and credit card accounts, and which NatWest took into consideration when agreeing to that 
request. And Im aware that Mr and Mrs H feel that having agreed to not pursue these 
balances, that NatWest shouldnt then report these balances as defaults on their credit files.
I can sympathise with Mr and Mrs H position and I understand why they might not want 
these defaults reported on their credit files. However, it remains the case that ultimately, Mr 
and Mrs H werent able to meet the repayment commitments required on the loan and credit 
card accounts, and because of this I dont feel that NatWest are acting unfairly by having 
defaulted these accounts or by reporting these defaults to Mr and Mrs Hs credit files.
As a credit provider, NatWest have an obligation to make accurate reports to the credit 
reference agencies, and in this instance Im satisfied that the reporting of the loan and credit 
card accounts as having defaulted to the credit reference agencies does represent an 
accurate report of what took place.  
I also feel that NatWest were clear and consistent in their communication to Mr and Mrs H 
and to their representatives that the defaulting of the accounts would take place following the 
agreement by NatWest to no longer pursue the outstanding balances. In that regard, I note a 
letter sent by NatWest on 5 November 2020 to Mr and Mrs Hs representatives at that time, 
which stated:
After careful consideration and in view of the documentation supplied, the Bank will 
no longer pursue the balance held on [Mr Hs] Loan, of joint liability with [Mr and Mrs 
Hs] Credit Card in their lifetime.
It is the Banks policy to default and cancel accounts, as Mr and Mrs are no longer 
able to maintain payments in accordance with terms of issue, a Default Notice will be 
issued. Whilst I do not expect them to remedy this default, it is however, a legal 
requirement that I offer them the opportunity to do so. Once the 21-day period 
mentioned in the Default expires, I will cancel their accounts  by issuing a further 
letter.
NatWests position here was reiterated by them in future correspondence with Mr and Mrs H, 
including in the responses to Mr and Mrs Hs complaint issued by NatWest dated 14 October 
and 18 November 2021. 
As such, Im satisfied that NatWest were clear from the outset that they whilst they would no 
longer pursue Mr and Mrs H for the outstanding balances, that they would default the 
accounts and report them as such to the credit reference agencies. Additionally, for the 
reasons explained above, Im also satisfied that its fair and reasonable for NatWest to take 
this position, and as such I wont be instructing NatWest to amend the credit file reporting as 
Mr and Mrs H would like.
Finally, I note that there appears to be disagreement within NatWest as to whether one of 
the accounts should be reported as a default with the full defaulted balance or with a zero 
balance, and I note that Mr and Mrs H have been sent emails by persons within NatWest 
which state that it should be with a zero balance, which is Mr and Mrs Hs preference.
But its at NatWests discretion here as to how they choose to report the balance in question, 
and I dont feel that it would be unfair for NatWest to choose to report it with the full defaulted 
amount  as I believe is currently the case  again, for the reasons Ive already explained. I 
also note that NatWest, in their correspondence with this service in relation to this complaint, 
have confirmed that they feel that the way the default is presently being reported is fair and 
appropriate.
As such, I wont be instructing NatWest to report the balance in question in a specific way, 
as Mr and Mrs H would like, but rather I leave it to NatWest to decide in which manner they 
choose to report this defaulted account to the credit reference agencies.
I realise that this wont be the outcome that Mr and Mrs H were wanting here, but it follows 
from all the above that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any 
further action at this time. I hope that Mr and Mrs H will understand, given what Ive 
explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision before 21 June 2022.
