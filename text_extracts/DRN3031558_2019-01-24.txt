K820x#14complaint
Mr I has complained as a Director of Company S, that WorldPay (UK) Limited (WorldPay for 
short) has treated Company S  unfairly in when  it credits  money  to Company S account.
background
Mr I says that WorldPay has treated  his company  unfairly because it changed the time it 
pays money into the company account. This led to inconvenience when he tried to pay 
suppliers. He says its treated his company unfairly and should pay compensation.
WorldPay says its treated Company S fairly  and pointed out that it notified Mr I of changes  
to the settlement process.  It offered Company S £50 as a gesture of goodwill. So it doesnt 
feel it needs to do anymore.
Mr I complained to WorldPay and it said it treated him fairly. Mr I disagrees. The adjudicator 
did not agree with Mr I. As Mr I remains unhappy  this complaint has been  passed to me for a 
decision.
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I should add here that this decision will not decide on the service that Mr I (on behalf of 
Company S) has received  from this service. The process for such complaints has been 
explained to Mr I already.
WorldPay and Mr I dont agree to some  of the key issues here.  So I can only make my 
decision based on the evidence provided to me by the parties. In short  I must  decide what is 
most likely to have happened. Or in other words, what happened on the balance  of 
probabilities.
I can see from Mr Is arguments hes very upset about these matters. And Im sorry to hear 
this. However for me to uphold this complaint I have to be persuaded that WorldPay has 
treated Mr I unfairly and that this has led to detriment to Mr I.
Having considered the entirety of the matter I do not think  this complaint should be upheld.  I 
say this for the following  reasons:
WorldPay has described  how the change of settlement  times  has occurred due to a 
change in its processes. And that accounts  were migrated from the old process to the 
current process at different times.  It has said Company S was migrated on 31 August 
2018. Mr I complained to it on 11 September 2018. So it looks like the complaint 
stems from the change  in process.
WorldPay has pointed out that it notified all its account holders prior to the change by 
email. It has supplied  a copy of the email text sent to all account holders.  Having  
considered this it makes  clear the change in timing of settlement. Its of note that the 
change just meant money cleared  in early afternoon rather than first thing in the 
morning as had been the case. It still cleared on the same  day though-so not a 
substantial change  in my view.
Ref: DRN30315582Mr I says he never got the email. However  Ive considered the email  WorldPay say it 
used and the email  address Mr I has provided.  I dont think  WorldPay has made  a 
mistake here.
I can imagine  that it was inconvenient not being  able to pay the supplier when Mr I 
tried to do so. However Im satisfied Mr I was sent notice of the change and so I think  
any inconvenience suffered wasnt as a result of what  WorldPay  did. I think it 
properly notified  Company S of the change in settlement  due to the change  in its 
processes.
WorldPay isnt responsible for the email provider  Mr I uses  or for whether the email 
was read. It can only be held responsible for what it does.
Considering  the situation I think WorldPays offer of £50 is generous considering it 
hasnt done anything wrong.
For the sake of completeness I note that Mr I is also a director  of another  similarly  
named company. If that company has had any problems with WorldPay  Mr I should  
complain to it direct in the first instance.
I am sorry  to say I dont  think  Mr Is comments are sufficiently  persuasive for me to uphold 
this complaint considering the evidence  available. I cant see any significant mistake  that 
WorldPay has made. So, in short, this complaint does  not succeed.  And as a consequence I 
dont think Company S should be compensated for loss of reputation-as I dont think thats 
WorldPays fault.
I appreciate this will be very disappointing for Mr I. He, on behalf  of Company S is at liberty 
not to accept this decision  and thus not be bound  by it. However this decision does bring to 
an end this complaint  about WorldPay at this service.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I do not uphold the complaint against WorldPay  (UK) Limited. 
It has nothing more  to do with regard to this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr I, on behalf of 
Company S to accept or reject my decision before 24 February 2019.
