The complaint
Mr M complains that the investment recommended by Nationwide Building Society in 2014 
was not carried out as agreed. He also complains about the advisor fees hes paid.
What happened
Mr M met with an advisor from Nationwide in January 2014. The content of the meeting, and 
what was agreed, was set out in a suitability letter dated 25 February 2014. It was agreed 
that the money Mr M had available for investment would be invested as follows:
Stocks and shares ISA £17,783.47, including initial advice charge
Unit trust/OEIC £15,206.22, including initial advice charge
The investment in the stocks and shares ISA was to be made up from a transfer of 
£11,845.32 from Mr Ms existing cash ISA, plus £5,760 from his savings account. (The ISA 
allowance for 2014/15 was £11,520 and he had already used half of that allowance). But 
only £6085.32 was transferred from his cash ISA. This left £5,760 in his cash ISA that should 
have been transferred to the stocks and shares ISA.
In November 2014, Mr M met with another advisor from Nationwide, as the person who gave 
him the advice in July had left. This advisor arranged to invest the remaining £5,760 as 
originally intended. But the sum was taken from Mr Ms savings account, not his cash ISA, 
and it was invested into an OEIC, not into the stocks and shares ISA. The advisor also 
arranged to transfer £14,998.55 from the OEIC to the stocks and shares ISA to utilise Mr Ms 
2014/15 allowance. Towards the end of the year, Mr M withdrew the remaining balance from 
his cash ISA and closed it.
Mr M said he realised in 2019 that not all of his money was invested in an ISA and that hed 
been paying ongoing advice charges.
Nationwide accepted it had done something wrong. It said the full cash ISA balance was 
only partially transferred to Mr Ms stocks and shares ISA. Then an amount equivalent to the 
amount remaining in it was taken from a different account and invested in an OEIC outside 
of the ISA wrapper. Nationwide said Mr M could transfer his non-ISA investment into the 
stocks and shares ISA  as Mr M had already used his 2019/20 allowance, he should give 
this instruction at the start of the 2020/21 tax year. It calculated that there had been a 
minimal loss caused by £5,760 not being invested in the stocks and shares ISA as intended 
in February 2014 of £12.30. It paid Mr M £100 to cover this loss and to compensate him for 
the distress and inconvenience caused. It did not uphold his complaint about advice fees, 
saying this had been agreed at the outset and was also covered in the annual reports he 
received.
Our investigator concluded that the complaint should be upheld. She thought Nationwide 
should recalculate the loss to bring it up to date, rather than as at the date Mr M complained. 
And she thought Nationwide should pay Mr M £250 for the trouble and upset it had caused 
(so an additional £163.30, taking into account the £87.70 already paid).
Nationwide didnt agree saying, in summary, that:
The loss was calculated as at the date Mr M raised his concerns. The timeline since it 
issued its final response to Mr Ms complaint is out of Nationwides control.
Theres no evidence of what was discussed and agreed when Mr M met with the second 
advisor. So the advisor may not have made a mistake but may have been acting on 
Mr Ms revised instructions.
Mr M had ample opportunity to bring the error to Nationwides attention before 2019, 
which would have enabled the mistake to be corrected.
Mr M sent several letters to Nationwide when he complained in 2019 but he wasnt 
caused particular inconvenience when the error occurred. The amount Nationwide paid 
Mr M fairly compensates him.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Investment in the stocks and shares ISA
The February 2014 suitability letter clearly sets out what was agreed should happen here. 
The full balance in Mr Ms existing cash ISA, £11,845.32 should have been transferred to the 
new stocks and shares ISA. And, to fully utilise his 2014/15 ISA allowance, a further £5,760, 
plus initial charges, should also have been invested in the stocks and shares ISA.
The appendix included in Nationwides final response to Mr Ms complaint, summarises what 
actually happened and Ill reproduce it here:
Date Stocks and 
shares ISAUnit 
Trust/OEIC Notes
3/4 March 2014 £5,760 
invested£14,750.03 
investedAs you'd had already used your 
5,760 Cash ISA allowance for 
2013/14, this Stocks & Shares ISA 
investment used up your
remaining 2013/14 total ISA 
allowance (11,520). Hence 
14,750.03 was invested outside 
of your ISA.
11 March 2014 £5,902.76 
investedThis was a Cash ISA transfer-in 
(and so utilised a previous year's 
Cash ISA allowance) and took a 
little longer to process, so was 
invested about a week later.
15 July 2014 £14,998.55 
switched-outThis was to switch the investment 
to your Stocks & Shares ISA. It 
fully utilised the 15,000 ISA 
allowance for 2014/15.
16/17 July 2014 £14,998.55 Your Unit Trust/OEIC monies were switched-in switched-in to your ISA, to use up 
your 2014/15 ISA allowance.
29 July 2014 £5,760 
investedThis additional new investment 
came from a non-ISA account and 
couldn't go into your ISA as that 
year's allowance had already been 
fully utilised.
£5,760 should have been transferred from the cash ISA to the stocks and shares portfolio in 
March 2014. An investment of this amount was made in July 2014  but not from the cash 
ISA and not into the stocks and shares ISA. Nationwide says Mr M may have given revised 
instructions in July 2014. But Ive not seen any evidence to suggest this might be the case.
Nationwide accepts that it made a mistake. It says it will compensate Mr M for the sum of 
£5,750 not being invested in his stocks and shares ISA since 29 July 2014. But as the 
investment should have taken place in March 2014, I find compensation should be 
calculated from that date. Following Mr Ms complaint and Nationwides response, the 
earliest Mr M could have acted to transfer the sum to his ISA was on 6 April 2020, as hed 
already fully utilised his 2019/20 allowance. So the loss calculation should be from 3 March 
2014 to 6 April 2020. In its final response letter, Nationwide has explained how it calculated 
the loss figure, and I think this is a fair and reasonable approach. Using that same approach, 
but taking into account the revised dates, Nationwide should pay Mr M £14.76.
I cant order Nationwide to transfer the OEIC investment into the ISA  the third-party ISA 
manager needs Mr Ms instructions to do that. I would expect Nationwide to assist Mr M if he 
is unsure what to do, and not to charge him for that. But, if Mr M wants advice on the 
suitability of his existing investments, he will need to pay the appropriate fee.
Ongoing fees
Mr M complains that he was charged ongoing advice fees by Nationwide. I agree with our 
investigator that Mr M agreed to these fees at the outset and that the tariff of charges 
detailed what was service was provided for this fee. In the circumstances I dont find that 
Nationwide is obliged to refund any of the fees its charged.
Distress and inconvenience
I now need to decide how much Nationwide should pay Mr M to compensate him for the 
distress and inconvenience caused. Nationwide made a mistake in March 2014 when it 
failed to transfer all the cash ISA into the stocks and shares ISA. And it failed to correct its 
mistake when it had the opportunity to do so in July 2014. It has suggested that Mr M should 
have realised a mistake had been made  and that he should certainly have realised this 
before 2019. It told him, for example, that you didnt check that [the application] was 
processed correctly. Its clear that Mr M, in his circumstances, found this particularly 
upsetting. He was an inexperienced investor and hed sought help from Nationwide. He 
should reasonably have expected Nationwide to carry out the investment as agreed and, 
when a mistake was made, it should reasonably have expected Nationwide to identify that 
and put it right.
Nationwide didnt correct the mistake when it had the opportunity to do so. This made things 
unnecessarily complicated and more difficult for Mr M to understand what happened and 
how things should be put right. I do think Nationwide could have been more sympathetic to 
Mr M in his circumstances and its clear from his communications with us that hes been worried and upset by what Nationwide has done and its suggestion that Mr M was somehow 
to blame. 
Taking all this into account, I think our investigators recommendation for Nationwide to pay 
£250 in total for the distress and inconvenience caused is fair and reasonable.
My final decision
My final decision is that Nationwide Building Society should:
1. Pay Mr M £14.76 to compensate him for the investment not being made in an ISA.
2. Pay Mr M £150, in addition to the £100 it has already paid, to compensate him for the 
distress and inconvenience caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 October 2021.
