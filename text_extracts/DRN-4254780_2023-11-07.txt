The complaint
Mr M complains he cant open a student account with National Westminster Bank Plc 
(NatWest).
What happened
Mr M is an EU student studying in the UK. In March 2023, he applied to open a current 
account with NatWest, using his university accommodation address.
NatWest declined to agree to the application as Mr Ms student loan offer (used as proof of 
address) included his previous address  and so the two addresses were different. NatWest 
wouldnt accept Mr Ms tenancy agreement which showed his university address.
Mr M complained. He said the decision wasnt fair. He needs an account to live and has a 
cheque to pay in. He said he has a right to an account. 
NatWest said the account application failed their tests  as the two addresses were different. 
They needed to carry out proof of address checks to keep customers safe from fraud. They 
didnt uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Mr M brought his complaint to us. Our investigator didnt uphold it. She said Mr Ms 
application failed because his address couldnt be verified as part of NatWests checks.
Mr M asked that an ombudsman looks at his complaint. He said he had an HMRC cheque to 
pay in, and his tenancy on his accommodation at the university included utilities  so why 
couldnt that be used as proof of address? 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Let me say at the outset that this service resolves individual disputes between customers 
and financial businesses. We dont take sides. And Ive looked at all the evidence here in 
coming to a decision. We arent the regulator of NatWest  thats the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). So  we dont tell businesses to change their policies or practices. So  
here, its for NatWest to make its own commercial decisions as to how it runs its account 
opening. 
All banks, including NatWest, must carry out proof of address checks  as part of their 
obligations to prevent fraud and financial crime. In this case, the address on Mr Ms student 
loan offer wasnt the same as the address he put down on his application for a bank account. 
So - he failed NatWests checks.
Mr M argues he is entitled to open an account  but Im afraid to say thats not the case. In 
this case, its for NatWest to take its own commercial decisions about Mr Ms account 
application, based on its own checks. 
We asked Mr M if we could see his HMRC cheque and its attachment  and it does show his 
new student address. Looking at NatWests operating instructions, if he had shown this to 
NatWest, I think its possible it wouldve been accepted as proof of address. But  I can see 
he didnt use this, which was unfortunate.
I asked Mr M if he had another UK bank account  to see what the impact was on him. He 
told us he has now opened an account with another bank and deposited the cheque in it. So 
while I accept the frustration that Mr M has felt during the application process with NatWest, 
the actual impact on him has been lessened.
In looking at Mr Ms complaint, we put it to NatWest that what happened must be a common 
occurrence with student accounts  and asked if they would consider agreeing to open an 
account for Mr M, based on his student lease. NatWest said they would consider it - if Mr M 
was to call their account exceptions team  and we have that phone number. But as Mr M 
now has an account with another bank, I presume he wont want to follow this up.
I know this was a frustrating episode for Mr M  but in summary, NatWest did follow their 
operating processes, and while I appreciate this will be disappointing for him, I dont uphold 
his complaint.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 December 2023.
