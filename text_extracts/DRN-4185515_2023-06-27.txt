The complaint
Miss R complains Evergreen Finance Limited London trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk 
(MoneyBoat) agreed to freeze the interest on her loan balance when she notified them of her 
financial difficulties. Miss R also says MoneyBoat added further interest to the balance once 
it defaulted the account in March 2022.
What happened
Although not an unaffordable lending complaint, this complaint stems from a £300 loan that
Miss R was provided with in May 2020. Miss R was due to make four payments to
MoneyBoat of £105.98 between May and August 2020.
Miss R made her first payment in May 2020 as expected. However, no further contractual
repayments have been made. But Miss R did make payments to MoneyBoat through a third-
party charity who arranged a debt management plan with MoneyBoat. Payments were then
made between August 2020 and December 2020 when the payments ceased.
There doesnt appear to have been much contact between January 2021 and March 2022
when MoneyBoat contacted Miss Rs third-party organisation and MoneyBoat was told it
wasnt acting on Miss Rs behalf anymore.
Since April 2022, Miss R has been making regular payments to MoneyBoat of between £1
and £5 per month. By March 2023, based on MoneyBoats statement of account, Miss R had
paid a total to it of £254.11. MoneyBoat has said as of April 2023, Miss R still owed £197.12
which MoneyBoat says includes a £15 late fee.
Following Miss Rs complaint, MoneyBoat issued a final response letter (FRL) in which it
didnt uphold her complaint. MoneyBoat said it was aware Miss R was dealing with the third-
party debt charity in June 2020 at which point it suspended interest on the account for 
30 days. After the 30 days hold, MoneyBoat said it tried to engage with Miss R and during 
this time she had made further applications for loans.
It wasnt until 7 August 2020 that MoneyBoat heard from the third party acting on Miss Rs
behalf. Payments were then made to MoneyBoat until 8 December 2020. By
January 2022, it says it had heard from the third party as it was no longer assisting 
Miss R.
MoneyBoat says it reached out to Miss R but when it didnt hear back it defaulted the
account in March 2022. It concluded, given the credit agreement, that the amount it was
asking Miss R to repay was correct. In terms of the default date, MoneyBoat concluded:
As per our obligations, we report monthly to credit agencies, it would appear that they
have incorrectly interpreted data and applied a default notice earlier than it occurred.
This is likely because some lenders will automatically default an account once three
payments are missed, however, due to your contact with [third party debt charity] and
the subsequent arrangement, we had not taken the decision to default the account.
MoneyBoat agreed to leave the default date as of December 2020 rather than the later date
of March 2022  which would be more beneficial for Miss R. Unhappy with this response,
Miss R referred her complaint to the Financial Ombudsman.
The complaint was then considered by an adjudicator. He thought, MoneyBoat had made an
error by knowing Miss R was likely in financial difficulties and then when the payment plan
ended, it didnt offer any further forbearance and added interest.
He also thought, given the way the account had been maintained that it was always going to
be defaulted. And therefore, thinking about MoneyBoats explanation of the default date, the
adjudicator thought it was beneficial for Miss R to have the default recorded from 
December 2020. 
Finally, he didnt think any payment of compensation was due to Miss R because she
hadnt been in contact with MoneyBoat about this matter. In order to put things right for 
Miss R he asked MoneyBoat to do:
[MoneyBoat] should remove all the interest you added to Miss R [full name
removed]s loan after you became aware of her financial difficulties and treat her with
appropriate forbearance if she is still in financial difficulties with regards to the
remaining balance.
In response to the adjudicators assessment, Miss R sent a number of emails (with additional
information). Ive read these in full, and Ive outlined below a summary of her response:
After receiving the default notice, she received a letter (photos of the letter have been 
provided) from MoneyBoat about repaying the loan  Miss R says this was
completed and returned recorded delivery.
Miss R was unsure as to the amount she had already paid MoneyBoat.
Miss R reiterated she is on long term sick due to some mental health problems and
she says she is being harassed by MoneyBoat for her payments.
On days when she is due to make repayments to MoneyBoat she receives emails
and text messages before 9:30 am  she says they are not giving her time to make
the payment. Miss R then provided screen shots of a number of text messages she
had received on 26 August 2022 asking her whether she had made her payment.
Miss R says MoneyBoat are threatening court action because it wants her to pay 
more per month.
Miss R provided a copy of an email she sent to the third-party debt charity outlining
her creditors and how much she owed.
Miss R provided screen shots of her credit file, which showed that the outstanding
balance to pay was either £253 or £391. The later amount, screen shot was dated
July 2022  which is after the account was defaulted.
MoneyBoat responded to the adjudicators assessment. In response it said:
MoneyBoat was well within its right to continue to charge interest, as per the credit
agreement.
No additional interest was charged after Miss Rs debt management plan failed  and 
so there wouldnt be anything else to remove.
Miss R agreed to pay £123.92 in interest  as outlined in the agreement, and any
extra interest was charged after the period of the interest free and before MoneyBoat
heard from the debt charity.
As no agreement has been reached on progressing Miss Rs complaint, the case waspassed to me to resolve. I then issued a provisional decision explaining the reasons why 
I was intending to uphold Miss Rs complaint in part. A copy of the provisional findings 
follows this in smaller text and forms part of this final decision.
Both parties were asked to response to the provisional decision as soon as possible, but in 
any event, no later than 9 June 2023. 
Miss R responded to the provisional decision, and Ive read in full what she said, and Ive 
summarised her response below:
Miss R would like the interest removed from the loan that was added to the balance 
in August, September and October 2020.
Miss R would also like the £15 late fee removed. 
Miss R said MoneyBoat is one of a number of creditors and she is paying it through a 
well-known third-party debt advice charity. 
Miss R has asked for MoneyBoat to send a copy of the call recording from when she 
first contacted it about her difficulties. 
MoneyBoat emailed to say it had nothing further to add. 
As the deadline has now passed, and both parties have made further submissions I have 
proceeded to issue the final decision. 
What I said in my provisional decision:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss R has told us that she suffers with some mental health problems, and I am sorry to
hear that. After making enquires with MoneyBoat it explained the first it became aware of
these was in December 2022. And Ive not seen anything to suggest that it was on notice
about it before then.
However, MoneyBoat has accepted it now knows and it needs to keep that in mind when
dealing with Miss R moving forward. But as MoneyBoat wasnt aware of it when either the
loan was approved, or the complaint was made, I cant say that MoneyBoat has done
anything wrong in not adjusting its communication with her.
Miss R also says she is being harassed on the day her payments are due to be made and
has been threatened with court action because MoneyBoat wants her to pay more because
she says the amounts, she is paying each month isnt sufficient. However, the complaint is
about whether MoneyBoat froze the interest rate when Miss R notified it of her financial
difficulties, and it is that I have focused on.
Miss R is clearly, from her emails concerned about these messages she is receiving. She
needs to raise this with MoneyBoat directly to allow it to investigate her concerns.
MoneyBoat has now said it is on notice of her health problems and it will need to react
accordingly. After MoneyBoat has completed its investigation, then its at that point, the
Financial Ombudsman may be able to become involved.
Default
MoneyBoat says that after payments stopped in December 2020, and after being told that
the third party was no longer acting on Miss Rs behalf it took steps to contact her at which
point it defaulted the account.
However, MoneyBoat has explained what may have happened around the recording of thedefault date. I can see the default date has been recorded as 24 December 2020  even
though the default wasnt actually requested to be added to Miss Rs credit file until 
March 2022.
MoneyBoat says it wont make adjustments to that date because in effect it shows that
Miss R has already had the default on her credit file for over two years, whereas changing it
would result in Miss R only having it on her file for a little over a year. By leaving the earlier
date on her credit file, it means the default will be removed in December 2026 rather than
March 2028.
I would say, reference to the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) in its paper entitled
Principles for the Reporting of Arrears, Arrangements and Defaults at Credit Reference
Agencies, is relevant here. These principles set out when a lender can or cannot record
adverse information on a credit file.
I am satisfied that by December 2020, the account was sufficiently in arrears for the default
to be applied. On top of this, MoneyBoat knew of Miss Rs financial difficulties because she
was on a repayment plan  that appeared to fail in December 2020. And so, in line with what
the ICO says  I think it wouldve been reasonable at that time for a default to have been
applied. In any event, MoneyBoat has said it wont make any adjustments to the default date
and I consider that to be fair and reasonable.
Interest
In summary, MoneyBoat says it has charged an additional £12.31 interest, on top of what
the credit agreement said would be charged - £123.92. Therefore, MoneyBoat has said,
there is very little refund due to Miss R, because it hasnt charged that much above what it
said it would charge Miss R in the credit agreement.
Section 12(b) of the credit agreement is relevant from MoneyBoats viewpoint because it
explains what happens if a payment isnt made on the agreed date. And so, explains why it
said it was within its rights to charge interest, as the credit agreement outlined.
(b). interest on all unpaid principle at the rate of 0.7% per day subject to the total amount of 
interest payable under this agreement not exceeding 100% of the amount of credit provided, 
including all interest, fees and charges.
In effect, what this condition allows MoneyBoat to do, is charge additional interest (on top of
what is outlined in the credit agreement) so the maximum amount a consumer would be able
to repay up to 100% of the amount borrowed.
So, using Miss Rs case as an example, MoneyBoat  under this term could have collected
no more than 100% of the amount borrowed equalling £600. Clearly, given the amounts that
appear on Miss Rs credit file, and from the statements provided by MoneyBoat this sum isnt
what is being asked to be paid.
Ive also kept in mind what the industry regulation says (The Financial Conduct Authority) in
the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  which is the relevant guidance for these sorts of
loans. In particular, Ive paid attention to CONC 7.3 Treatment of customers in default or
arrears (including repossessions): lenders, owners and debt collectors.
From the contact notes provided by MoneyBoat I can see Miss R contacted it on
11 June 2020 to let them know she was having financial difficulties. On this date, MoneyBoat
cancelled Miss Rs payment method  a continuous payment authority (CPA) and it does say
it offered a 30 day hold on the account.
Miss R says that MoneyBoat on this call offered to freeze the interest and charges, whereas
MoneyBoat says it would freeze the interest during the 30 days hold which was applied to
the account. A copy of the call hasnt been provided, but I have a copy of the call notes
supplied by MoneyBoat to indicate what was discussed. But given there is some agreementabout the interest being suspended, I think its likely, that MoneyBoat agreed to suspend the
interest during the 30 days hold period. Which at the time wouldve been a reasonable
course of action.
There was then a further call on 16 June 2020  where Miss R provided MoneyBoat with a
reference number showing that she had approached the third-party debt charity.
A late payment fee appears to have then been imposed because Miss R hadnt made the
payment due on 26 June 2020  presumably because of the 30 days hold on the account
and the CPA being cancelled. The hold on the account ended on 11 July 2020.
The contact notes show the next time MoneyBoat spoke to Miss R was on 3 August 2020
where she reiterated, she was seeking a debt plan with the third party. It does seem, though
that the debt charity (based on what Miss R has said) had already provided paperwork in the
post but that hadnt yet been received by MoneyBoat. Bearing in mind this was during the
COVID-19 pandemic this may not be surprising given the changes in working patterns and
the restrictions on certain activities.
Then the first payment made under this debt plan was made on 8 August 2020. MoneyBoat
says by now the interest was frozen on the account. I would say the statement of account
doesnt show when interest was frozen (or not) and what extra interest has been charged.
Only a list of payments that Miss R has made, the amount borrowed and what MoneyBoat
calls a Summary which looks to be how the total amount Miss R has currently paid has
been allocated to capital, interest and charges. This isnt helpful, because it does make it
difficult to work out when MoneyBoat was and wasnt applying interest to the balance.
I also think, when MoneyBoat says the interest was frozen, it means it was frozen to extra
interest and / or charges being applied to the balance. But it had still charged Miss R the
contractual amount of interest it said it would charge in the credit agreement.
But CONC 7.3  as Ive set out above provides details of some of the tools available to a
lender when a lender says that a customer is in financial difficulties. CONC 7.3.5G says:
Examples of treating a customer with forbearance would include the firm doing one
or more of the following, as may be relevant in the circumstances:
(1) considering suspending, reducing, waiving or cancelling any further interest or
charges (for example, when a customer provides evidence of financial difficulties and
is unable to meet repayments as they fall due or is only able to make
token repayments, where in either case the level of debt would continue to rise if
interest and charges continue to be applied);
So CONC clearly outlines that a lender (or firm) must do one or more of the following. So,
while I agree, that there was no requirement from the regulator for interest to be stopped, it
does say these actions should be considered such as reducing or cancelling interest.
MoneyBoat has said interest was frozen while the 30 day hold was applied. But yet further
interest was added after that. Clearly, Miss R given what she had told MoneyBoat was in
financial difficulties to the extent that a third party was stepping in and helping her. So, the
30 day hold initially, was fair and reasonable.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
MoneyBoat didnt have anything further to add, so I take from that it is content with the 
outcome that which was reached in the provisional decision. While Miss R broadly agreed with the outcome that was reached, she has made some 
further comments, and having thought about these, it hasnt changed my mind about the 
outcome that I have reached and Ive explained why below. 
Having looked back through the statement of account MoneyBoat has provided, it isnt clear 
exactly what date the late payment fee was added to the balance. Although MoneyBoat has 
confirmed it has been added to the current outstanding balance.
Given what I concluded in the provisional decision about offering help and forbearance from 
11 June 202, if the late payment fee was added to the balance after this date, I consider it 
reasonable for the late payment fee to be removed from the current outstanding total that 
Miss R is due to pay MoneyBoat.  
In response to the provisional decision, Miss R has requested a copy of the call she had with 
MoneyBoat when she first contacted it.  A copy of this call hasnt been provided to the 
Financial Ombudsman by MoneyBoat as part of this complaint. So, I dont know if this call is 
even available to be sent, but Miss R may wish to approach MoneyBoat separately to see if 
it can be sent  if she requires it. 
Based on the evidence that I have, Ive been able to reach what I consider a fair and 
reasonable outcome without the need for the telephone call based on the content of the call 
notes provided by MoneyBoat. 
An outstanding balance remains due, but Miss R says she currently has a repayment plan in 
place which she is happy to stick to until the total re-worked outstanding balance has been 
repaid. This doesnt seem unreasonable, but Ill leave it up to Miss R and MoneyBoat to 
discuss this. 
Putting things right
Re-work Miss Rs outstanding balance taking account that MoneyBoat only applied
interest on the amount borrowed up to and including 11 June 2020. This may also 
include the removal of the late payment fee if it was added on or after 11 June 2020.
Ensure Miss Rs credit file is updated to reflect the current outstanding balance.
Provide Miss R with written confirmation as to the total amount she be repaying
MoneyBoat and how much she has already repaid it.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in the provisional decision, Im upholding Miss Rs 
complaint in part.
Evergreen Finance Limited London trading as MoneyBoat.co.uk should put things right for 
Miss R as directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 July 2023.
