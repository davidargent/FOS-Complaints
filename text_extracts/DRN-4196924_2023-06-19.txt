The complaint
Mrs T complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) caused an exchange loss.
What happened
Mrs T was getting money together to pay for a property renovation. She had a GBP account 
with HSBC, and a euro currency account. In September 2022, she wanted to send funds (in 
euros) from her euro currency account to a foreign exchange firm (who I will call A). As euro 
account was held with another UK clearing bank (who I will call B). A were then to convert 
Mrs Ts euros to GBP for her to pay builders etc. 
On 23 September 2022, she called HSBC about the charges for transfers. On the same day, 
she called HSBC and made a payment of euro 25,000 to As euro account with B. On 28 
September 2022, she made an online payment of euro 50,000 to As euro account with B. It 
was held for fraud checks by HSBC and on 29 September 2022, she spoke to HSBC about 
the payment. There were three calls on that day.
As a result of what happened on the calls on 29 September 2022, Mrs T cancelled the 
payment.  She then made further payments to As euro account at B as follows:
6 October 2022  euro 50,000
10 November 2022  euro 50,000
11 November 2022  euro 50,000
14 November 2022  euro 50,000
Mrs T complained. She said:
- She was told on the calls on 23 September 2022 that a charge would be made for 
the payments. This wasnt correct and was not what she was told when she opened 
the euro account.
- She was then told again there would be a charge - on the calls on 29 September 
2022  this again was wrong. 
- On the call with HSBCs fraud department on 29 September 2022, she was told the 
payment was in GBP and from her GBP account. This was a major error and caused 
her to cancel the payment. She tried to tell HSBCs fraud officer several times that it 
was a euro payment from her euro account (for euro 50,000)  but she couldnt make 
her understand.
- A was offering a better euro/GBP exchange rate if she exchanged at least euro 
75,000. Because she had only sent euro 25,000 (as HSBC hadnt sent the payment 
for euro 50,000), she got a worse rate. She said the rate for euro 25,000 was 0.886, 
and the rate for euro 75,000 was 0.89. She showed the evidence for that provided by 
A.
- She said she held off making the further payments of euros and because the 
exchange rate moved against her, she suffered a loss of £2,422.50.
- She suffered a lot of stress and anxiety because of the bad service and errors at 
HSBC.
HSBC said the payment of euro 50,000 was held for fraud checks. This was in line with 
HSBCs processes and policy. They apologised for the service Mrs T had on the call on 29 
September 2022. When HSBCs fraud team look at a payment, they see a GBP equivalent, 
which explained the error on the call. But they confirmed Mrs T had wanted to make a euro 
payment. The apologised for misadvising Mrs T there would be a charge and confirmed that 
currency payments sent within the EEA are free. HSBC paid compensation of £200.
Mrs T brought her complaint to us. Our investigator said HSBC had acknowledged the errors 
and paid £200. But he also said HSBC should pay the exchange losses of £873.45  being 
the loss because of the payment being made a few days later. He didnt feel that it was fair 
to ask HSBC to meet further losses through to November 2022  it was Mrs Ts decision to 
withhold the further payments until then.
Mrs T didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at her complaint. She maintained her 
losses were £2,422.50, and that compensation of £200 wasnt enough for the stress she 
suffered.
I reached a provisional decision which said:
At the outset, let me say that HSBCs decision to hold the payment of euro 50,000 for fraud 
checks was reasonable  it was part of HSBCs processes to do that to protect the bank and 
customers from fraud. So  I set that aside. But thats not the crux of Mrs Ts complaint.
Charges for euro payments: I looked at HSBCs terms and conditions for euro currency 
accounts. These clearly say there are no charges for euro payments to other UK banks - 
which Mrs Ts payment was. I listened to the calls on 23 September 2022. On two of the 
calls, Mrs T was told there would be a charge. This were clearly errors.
On the calls on 29 September 2022, the fraud officer told Mrs T several times that there 
would be a charge. This was a further error.  Mrs T then questioned this and told the fraud 
officer that wasnt correct and that the payment shed made on 23 September 2022 was free. 
The fraud officer told Mrs T several times that she had been charged  this was also another 
error, as she hadnt been.
Calls on 29 September 2022: this led to the main complaint from Mrs T. These were calls 
between Mrs T and HSBCs fraud officer, who was to go through fraud checks before 
releasing the payment  which was, as Ive said, a reasonable thing to do. But  the calls 
were handled very poorly. Mrs T was told at least five times (on the three calls) that the 
payment was from her GBP account to A. HSBCs fraud officer said the amount was 
£47,567.90. But of course  the payment was for euro 50,000 from her euro account.
Mrs T questioned this each time. She asked HSBCs officer for the sort code and account 
number being debited  and this was clearly her euro account. But  the officer still insisted it 
was a GBP to euro payment. And  this was in the light of Mrs T having instructed the 
payment herself  online - from her euro account. And  as Mrs T said on the call, there 
wasnt enough money in her GBP account to make such a GBP payment. So  I can see 
why this was so distressing and frustrating for Mrs T.
Mrs T then lost all confidence in the fraud officer and asked that the payment be cancelled. And although she didnt say this on the call  I think it is reasonable to say she must have 
been concerned that there would be an exchange rate cost of converting from GBP to euro.
Mrs T asked to speak to a manager but was told that wasnt possible and would need to 
make a complaint. She was promised a call back within 48 hours about the complaint. This 
was also an error  as HSBCs process allows for a response within eight weeks. And when 
HSBCs complaint handler called Mrs T on 3 October 2022  he advised Mrs T of that.
Mrs T was clearly distressed and upset on the calls on 29 September 2022. I can see why. I 
think its reasonable to say she wasnt experienced in such matters and was making the euro 
payments for the first time. She was making arrangements to renovate her retirement home. 
So - I can understand why she was so upset.  
HSBC made a series of errors regarding the advice there would be a charge  she was 
mistakenly told twice on earlier calls, and then repeatedly on the 29 September 2022 call  
she was again told there would be a charge. And was also told she had been charged for the 
previous payment  which she clearly hadnt been. 
And  I think it is fair for me to say that for HSBCs fraud officer to state that Mrs T was 
making a GBP payment (on the 29 September 2020 call) was a serious (and basic) error. 
And it was repeated several times, despite Mrs T trying to correct the call handler. I think  
because this was such a fundamental mistake and because it (understandably) caused Mrs 
T such distress, I think an increased payment of compensation of £400 is justified. I know 
this goes beyond our normal criteria for such an error, but Im confident this is the right thing 
to do here  in the circumstances of this complaint.
Exchange Loss: Mrs T says she lost on the exchange rate because she needed to get euro 
75,000 to A to get a better rate. And she couldnt do that because of what happened. She 
says she waited to make the further payments  which I can see she did - in November 
2022. But I think that was her decision to make. So  I dont think its reasonable for me to 
agree to a financial loss on all the payments assuming she made them in November 2022. 
But it is fair to calculate a loss on the one payment of euro 50,000 - which was delayed from 
28 September 2022 to 6 October 2022. 
HSBC calculated the loss as £873.45  because of the delay in making the payment. And 
have agreed to pay it. So  I agree with that.
Responses to the provisional decision:
HSBC said theyd not calculated the exchange loss as I had stated. They said Mrs T didnt 
suffer an exchange loss  as the payment was from a euro account to another euro account. 
Mrs T said her losses were more than £873, but she accepted the provisional decision.
I now need to consider these comments. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I accept that HSBC didnt calculate the exchange loss. But  there was a loss as Mrs T 
evidenced that she was to get the exchange firm (A) to buy GBP with the euros to be 
transferred. The loss of £873 was worked out by our investigator and was for the period 
from 28 September 2022 to 6 October 2022.Ive considered Mrs Ts comments about further losses  but as the provisional decision set 
out, I dont think its reasonable to ask HSBC to pay any further losses beyond 6 October 
2022  as it was Mrs Ts decision to delay the further payments after that.
Therefore, my final decision is in line with the provisional decision.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. HSBC UK Bank Plc must:
Pay compensation of  £400 for distress and inconvenience. This is in addition to the 
£200 already paid.
Pay £873.45  being the exchange loss on the transaction.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 July 2023.
