The complaint
Mr M complains that over many years, Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited provided him 
with unreliable information about the value of his pension fund. He says this has caused 
him to lose out financially as he couldnt place any reliance on what he was being told 
about his fund value. Further, he says he ended up transferring away from Aviva due to 
this situation, because it was affecting his pension planning and his confidence in Aviva 
managing his pension. He says as a result of transferring he lost a valuable guaranteed 
annuity rate he had on his policy.
To put things right Mr M wants Aviva to compensate him for the stress hes suffered as a 
result, at a time when he was in poor health due to a serious medical condition. 
What happened
Mr M had a plan (ending 321) with Aviva. Over the years he received valuations setting 
out the estimated value of his fund at retirement.
Mr M says he was given the following information about the estimated value of his fund:
February 2016 £109,985.84
March 2016 £110,678.57
March 2017 £135,167.00
December 2017 £143,126.36
March 2018 £112,553.00
September 2018 £118,985.94 
29 January 2019 £116,712.93
30 January 2019 £ 109,469.58
3 May 2019 £109,469.58
Following a complaint to Aviva about miscommunications about his fund value, Aviva 
accepted it had provided Mr M with incorrect values from 2017. It said this was due to a 
system error. It said it discovered this when Mr Ms financial adviser queried why there was a 
large difference in values quoted just a day apart on 29 and 30 January 2019.
Aviva told Mr M the correct value of his fund at these specified dates was:
02 March 2017 -  £125,243.98
02 March 2018 - £104,286.61
02 March 2019 - £109,649.58
It said the reduction in end value from the 2017 figure was due to a lower final bonus 
being paid.
Mr M says that as a result of him receiving unreliable information about the value of 
his fund, he could not plan his retirement with any confidence. 
Mr M says this is not an isolated situation and points out press coverage where others 
have found themselves in a similar situation to him, where their retirement estimates 
could not be relied upon.
To settle the complaint Aviva offered Mr M £150 for the distress and inconvenience 
caused. It also offered to pay him £453.74 being the amount he had lost out on due to 
delays when transferring to his new scheme. Aviva said it calculated his loss based on 
how Mr M had invested his fund upon transfer.
Our investigator looked into Mr Ms complaint. He asked Aviva to provide a full breakdown of 
how it had assessed Mr Ms losses.
Aviva said the correct amount (£109,649.58) had been transferred to Mr Ms new plan, but 
that payment couldve been made 25 days sooner. Our investigator noted that 8% 
compensatory interest hadnt been added, which this service wouldve expected.
To settle this complaint, our investigator proposed that Aviva should pay Mr M £500 for the 
trouble and upset he had been caused by this. He said Aviva should recalculate Mr Ms 
losses and add 8% compensatory interest as per our guidelines. And lastly, Aviva should 
also provide detailed evidence to show that £109,649.58 was the correct transfer value.
Aviva didnt accept our investigators conclusion. It increased its offer for Mr Ms trouble and 
upset to £300 and agreed to recalculate the interest at 8%. Aviva provided our investigator 
with information from its actuaries regarding the fund value. Our investigator considered 
this to be a fair offer of settlement in all the circumstances.
Mr M didnt accept Avivas revised offer of settlement. He took the view that Aviva should 
honour one of the earlier higher valuations and pay him a higher amount of compensation 
given the trouble and upset hed been caused.
As agreement couldnt be reached Mr Ms complaint now comes to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Where something has gone wrong, as it has here, this service aims to put the consumer 
back into the same position they wouldve been in financially but for the error or omission. 
Based on what I have seen, it seems that Aviva paid the correct fund value (£109,649.58) 
into Mr Ms new scheme. I cant reasonably require Aviva to pay Mr M more than he was 
entitled to simply because it miscommunicated his fund value. 
Aviva has now agreed to pay Mr M interest at 8% to compensate him for the delays in 
paying this correct sum into his new scheme. I consider this to be a fair response in the 
circumstances and consistent with what this service usually expects in circumstances like 
this. 
I fully accept these miscommunications caused Mr M some trouble and upset to his 
retirement planning, at what was already a difficult time for him given his ill health. Further, 
he was given incorrect information on more than one occasion. Overall, however, I consider 
that Avivas revised offer of £300 is fair and in line with other awards made by this service in 
similar situations.
So, I agree that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld. But, like our investigator I consider that Avivas revised offer of settlement is fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
Putting things right
Aviva should pay Mr M £300 for the trouble and upset he has been caused by this.
Aviva should pay 8% yearly simple interest on the compensation for late payment of the 
funds to Mr Ms new scheme from the  date of payment to the date of settlement, less any 
tax lawfully deductible.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ms complaint  and order Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited to put things right as 
set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 May 2021.
