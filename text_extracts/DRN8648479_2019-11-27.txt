K821x#15complaint
Mrs M says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny lent to her irresponsibly. 
She says that the checks the business made  before lending were  insufficient. She thinks  that 
if Sunny  had made better  checks it wouldve seen that she couldnt afford the loan 
repayments and so it wouldnt have lent to her. 
background

September 2017 and March 2018. A summary  of Mrs M borrowing, based  on the information

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that Sunny  was wrong to lend 
loans 4 to 9. This was because he thought it was evident that Mrs M was having  problems  
managing her money and that Sunny shouldve seen this and not lent to her. 
Sunny agrees that it shouldnt  have  approved  loans  5 to 7, and loan 9. But overall it said that 
its checks were  proportionate. It said it asked Mrs M about her income and expenditure 
which included her financial  commitments  and other short term lending. Mrs M agreed with 
the adjudicators  findings. 
So as no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed  to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs M could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
Ref: DRN86484792mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ms complaint. And Ive decided  to uphold Mrs Ms 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Mrs M accepted our adjudicators opinion about  loans  1 to 3. And Sunny has agreed that it 
shouldnt have approved loans 5 to 7, and loan 9. Because  of this I dont think there  is any 
ongoing disagreement about these  loans. So I wont be fully commenting on this lending. But 
they were part of the borrowing relationship Mrs M had with Sunny. So they are something I 
will take into account when considering  the other loans she took.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 4 and 8 would most likely have 
shown that Mrs M was having  problems managing her money.  
Our adjudicators have  provided detailed reasoning as to why this is, so Ill be brief here.  But 
when Mrs M took loan 4 she hadnt repaid loans 1 to 3. So the repayments  she was making  
to Sunny were now relatively high at over £300 per month. And Mrs M had been borrowing 
and repaying significant  amounts to other short term lenders over the same  period of time 
she was borrowing form Sunny. At the time she took loan 4 she owed around £800  to other 
short term lenders.  
Going forward Mrs Ms situation didnt improve. She continued to borrow from other short  
term lenders over the time she took loans 5 to 9. And at times she would take out and repay  
close to £2,000 per month in other short term lending.  So, Mrs M was, overall, already 
spending at times far more than her income when  she took these loans from Sunny. 
Ref: DRN86484793I think that Sunny wouldve found  out this information if it had made proportionate checks.  
And I think Sunny wouldve seen  Mrs M wouldnt have  been able repay  the loans in a 
sustainable way. So I think that Sunny shouldnt have given loans 4 and 8 to Mrs M and I 
think shes lost out as a result of this. So, overall, I think Mrs Ms complaint should be upheld 
about loans 4 to 9. 
Our adjudicator thought that the length of time and frequency of the loans was enough to 
uphold the complaint itself after loan 4. I dont agree this is the case here as the length of 
time Mrs M had a lending  relationship with Sunny wasnt long enough to make it think that a 
pattern of dependency  had emerged. But these loans were  not affordable for Mrs M in any 
event. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs M paid on loans  4 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 to 9 from Mrs Ms credit  file;
If Mrs M still owes Sunny any of the principal balance she borrowed on loans 5 and 8 Sunny  
should remove all the interest and charges applied to the outstanding balance. Sunny  should  
then re-work the account as if all payments made by Mrs M went to towards the principal. 
But importantly, Sunny needs to make sure that Mrs M doesnt repay more than the principal 
amount borrowed.  
If after doing this Mrs M hasnt repaid the principal  she borrowed Sunny can deduct  this from 
the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mrs M has already paid enough  to repay  the principal 
then any overpayment should be refunded to her with 8% simple* interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement
And if Sunny no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any deductions for it 
from the amount  it needs to pay Mrs M.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mrs Ms complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mrs M to accept 
or reject my decision before 27 December 2019.
