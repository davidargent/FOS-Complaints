K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  irresponsibly  
lent to him. 
background
Between October 2016 and October 2018, Mr C borrowed 20 loans from Sunny. For 
completeness, the lending  history  is set out in full in the appendix to this decision. There was 
a gap of over six months between Mr C repaying loan 4 and taking out loan 6. There  were  
almost 11 months between him applying for loan 5 and loan 6. From the information before 
me, it appears that loans 17 to 20 are still outstanding. 
Sunny offered to settle the complaint by writing off the balance in respect  of loans 17 to 20 
as a gesture of goodwill.  Mr C did not agree with that proposal  and so the matter was 
considered by our adjudicator. She thought the complaint should be upheld in respect  of 
loans 5, 9 and 11 to 20. 
Sunny did not agree  with that view and it reiterated its previous offer.  Another  of our 
adjudicators looked at the matter. He said that he thought that Sunny had not done anything 
wrong in respect  of loans 1 to 10, but the complaint should be upheld in respect  of loans 11 
to 20. 
The matter  has now been passed to me to make  a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. 
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
Ref: DRN54558162There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.  In doing so, I think  there were two 
separate chains  of lending in this matter.  The first chain is from loan 1 to 5 and the second 
chain is from loan 6 to 20. The reason there are two chains is that there was a significant  
break between loans 5 and 6. 
Turning first to the first chain, I know that our first adjudicator  thought that the complaint 
should be upheld  in respect  of loan 5. For loans 1 to 4, I think Sunny was entitled to rely on 
the information Mr C gave it. I can see that it asked for details about his income and 
expenditure and from the figures  that were provided,  it would  have reasonably appeared that 
the loan repayments were  sustainably affordable. 
By loan 5, I think Sunny should  have  probably  asked more  questions about Mr Cs financial 
circumstances. I say that because this was the fifth loan Mr C had taken out in less than two 
months. But from the evidence before me, I havent seen anything to suggest that Sunnys 
decision to lend would have reasonably been different even if it undertook a full review  of 
Mr Cs financial  circumstances.  
Looking now at the second  chain  of lending, again, I think  for loans 6 to 9, Sunny was again  
entitled to rely on the information  Mr C provided to it. Even  though Mr C had more  than one 
outstanding loan at the same time, but the repayments would have still appeared affordable. 
By loan 10, Sunny  should have probably  asked  more  questions about Mr Cs finances. But 
even if it had done so, the evidence doesnt suggest that its lending decision would have 
been different.  
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of the borrowing history  with a view to seeing if there 
was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. In that situation, Sunny  should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
11. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr C was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably and that it was most likely he was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
Ref: DRN54558163repaying his previous loan was leaving in his/her finances. By this point, his 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Loan 6 (which is the first loan in the second chain) was for £100 and loan 11 was also for 
£100. At this point  Sunny ought to have known  that Mr C was not likely borrowing to 
meet a temporary  shortfall in his income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  20 was taken  
out just under a year after loan 6. And it was for the same  amount. Mr C had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 11 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number  of loans Mr C borrowed were likely to have had negative  implications  on his 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 11 to 20. Sunny will need  to take action to 
put things right. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr C loans 11 to 20. 
I understand that loans 17 to 20 are outstanding. If that is the case  and Sunny has sold 
those outstanding debts, it must buy them back and then take the following steps. If it is 
unable to buy back those  debts, it must liaise  with the new debt owner  to achieve the results 
set out below: 
a)Sunny  must add together  the total of the repayments Mr C made towards  interest, fees 
and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance,  not including anything it 
has already refunded;  
b)Sunny  must calculate 8%* simple interest on the individual payments made by Mr C 
which were considered as part of paragraph  (a) above. Interest must be calculated  from 
the date Mr C originally made  the payments to the date the complaint is settled;
c)Sunny  must remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans and treat any repayments  made by Mr C as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr C having made 
overpayments, Sunny should refund those overpayments  with 8% simple interest* 
calculated from the date the overpayments  would have arisen to the date the complaint 
is settled. It must  then refund the amounts  set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) and then 
move to step (e); 
d)If there  is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts  calculated  in (a) and (b) should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on the outstanding loans and any principal 
Sunny has already  written-off. If this results in a surplus, then that surplus must be paid 
to Mr C. If there is still an outstanding  balance,  Sunny must agree an affordable  
repayment plan with Mr C. It must  not pursue an outstanding balance of principal  it has 
already written off. 
Ref: DRN54558164e)The overall pattern  of borrowing for loans 11 to 20 means that any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. Sunny must remove these  loans entirely from Mr Cs credit file. It 
does not have to remove  loans 17 to 20 until they have been repaid, but it must still 
remove any adverse information  recorded  about them.  
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. It must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax has been  deducted, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr Cs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International must put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 April 2020.
