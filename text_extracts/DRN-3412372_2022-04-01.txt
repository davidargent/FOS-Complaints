The complaint
Ms H complains about four loans provided to her by Madison CF UK Limited, trading as
118 118 Money, (118 118), which she says were unaffordable. The complaint is brought to 
this service on Ms Hs behalf by a claims management company. But for ease, I shall refer 
below to all actions being taken by Ms H.
What happened
118 118 agreed four loans for Ms H between June 2017 and December 2018. Loans 2 to 4 
were each used to repay the previous loan. According to the most recent information Ive 
seen, Loan 4 hasnt been repaid. The balance on Loan 4 was sold to a third party (T). 
Some of the information 118 118 provided about the loans is shown in the table below.

4. 30/12/2018 Unpaid £2,258.25 £176.07 24
Ms H says that at the time of entering into these credit agreements, she was experiencing 
financial difficulties. Had any enquiries been conducted by 118 118 into affordability or       
Ms Hs creditworthiness, this would have been discovered. As a result, Ms H believes that 
the decisions to lend to her were irresponsible.
In its final response letter, 118 118 upheld Ms Hs complaint about Loan 4. It said that in full 
and final settlement of the complaint, as Ms H had overpaid £48.17, it would refund this 
amount to her together with 8% interest which it calculated as 15 pence before the deduction 
of tax. It also said it would remove any negative information from Ms Hs credit file. 118 118 
was satisfied that it had acted correctly in approving the loan applications for Loans 1 to 3 
and as such it wasnt upholding this aspect of Ms Hs complaint.
Our adjudicators view
Our adjudicator said she wouldnt investigate Loan 4 as this had been upheld by 118 118. 
She recommended that the complaint about Loans 2 and 3 be upheld. With regard to      
Loan 1, she noted that Ms Hs income was around £2,100 and her monthly expenditure was 
around £1,215. 118 118s credit check showed that Ms Hs credit commitments were slightly 
higher than shed declared. But it wouldve still appeared that Loan 1 was affordable. In 
addition, looking at the results of the credit checks, she hadnt seen anything that was likely 
to have raised concerns about Ms H meeting her repayments. Based on this information, 
she didnt think it wouldve been reasonable for 118 118 to verify the information Ms H had 
provided to it.
With regard to Loans 2 and 3, she said that Ms H confirmed her circumstances were similar 
to when she applied for Loan 1. But as Loan 2 was taken around six months after Loan 1 
and Loan 3 was taken around six months after Loan 2, it shouldve raised concerns that so 
many loans were taken in such a short period of time. The adjudicator could also see that 
Ms H was also seeking credit from other high cost loan companies. Based on the information    
118 118 had, she thought it wouldve been evident that Ms H might have become dependent 
on high cost credit and she didnt think it was suitable to continue offering Ms H any further 
borrowing.
118 118 responded to the adjudicators view by asking her to expand on her reasons for 
upholding Loans 2 and 3 which she did. She said with regard to Loan 2, that it appeared that 
Ms H had become dependent on high cost credit and her credit repayments (including     
Loan 2) represented a significant proportion of her income. With regard to Loan 3, the 
adjudicator thought that Ms H was displaying a clear reliance on this type of borrowing.
118 118 didnt provide any further response.
As this complaint wasnt resolved informally, it was passed to me, as an ombudsman, to 
review and resolve. 
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Ms H
and to 118 118 on 3 March 2022. I summarise my findings:
As 118 118 had upheld Ms Hs complaint about Loan 4, I said I wouldnt investigate this 
loan. But I would include the redress for this loan in my award as I didnt know whether it had 
yet been actioned.
I noted that when 118 118 lent Loans 1 to 3 to Ms H, the regulator was the Financial 
Conduct Authority and relevant regulations and guidance included its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC). 
Its rules and guidance obliged 118 118 to lend responsibly. As set out in CONC, this meant 
that 118 118 needed to take reasonable and proportionate steps to assess whether or not a 
borrower could afford to meet their loan repayments in a sustainable manner over the 
lifetime of the agreement. 
Repaying debt in a sustainable manner meant being able to meet repayments out of normal 
income while meeting normal outgoings and not having to borrow further to meet those 
repayments.
The lender was required to carry out a borrower focussed assessment each time - 
sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or affordability check. Neither the 
law nor the FCA specified what level of detail was needed to carry out an appropriate 
assessment or how such an assessment was to be carried out in practice. The FCA said that 
the level of detail would depend on the type of product, the amount of credit being 
considered, the associated cost and risk to the borrower relative to the borrowers financial 
situation, amongst other factors.
The checks had to be borrower focussed  so 118 118 had to think about whether Ms H 
could sustainably repay her loans. In practice this meant that the lender had to ensure that 
making the payments to the loans wouldnt cause Ms H undue difficulty or adverse 
consequences. In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 to simply think about the 
likelihood of it getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of loan repayments on 
Ms H. In general, Id have expected a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential 
risk to the borrower of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for 
example, Id have expected a lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed 
checks
- the lower a borrowers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
- the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
- the longer the period of time a borrower would be indebted for (reflecting the fact that 
the total cost of credit was likely to be greater and the borrower was required to make 
repayments for an extended period);
- the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time during 
which a person was given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing might 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable). 
Bearing all of this in mind, in coming to a decision on Ms Hs complaint, Id considered the 
following questions:
- Did 118 118 complete reasonable and proportionate checks when assessing    
Ms Hs loan applications to satisfy itself that she would be able to repay the loans 
in a sustainable way? If not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks 
have shown?
- Did 118 118 make fair lending decisions?
Did 118 118 carry out reasonable and proportionate checks when it provided the loans?
Loan 1
118 118 provided Ms H with Loan 1 in June 2017. The interest rate was 71.42%, (99.9% 
APR). The loan was to be repaid by 24 monthly repayments of £76.94. Ms H told the lender 
that the loan was to be used for home furnishings. If Ms H made each payment when it was 
due, shed pay £1,846.56 in total. The loan was repaid from the proceeds of Loan 2.
118 118 gathered some information from Ms H about her income and expenses before it 
agreed the loan. It also carried out a credit check. 
Ms H told 118 118 she lived with her partner and had one dependent. Her annual income 
was £21,000, her living costs were £1,066 and her credit commitments were £150.  
Id calculated that Ms Hs net monthly income after tax and national insurance was around 
£1,463. Ms H provided some bank statements from 2017 to this Service and I could see that 
Ms Hs actual net monthly income during 2017 ranged from £1,041 to £1,436.
I couldnt see that 118 118 had asked for evidence of Ms Hs income and living costs. I 
thought it would have been proportionate for 118 118 to have taken steps to verify Ms Hs 
actual income and expenditure in line with CONC 5.3.1(4).
 
CONC 5.3.1(4) said:
If a firm takes income or expenditure into account in its creditworthiness assessment or its 
assessment required under CONC 5.2.2R (1):
1. (a) the firm should take account of actual current income or expenditure and reasonably 
expected future income or expenditure (to the extent it is proportionate to do so) where it 
is reasonably foreseeable that it would differ from actual current income or expenditure 
over the anticipated repayment period of the agreement;
2. (b) it is not generally sufficient for a firm to rely solely for its assessment of 
the customer's income and expenditure, on a statement of those matters made by 
the customer;
Id also reviewed 118 118s credit checks. Id noted that these showed that Ms H had seven 
active credit accounts with a £12,193 total balance. There were no payday loans. But Ms H 
had two loans on which her total monthly payments were £281. She also had two credit 
cards with a total balance of £937. So, she needed to make monthly minimum payments on 
these two accounts totalling around £47. Id also noted that one of Ms Hs credit card 
balances exceeded the cards credit limit two months before the loan application and shed 
taken out a cash advance on it in the month prior to the loan application. I thought all this 
might have concerned 118 118.
I also thought 118 118 was likely to have seen from its checks that Ms Hs spending on 
credit commitments was more than double the amount shed declared to 118 118 at around 
£328. And if her declared outgoings were added to this amount, 118 118 was likely to have 
seen from the information it held that Ms H didnt have enough disposable income to repay 
its loan. So, I thought Ms H would have needed a larger disposable income for the loan to be 
sustainable. And, I didnt think 118 118 had made a fair lending decision to provide Loan 1 to 
her.
Loan 2
118 118 provided Ms H with Loan 2 in January 2018, just seven months after Loan 1. The 
loan was for £1,581.97. 118 118 used £831.97 from the loan proceeds to repay Loan 1 and 
Ms H received £750. The interest rate was 71.09%, (99.9% APR). The loan was to be repaid 
by 24 monthly repayments of £121.46. If Ms H made each payment when it was due, shed 
pay £2,915.04 in total. The loan was repaid from the proceeds of Loan 3.
118 118 again gathered some information from Ms H about her income and expenses before 
it agreed the loan. It also carried out a credit check. 
Ms Hs personal circumstances appeared to have changed. She told 118 118 she was single 
and had no dependents. Her monthly income was shown as £2,200, her living costs were 
£980, and her credit commitments were £230.  I thought 118 118 might have queried the 
change in Ms Hs income and circumstances. But I couldnt see any information about this. I 
also thought 118 118 should have taken steps to verify Ms Hs income and expenditure in 
line with CONC 5.3.1(4).
Id reviewed 118 118s credit checks. Id noted that these showed that Ms H had 11 active 
credit accounts and three accounts had been opened in the previous six months. There was 
a total credit balance of £14,675. In addition to the loans and credit cards shown in the 
checks before Loan 1, Ms H had taken a new loan just two weeks before her application for 
Loan 2. This was for £2,130 with monthly payments of £74. Shed also taken a new credit 
card around six weeks before her loan application for Loan 2 and had a £325 balance on 
this. Shed also taken cash advances totalling £100 in the previous month on that card. Ms H 
had also taken out another new credit card around four months prior to the loan application 
and the balance of £373 was near the credit limit of £400. The balances on Ms Hs existing 
two credit cards were also near their respective credit limits. I thought all this might have 
concerned 118 118. Ms Hs credit balances were increasing, shed taken out three new accounts recently including the new loan for £2,130 just two weeks prior to her loan 
application, three of her credit cards were near their respective credit limits and she was 
having to take cash advances with her credit card. I thought all this suggested that Ms Hs 
finances were under pressure. 
At the very least I would have reasonably expected 118 118 to have taken steps to verify  
Ms Hs actual monthly expenditure to gain a more thorough understanding of her financial 
position in order to satisfy itself that she could sustainably repay Loan 2. 118 118 didnt say 
that it took steps to do this.
So overall, I didnt think the checks 118 118 had carried out on this occasion were 
reasonable and proportionate. Ms H was entering into an expensive loan and her finances in 
its credit check were showing signs of possible strain. 118 118 was required to establish 
whether Ms H could make her loan repayments without experiencing adverse consequences 
and not just to ascertain whether the loan repayments were technically affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation. It could have done this by, for example, requesting bank 
statements from Ms H, asking for copies of bills and/or receipts for her expenses and by 
asking her for more information about her existing credit commitments. 118 118 didnt say 
that it took steps to do this.
Although I didnt think that 118 118 had carried out reasonable and proportionate checks 
before Loan 2, that in itself didnt mean that Ms Hs complaint about Loan 2 should succeed. 
I also needed to be persuaded that what I considered to be proportionate checks would have 
shown 118 118 that Ms H couldn't repay Loan 2 sustainably. 
What would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown? 
Ms H had provided this Service with some bank statements from around the time of her  
application for Loan 2. I wasnt suggesting that these were the checks that 118 118 should 
have done. But I thought looking at these gave me the best picture of what the lender should 
have seen. In the absence of anything else from 118 118 showing what this information 
would have shown, I thought it was perfectly fair, reasonable and proportionate to place 
considerable weight on the statements as an indication of what Ms Hs financial 
circumstances were more likely than not to have been at the time. Had it sought some 
verification of Ms Hs spending, I thought 118 118 wouldve been in a better position to 
understand Ms Hs financial situation before it decided to lend to her. 
Id reviewed Ms Hs bank statements for the two months before Ms Hs application for    
Loan 2. Ms Hs monthly income varied between £1,429 and £1,436 and so was substantially 
lower than shed declared. And the total of Ms Hs living costs and credit commitments 
appeared to be significantly higher than her income. Overall, I could see that Ms Hs financial 
circumstances appeared to be strained. Her current account (with no overdraft arrangement) 
was almost overdrawn on several occasions. And on 21 December 2017, shed borrowed a 
high cost loan for £2,000 to support her income. 
I thought that if 118 118 had made additional checks, it was likely to have seen that there 
was a significant risk that Ms H wouldnt have been able to sustainably repay Loan 2. It 
seemed to me there was a risk that Ms H would need to borrow to meet her repayments on 
this loan, as she had recently been doing for her existing costs. I thought 118 118 would 
likely have realised that Ms H was having difficulty managing her finances. And I didnt think 
further checks would have provided any assurance that she could repay the loan 
sustainably. So, I didnt think that 118 118 had made a fair lending decision when it agreed to lend to her as it was likely that agreeing more credit for her would simply add to her debt 
levels.
Loan 3
118 118 provided Ms H with Loan 3 in July 2018, just six months after Loan 2. The loan 
amount for Loan 3 was almost £500 higher than Ms Hs previous loan and her monthly 
repayments had increased by around £37. I thought 118 118 ought to have been concerned 
about Ms Hs need to borrow again for the third time in 13 months. The loan was for 
£2,054.42. 118 118 used £1,354.42 from the loan proceeds to repay Loan 2 and Ms H 
received £700. The interest rate was 71.3%, (99.9% APR). The loan was to be repaid by    
24 monthly repayments of £158.84. If Ms H made each payment when it was due, shed pay 
£3,812.16 in total. The loan was repaid from the proceeds of Loan 4.
118 118 again gathered some information from Ms H about her income and expenses before 
it agreed the loan. This appeared to be the same as the information it had gathered before 
Loan 2. Again, I thought 118 118 ought to have taken steps to verify Ms Hs income and 
expenses in line with CONC 5.3.1(4). 
118 118 had also carried out a credit check. Id reviewed the credit report and could see that 
Ms H had ten active accounts and her total credit balance had reduced to £12,746. Ms Hs 
revolving credit had reduced by over £1,000. It appeared that some of the balances had 
been repaid in the month prior to the loan application. But two months prior to the 
application, three of Ms Hs credit card accounts were over their respective credit limits and 
on two of the cards, payments had recently been missed. So, I thought the checks still 
suggested that Ms Hs finances were under pressure. And in view of the fact that Loan 3 was 
Ms Hs third loan in 13 months from 118 118 and her loan balance and monthly payments 
were increasing, I didnt think its checks were sufficient to get a clear picture of Ms Hs 
finances at the time and for 118 118 to be confident that Ms H could repay the loan 
sustainably.  
Wed received Ms Hs bank statements for the period 21 June 2018 to 20 September 2018 
from her. Id looked at these to see what 118 118 was likely to have seen if it had made 
better checks. Although Id not seen the whole months transactions before Loan 3, I could 
see from the statements Id reviewed that Ms Hs financial situation didnt appear to have 
improved. Her monthly income of £1,385 wasnt sufficient to meet her regular expenses and 
credit commitments. So, again I thought there was a significant risk that Ms H wouldnt have 
been able to sustainably repay the loan and further credit was likely to add to her 
indebtedness. I didnt think further checks would have provided any assurance that she 
could repay Loan 3 sustainably. So, I didnt think that 118 118 had made a fair lending 
decision when it agreed to lend Loan 3 to her.
I could see that Ms H had continued to borrow high cost credit shortly after taking out     
Loan 3. Within four weeks, shed taken out another high cost loan for £1,500, and I thought 
this was foreseeable.
So, I thought 118 118 should reasonably have concluded that it treated Ms H unfairly when it 
agreed to lend Loans 1 to 3 to her. And, subject to any further representations by Ms H or 
118 118, I intended to uphold Ms Hs complaint about Loans 1 to 3. As 118 118 upheld      
Ms Hs complaint about Loan 4 in its final response letter, my proposed award also included 
our usual directions for that loan in case these hadnt yet been actioned. 
Putting things right  what 118 118 needs to doI understand that Loan 1 was repaid from the proceeds of Loan 2, Loan 2 was repaid from 
the proceeds of Loan 3, Loan 3 was repaid from the proceeds of Loan 4 and that Loan 4 
hasnt been fully repaid. In order to put Ms H back into the position she would have been had                
Loans 1 to 4 not been agreed for her, 118 118 needs to ensure that Ms H only repays the 
total amount of money she received as a result of having been given Loans 1 to 4. So,     
118 118 needs to:
1. Add up the total amount of money Ms H received as a result of having been given   
Loans 1 to 4. For the avoidance of doubt this added up amount should not include 
any interest, charges, document or any other administration fees;
2. The payments Ms H made (to Loans 1 to 4) should be deducted from this amount;
3. Any payments made, if any, after the total amount repaid exceeds the amount of 
money Ms H was given should be treated as overpayments and refunded to Ms H;
4. Interest at 8% per year simple should be paid on any overpayments made, if they 
were, from the date they were paid by Ms H to the date of settlement;*
5. If the total amount of money paid by Ms H doesnt exceed the total amount of money 
she received as a result of having been given Loans 1 to 4 (and for the avoidance of 
doubt any outstanding balance shouldnt include any interest, charges and document 
or other administration fees), 118 118 should treat Ms H positively and 
sympathetically regarding repayment of the balance. This might mean agreeing a 
mutually agreeable repayment plan with her; and
6. Remove any adverse information recorded on Ms Hs credit file as a result of           
Loans 1 to 4; 
As 118 118 has sold the outstanding debt on Loan 4 to T, it should buy it back if it is able to 
do so or chooses to do so and then take the steps listed above. If 118 118 isnt able to buy 
the debt back or chooses not to, then it should liaise with T to bring about steps 1. to 6. 
above.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 must 
give Ms H a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one. 
Neither Ms H nor 118 118 has responded to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry
practice at the time.
Given that Ms H and 118 118 have given me nothing further to consider, I see no
reason to depart from the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. It follows that I
uphold this complaint and require 118 118 to take the steps set out above under the heading
Putting things right - what 118 118 needs to do.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement of this complaint, I 
order Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 Money, to put things right as Ive set out 
above under the heading Putting things right  what 118 118 needs to do.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 April 2022.
