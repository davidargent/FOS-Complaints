The complaint
Mr S complains that MBNA Limited wont refund to him the full amount that he paid for a stay 
in a hotel. Hes being helped with his complaint by his partner.
What happened
Mr S used his MBNA credit card in November 2019 to pay Â£689.70 to a holiday company for 
a hotel booking in a ski resort that started in December 2019. He contacted MBNA in 
January 2020 and requested that a chargeback be made for the cost of the hotel as it had 
been misrepresented to him. He says that he was told that a chargeback wasnt possible as 
the service was provided and not cancelled but that his claim would be considered under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
MBNA then said that section 75 covers any financial loss that has been incurred as a result 
of a breach of contract or misrepresentation and, although there had been a 
misrepresentation, Mr S hadnt evidenced that hed suffered a financial loss as a result  but 
it offered to refund 10% of the amount that Mr S had paid for the hotel booking. Mr S asked it 
to increase the refund to 50% and it agreed to do so in June 2020. It said that it felt that 10% 
wasnt enough for the experience as a whole and that the service from MBNA could have 
been better.
Mr S wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. He questioned whether 
this should have been dealt with as a chargeback, whether MBNA should have sought to 
recover the costs from the hotel because the distance to the ski lifts was wrong on its 
website and, given that MBNA had admitted that there had been a mis-representation, 
whether its right for it to only refund 50%. He said that he would like the other 50% to be 
refunded to him and some compensation.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ss complaint should be upheld. He didnt feel 
that MBNA had acted unreasonably in raising a section 75 claim, rather than requesting a 
chargeback. He said that the holiday company did make a misrepresentation on its website 
but he was unable to say that this would have stopped Mr S from booking the 
accommodation. MBNA had offered to refund 50% of the cost of accommodation due to the 
customer service he had received and the misrepresentation about the accommodation and 
he felt that that was a fair way to resolve Mr Ss complaint.
Mr Ss partner, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. She has responded in detail and has provided detailed evidence which she 
says shows that Mr S wouldnt have booked the accommodation if it hadnt been 
misrepresented  she says that proximity to the ski lifts is essential when booking ski 
accommodation and that the supplier is still misrepresenting the distance from the hotel to 
the ski lifts on its website. She says that they used some of the very poor services provided 
by the hotel merely because they were stuck in the resort and had nowhere else to go 
without paying to move. She says that they used as few of the services as possible and ate 
most lunches and dinners out because the food was so poor and that the only service they 
used was to sleep there at night because they had nowhere else to go. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
if a consumer disputes a card payment, the card issuer may be able to make a 
chargeback claim to the merchant under the relevant card scheme to try to settle the 
dispute  but theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be 
made;
MBNA said that the service was provided to Mr S so it didnt consider that a 
chargeback would be successful and that his claim would be considered under 
section 75;
I dont consider that there was any requirement for MBNA to make a chargeback 
claim for Mr Ss disputed payment and I consider it to be more likely than not that any 
chargeback claim would have been defended by the supplier as Mr S had used the 
hotel;
MBNA said that it would consider Mr Ss claim under section 75 and, as his claim met 
the requirements for a claim under section 75, I consider that it was fair and 
reasonable for it to do so;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ss complaint about MBNA, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company and that 
MBNAs response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im 
not determining the outcome of Mr Ss claim under section 75 as only a court would 
be able to do that;
Mr Ss partner has described in detail the distance from the hotel to the ski lifts and 
shes provided detailed evidence to show that Mr S wouldnt have booked that hotel if 
the distance from the hotel to the ski lifts hadnt been misrepresented on the holiday 
companys website;
I consider it to be more likely than not that the hotel was further from the ski lifts than 
was described on the holiday companys website and I consider that to have been a 
misrepresentation by the holiday company for which MBNA is liable under section 75;
but that misrepresentation doesnt mean that MBNA should refund to Mr S the full 
amount that he paid for the hotel booking as the cost of the hotel booking was for 
more than the location of the hotel and Mr S and his partner were able to use the 
hotel and the services that it provided;
Mr Ss partner has also described their issues with the services provided by the hotel 
but those services were available for them to use and it was their choice not to use 
them;
assessments of the quality of a hotel and the services that it provides can be very 
subjective and, though its clear that Mr S and his partner didnt consider the location 
of the hotel and the services that the hotel provided to be acceptable, MBNA has 
provided information about the hotel from a travel website which shows that more 
than 90% of contributors rated the hotel as either excellent or very good  and no 
contributors rated it worse than average;when Mr S complained in resort to the holiday company about the hotel it offered him 
alternative accommodation  but he didnt accept that because it was even further 
away from the ski lifts;
when Mr S complained to MBNA it offered to refund to refund 10% of the amount that 
hed paid for the hotel booking  but it then agreed to increase the refund to 50% - 
which was the refund that Mr S had requested  as it felt that 10% wasnt enough for 
the experience as a whole and that its service could have been better;
I consider that MBNAs offer to refund 50% of the cost of the hotel booking was a fair 
and reasonable response to the holiday companys misrepresentation about the 
distance from the hotel to the ski-lifts, any breach of contract by the holiday company 
because of the issues that Mr S and his partner had with the hotel, and the issues 
with the way that MBNA had dealt with his claim;
I sympathise with Mr S and his partner for the issues that they had with the location 
of the hotel and the services that it provided, but Im not persuaded that it would be 
fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require MBNA to refund to Mr S 
more than the 50% of the cost of the hotel booking that it has already offered to him; 
and
if it hasnt already done so, I consider that MBNA should refund to Mr Ss credit card 
account the 50% of the cost of the hotel booking that it has already offered to him, 
but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require it to pay him any other 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that, if it hasnt already done so, MBNA Limited should refund to Mr Ss credit 
card account the 50% of the cost of the hotel booking that it has offered to him.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2021.
