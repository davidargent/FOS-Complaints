 Mr F says that the lending was irresponsible.
Sunny says that before providing the loans it carried out credit  worthiness and affordability 
checks. Based on these  it was considered responsible to lend to Mr F. 
Our adjudicator upheld  this complaint in regard to loans two to 19. He didnt think  he had 
enough evidence  to say that loan one or loans 20 and 21 (the loans in the second lending  
chain) shouldnt  have been  provided.
Sunny didnt accept  our adjudicators view so this case has been passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to issue a decision. 
Ref: DRN33031282my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr F could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent the repayment amounts and the 
consumer's income  and expenditure.  With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr F could sustainably repay his loans - not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Fs complaint.
The first loan provided was a line of credit. I agree with our adjudicator that there  isnt 
enough evidence  to say this loan shouldnt have been provided. Mr F made a number of 
drawdowns on this loan. I think that Mr Fs frequency of drawdowns  suggested  he might be 
having difficulty managing his money  and while I can see the account was closed in 
December 2014,  an instalment loan for £750 was provided a few days later. Based  on Mr Fs 
borrowing history I think  that Sunny should have been concerned about how sustainable it 
was to provide  the second loan to Mr F.
Ref: DRN33031283By the time the third loan was provided,  I agree with our adjudicators comments  that Mr Fs 
overall pattern  of borrowing  suggested he had become  persistently  reliant  on short-term 
loans. Mr F had taken out three loans in nearly  twelve months with the first loan involving a 
number of drawdowns. I think that at this time Sunny should have realised that lending  to 
Mr F wasnt sustainably  affordable. Therefore I dont think  that the remaining loans in this 
lending chain (up to loan 19) should  have been  provided.
Although there were  some gaps between some of the loans in the first lending  chain, I dont 
think it would  have  been reasonable for Sunny  to conclude  these  were  any indication  that 
Mr Fs finances  had moved  on from whatever situation had required his previous  loans.
Mr F repaid loan 19 in April 2017,  and then didnt take out a new loan until December 2017. 
The amount  then borrowed in loans 20 and 21 were lower than the amounts generally 
borrowed in the previous  loans. Given the break in Mr Fs borrowing I find it reasonable to 
accept that loans 20 and 21 form part of a new lending  chain. Based on the information 
gathered before these two loans were  provided  I do not find I can say that there  is enough to 
say the loans shouldnt have been  provided.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading 
as Sunny) should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mr F paid on loans two to 19;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan two from Mr F's credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan three  means any information recorded about them 
is adverse. So all entries about  loans three  to 19 should be removed from Mr F's credit  
file
* HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit  International Limited to take off tax from 
this interest. Elevate  Credit International Limited must give Mr F a certificate  showing how 
much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 October  2019.
