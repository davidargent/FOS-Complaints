K820x#14complaint
Mr A has complained about a PPI policy sold to him by Lloyds Bank  PLC (Lloyds)  in
September 1991. He says he was told to have the policy  and wasnt told it was optional.
Hes not happy  with the dates Lloyds used in the redress calculation and the amount of
redress it has offered.
background
Mr A was self-employed as a restaurant  owner.  He has told us he was seeking an overdraft
facility for his business and was sold the policy  during a meeting in 1991. He says he was
told that if he didnt  take the PPI cover  called Commercial Overdraft Repayment Insurance
(CORI)  he wouldnt be granted the business  overdraft facility.  The CORI policies I have
seen provided  cover  for life and disability. Mr A later complained to Lloyds about the policy.
Lloyds first responded to Mr As complaint in May 2017 offering £342.14 using a policy  start
date of 16 August  2001 and an end date of 16 May 2003. It then wrote  again in August 2018
and made  a further offer of £3,132.92, this time using a start date for the policy  of
16 February 1994 and end date of 16 May 2003.
Mr A says the calculation  should start from September  1991, as evidenced by a letter Lloyds
sent to him in September  1991  and with reference to the bank statements hes provided.
Our adjudicator who considered the complaint thought that Lloyds should change  the
dates it used to make  the calculation for the redress. The adjudicator  said the start date 
should be October 1993 and the amounts Mr A paid for the policy should be what was 
reflected in his bank  statements. Lloyds  doesnt have all of the data about the cost of the 
policy premiums prior to September 2001. Our adjudicator thought it was reasonable for 
Lloyds to use assumptions for the missing data.
Lloyds recalculated the redress and offered Mr A a further £1,256.61 (and using an end date 
of January 2004). Our adjudicator put this to Mr A, but he wasnt  happy  with it.
In response, Mr A said that he had been  paying for life cover  since  1990 at a cost of £6.68
per month and was able to send us a copy of his policy. He referred to other debits shown
on his bank account of £23.30 per month which he said was for the PPI and which
evidenced an earlier start date than the date proposed by the adjudicator. He further referred
to Lloyds letter to him sent in September 1991 about his overdraft and him needing life
cover in order to be granted that overdraft.
As Mr A wasnt happy with the adjudicators opinion, the complaint was passed to me. I 
issued my provisional decision explaining that  and based on the limited  information 
available  what Lloyds  had already offered  to resolve the complaint seemed fair under the 
circumstances. But I asked both parties to give me anything further they wanted me to 
consider before I issued my final decision.  Heres what I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
After doing so Ive provisionally decided I wont be asking Lloyds to make  any further offer of
redress to Mr A. I know Mr A will be very disappointed with my provisional decision  he has
put a lot of time and effort into bringing his complaint  so Id like to explain why Ive reached
Ref: DRN82605432the decision that I have done.
the start date of the policy
I should first clarify that there is limited and/or conflicting information  available  for this
complaint and provided by the parties. Mr A has said the PPI started in 1991 and that he has
proved this with the records he has sent us. Lloyds cant be sure of the start date of the
policy and also has missing data for some  of the time the policy was running.
When I have a complaint  with limited information available it can be difficult  to be certain
about what happened. So, I have  to base my decision on what  I think  more  likely happened
bearing in mind the limited information  I have  and in the circumstances of that particular
complaint.
Mr A has given  us a copy of the letter that Lloyds  sent to him on 6 September 1991  about his
business overdraft  facility. And I note that it says about the overdraft 
I am prepared to do thisprovided we have  Life Cover for the overdraft
I am enclosing the Commercial Overdraft  Repayment Insurance form for your
signature and the overdraft limit will not operate until this is returned  to me
So, I can understand why Mr A thinks the redress should start from an earlier  date of 1991
as this is referred to in Lloyds letter at that time.  And Mr A has sent us a copy  of what  looks
likely to be the front page of a Commercial  Overdraft  Repayment  Insurance  document
headed Details of Insurance. The Nominated Person recorded, and which is written  by
hand, is Mr A and this is annotated also by hand  to say 15/09  sent  and next to that is what
looks like Mr As handwritten initials. So, again  I can understand Mr As conclusion that the
CORI policy would have  started shortly after that on the basis  that it looks like he returned
the document to Lloyds on 15 September 1991.
As already mentioned,  and in the light of missing data from Lloyds, Mr A has also referred  us
to his bank statements which  he says shows the policy was in place earlier  than 1993. The
earliest bank statement  he has given us is from 1991 and shows the payment of £6.68 which
Ive referred to above and relates  to a life policy Mr A took in 1990. Because  of this I am
satisfied that the £6.68 debit is for a different policy than the CORI policy  firstly because
Mr A has been able to show  us it started  in 1990 and second because  those  same  payments
continued to be made  after the payments to either  LBIS INSURANCE or LLOYDS
O/DRAFT INS which started later.
The next available statement Mr A has been  able to give us is from 1993  and as well as the
debit of £6.68 referred to above, it shows a standing order  payment of £23.80 payable to
LBIS INSURANCE on 18 January 1993.  And from the other statements Mr A has given us
this payment is made on a monthly  basis  until September 1993. In October 1993 a direct
debit of £36.75 is paid to LLOYDS O/DRAFT INS. Mr A says this change in payee  details  is
just the PPI payment being renamed on his bank statement.
However, from my experience, prior to 1993, a debit for a CORI policy  would show on a
customers bank statement as CORI and not LBIS INSURANCE.  So, this makes  me
question whether the payments being  made  prior to October  1993  were in fact not for a
CORI policy but some other  type of insurance.  LBIS stands for Lloyds Bank Insurance
Services but I cant know what this policy was for or what it covered.
Ref: DRN82605433What is clear from Mr As bank statements is that something happened  in October 1993
when the payment increased from £23.80 to £36.75 and the payee name changed from
LBIS INSURANCE to LLOYDS O/DRAFT INS.  But I think its more  likely that this change
indicates the start date of the CORI policy and that it wasnt in place earlier.
I appreciate that Mr A has shown us a copy of the letter  Lloyds sent to him in
September 1991 and it referred  to Mr A having  to complete a CORI application  form in order
for the overdraft agreement to be put in place as life cover was needed.  And as Ive said
above, Mr A has provided us with what looks to be the front page of the CORI application
which is annotated  by hand  as being sent on 15 September.
I cant know what actually happened, but in the absence of anything further, I think it is more
likely this particular application was sent on 15 September 1993 as this tallies  with the start
date of the debits  shown  on Mr As bank statements from October 1993 for the LLOYDS
O/DRAFT INS. And I think its more likely that this was the payment for the CORI policy.
However, I do accept that Mr A was paying  for some kind of insurance product with Lloyds
prior to that date and I cant know for certain if there was an amendment  to a then current
policy or that policy was stopped, and the CORI policy started. But without  further evidence,  I
dont have enough to safely say the CORI policy started prior to October 1993.
As Ive said above,  I know this will be disappointing for Mr A, but I hope Ive been able to
explain how Ive reached this provisional outcome. But if either party can provide me with
anything further,  I can reconsider  my conclusion in light of what  I receive.
the redress calculation
As Lloyds  has agreed to settle Mr As complaint,  I wont be looking at how the policy was
sold. I will be considering whether the offer Lloyds  has made to resolve Mr As complaint is
fair.
When a business  agrees  to settle  a PPI complaint, we expect  it to, as far as possible, put the
customer in the position  they would have been  in had they not taken out the PPI.
With PPI attached to an overdraft account this typically means a refund of all the premiums
charged for the PPI, any interest  charged on those PPI premiums, any fees/charges  directly
caused by the PPI and 8% simple interest to compensate the customer  for the time theyve
been without this money.
In Lloyds redress calculation it doesnt  have any data about how the account  was run before
September 2001. So, it has made reasonable assumptions of how much the account would
have been charged towards the PPI policy each month and it has assumed how much
interest would  have been charged because of those premiums. And from September  2001
from when Lloyds does  have the account  data, it has refunded what  it says the account was
charged for the PPI policy and the interest  charged  because of those premiums.
Lloyds initially used  a start date of August 2001  and later amended  their offer using as start
date of February 1994. Our adjudicator concluded that Lloyds  should  amend this further and
the start date should be from October  1993  using the statement evidence  provided by Mr A
and which  has resulted in the additional offer to Mr A of £1,256.61.
Ref: DRN82605434Lloyds didnt respond to my provisional  decision,  but Mr A did reply with further evidence.  
And as part of that reply Mr A detailed the time and expense that he had incurred in bringing 
and pursuing his complaint. Id like to thank Mr A for the additional information and evidence 
he has been able to give me and fully appreciate the effort  that he has made, but I wont be 
making a financial  award  for the trouble and upset caused to Mr A. 
I say this because  when a complaint about  a business does arise  it is inevitable that some 
inconvenience is caused, but we would expect a business to act fairly in trying  to resolve the 
complaint. It is a fact in this case that Lloyds  didnt have all of the information available  
which isnt surprising because of how long ago the policy was sold  to make an accurate 
redress calculation. But it did uphold Mr As complaint and offered to put the matter right 
based on the information it did have  and using assumptions for the missing data. So, while  I 
appreciate Mr A will be disappointed about  me not making an award, I hope he will be 
satisfied that as a result  of his efforts the new information he has been able to provide has 
caused a change in the outcome  for the redress calculation. 
The further information and evidence Mr A has been  able to provide in response to my 
provisional decision caused me to change my opinion about the correct start date of the 
policy for redress purposes.  Because of this I wrote  to both parties again with my updated  
findings in light of what Mr A had been able to provide. I said the following:
I issued my provisional decision about this complaint on 17 March 2021. In that provisional  
decision I explained that when I have limited  or conflicting information to consider I have to 
decide a complaint on what I think  more likely  happened.
I concluded that a start date for the redress calculation of October 1993, and the resulting 
offer made by Lloyds, seemed fair under the circumstances  of the complaint, based on the 
evidence I had seen.  I invited both parties  to provide me with any further information they 
wanted to consider by 17 April 2021.
I didnt receive anything from Lloyds, but Mr A has kindly  provided  me with more  evidence 
which I have now considered and currently is causing me to change my opinion on the 
fairest start date of the policy  and resulting calculation  of redress   that it should be from 
October 1991 (being the month following when it looks likely Mr A returned the Commercial 
Overdraft Repayment Insurance (CORI) document). But I explain my thinking in more  detail 
below.
In my provisional decision I referred to Lloyds letter of 6 September  1991 which confirmed 
the increase in Mr As overdraft to £14,000 but that CORI  cover  would be needed. We had a 
copy of the front page of the CORI document which is annotated  with what looks  like Mr As 
initials and there  is a hand-written sent date of 15/09. Prior to the new information provided 
by Mr A I didnt think this was more  likely  the start date.
But Mr A has now been able to give us a copy of a letter from Lloyds dated 31 August 1993. 
This confirms Lloyds agreed  to extend  the £17,000 overdraft facility on the business  account 
until 30 September 1993 pending Mr As commercial  mortgage with another provider. Lloyds 
also agreed to an unsecured overdraft of £2,000 upon completion  of the commercial 
mortgage. The letter goes  onto say there would be an arrangement fee of £25 and the 
£2,000 will need  to be protected by Commercial  Overdraft Repayment  Insurance of 2 Units. 
The present overdraft is also protected by Commercial Overdraft  Repayment 
Insurance and it will simply be a case  of amending the existing protection. 
Ref: DRN82605435So, it is now clear from this letter that a CORI policy was already in place at this point in 
August 1993.  Therefore, I now think its more likely September  1991  is the correct  start date 
of the policy. And for redress purposes this is the date (or rather  the following  month  for the 
first premium  to be paid) to be used as the correct start date of the redress calculations.
Following on from the correspondence  in August 1993, the next bank  statement  we have 
(number 160) shows a payment of £23.80  to LBIS  Insurance on 16 September  1993, which 
is what CORI cover for a £14,000 overdraft would cost at the rate of £1.70  per £1,000. So, I 
am satisfied  that is what was being paid as the existing protection. The statement from 
September 1993 shows an arrangement  fee of £25.00, which tallies  with what is said in the 
letter of August 1993.
The next bank  statement  (number 162) we have shows  a payment of £36.75 to Lloyds O/D 
ins on 25 October  1993  which  suggests the number of units  covered  by the CORI policy  has 
increased in line with the above correspondence in 1993. This monthly  premium  continues at 
this amount until it is reduced to £5.25 per month  on 19 May 1994 as the overdraft facility  
was reduced to £3,000. But we now know it later increased to 6 units  at a cost of £10.80  per 
month as evidenced  by a CORI certificate  Mr A has given us dated 5 September 1995 and 
which is the latest evidence we have  of the CORI premiums until Lloyds data is available in 
September 2001.
So, for redress purposes, based on the evidence now available  Lloyds  should  use a monthly  
cost of;
£23.80 from October 1991 until September 1993. 
This should then increase to £36.75 from October 1993 to April 1994. 
This should be reduced to £5.25 from May 1994  to August 1995 and then increased 
to £10.80 per month in September 1995.
and use a mid-point  range between  September 1995 and the known premium  data 
which starts in September 2001. 
Neither party responded to my changed opinion. 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party responded to my changed  opinion about this complaint  which updated my 
provisional decision  I see no reason  to alter what I said in my changed  opinion.
For completeness, Ill repeat what Lloyds needs  to do to put the matter right.
To put things right for the redress calculation -
Lloyds should  refund to Mr A the premiums he paid for the PPI policy and use a 
monthly premium cost of;
£23.80 from October 1991 until September 1993. 
This should then increase to £36.75 from October 1993 to April 1994. 
Ref: DRN82605436This should be reduced to £5.25 from May 1994  to August 1995 and then increased 
to £10.80 per month in September 1995.
Lloyds should  assume a monthly premium of £10.80 from September 1995 to 
September 1998 (the mid-point) and then £6.00 per month until September  2001. 
And then the known  data from September 2001 until the end date of the policy  which 
I understand to be January 2004. 
Interest should  be added to each premium  payment plus 8% simple interest for the 
time Mr A has been without the money*. 
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires Lloyds to take off tax from this interest.  Lloyds must  give Mr A a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr As complaint and Lloyds should update its redress  
calculations as outlined  above and taking into account any money,  if any, it may have 
already paid.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  by 23 July 2021.
