The complaint
Ms A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wrongly paid money to a joint account 
that she has no access to. Ms A would like to be reimbursed that money.
What happened
Ms A had a mortgage with NatWest. Ms A paid the mortgage by direct debit each month. 
The mortgage was redeemed on 28 February 2020. Ms As payments were collected each 
month by NatWest from Ms As bank. NatWest had the details of a joint account between Ms 
A and her former partner and requested those payments from the joint account. Although 
redemption was set for 28 February, a monthly payment would have been due on 2 March 
and NatWest requested the payment. That payment for £435.95 wasnt made from the joint 
account but from Ms As sole account. NatWest then returned the payment to the joint 
account. NatWest says that it was unaware that Ms A was making payments from her sole 
account.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld as NatWest hadnt 
acted unfairly by returning the money to the only account it was aware of. Ms A disagrees 
saying that NatWest could see that the money was coming from her sole account and as it 
made an error it should recall it. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know that Ms A feels strongly the injustice of this situation and would like us to rectify it. I 
should say that I have every sympathy for Ms A.  But I can only find for her if I was 
persuaded that NatWest had done something wrong. This is a situation where the only 
account NatWest was aware of since the inception of the mortgage was the account ending 
2668 and it returned the money to the account. There seems to have been a dispute 
between Ms A and her partner and Ms A no longer had access to that account. But from the 
evidence Ive looked at, NatWest was unaware of that. Ive simply no evidence that before 
this money was transferred back to the joint account in Ms As bank that either Ms A or her 
bank told NatWest that the money was coming from her sole account, 
At the end of February, NatWest requested the money from account ending 2668 but Ms As 
bank paid it from another account, Ms As sole account ending 2669. As I say there is no 
evidence that NatWest was aware of that when it returned the money or that there were any 
issues in it paying into the account ending 2668. So, when NatWest found it was overpaid 
£435.95 on the mortgage, it returned that money swiftly to the account that it had every 
reason to believe it originated from. I cant fairly say that it was doing anything wrong by 
doing that.
Although I have every sympathy for Ms A, as I say above, I can only find for her if NatWest 
had done something wrong and Im not persuaded that it did and so I cant fairly uphold this 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 March 2021.
