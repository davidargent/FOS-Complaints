K821x#15Complaint
Mr C says CashEuroNet UK LLC irresponsibly lent to him.
Background
I sent my provisional decision on 31 July 2019.  A copy of my provisional  decision is 
attached and forms part of this final decision.
My provisional decision sets out the background of this complaint. It explains why I thought 
Mr Cs complaint should be partially upheld. 
Mr Cs representative confirmed that he accepted the provisional decision.
CashEuroNet disagreed with the provisional  decision, and Ill go through what it said.
My findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
CashEuroNet argued that Mr C appeared to have  had enough disposable income  to afford  
loan 3. While  on a strict pounds and pence  basis this is true, as I explained in my provisional  
decision CashEuroNet was required to establish  whether Mr C could sustainably  repay  his 
loans. Mr C explained he was only able to make his repayments with help from family and by 
borrowing from other lenders. And given just how large loan 3 was in relation to Mr Cs 
income, I think it shouldve been clear  that it wasnt sustainably affordable.
CashEuroNet made a similar argument  that Mr C had enough disposable  income to repay 
loan 4. But just as before, it failed to take account of the costs of his other debts as revealed 
in the credit check. This left him with just £6 a month left over in his budget,  which was not 
nearly enough to say he could reliably  meet his repayments. Further, I explained in the 
provisional decision why from loan 4 onwards the main issue was that CashEuroNet  
shouldve realised that all further lending was unsustainable and not just that particular loan.
CashEuroNet also pointed out that Mr C had paid his loans  on time and didnt have any late 
fees, so it couldnt  have  known he was struggling  to make his repayments.  But as 
I explained in my provisional decision,  by loan 4 CashEuroNet  was aware that Mr C had 
substantial debt with other  lenders, that his debt repayments made  up the vast majority of 
his outgoings,  that he had been  borrowing from CashEuroNet consistently over a significant 
period, and that there were  very small gaps between  certain loans.
So while I acknowledge CashEuroNets point of view, I still think  it should not have  lent 
loan 3, and that it should  have realised from loan 4 onwards that it shouldnt have provided 
any further loans.
Putting things  right  what  CashEuroNet  needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 3 to 5 inclusive;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
Ref: DRN01206492remove any negative information  about loan 3 from Mr Cs credit file;
Mr Cs debt situation from loan 4 onwards means any information  recorded about 
these loans is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 4 and 5 should be removed from 
Mr Cs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires businesses  to take off tax from this interest. CashEuroNet must 
give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above and in my provisional decision, I partially uphold Mr Cs 
complaint about  CashEuroNet UK LLC.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right in the way I set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 September 2019.

Complaint
Mr C says CashEuroNet UK LLC irresponsibly lent to him.
Background
This complaint is about  four payday loans CashEuroNet provided to Mr C between March 2014 and 
April 2015 under  the trading name QuickQuid; and one high-cost  short-term instalment  loan it 
provided to him between May and August 2015 under the trading name  Pounds to Pocket. Mr Cs 
lending history  is as follows:
Our adjudicator partly  upheld Mr Cs complaint and thought the loans  from loan 3 onwards shouldnt  
have been given. CashEuroNet disagreed,  and so the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
My provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending  including  all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice   on our website. 
CashEuroNet needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt  lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make sure Mr C could repay  the 
loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could  take into account a number  of different  things, 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashEuroNet should  fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that CashEuroNet was required  to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  affordable 
on a strict pounds and pence calculation. Loan Date  opened Date  closedAmount

Ref: DRN01206494Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis  might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Office  of Fair Trading guidance on Irresponsible Lending,  and later, the Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC)  define sustainable as being without undue  difficulties  and in particular  
the customer  should  be able to make  repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Cs complaint. 
Like our adjudicator, I dont think  I have enough reason  to say that loans  1 or 2 were irresponsibly 
lent. For example,  these  loans  were not overly large compared to Mr Cs reported income  or his later 
reported expenditure, and he didnt  have a history of missed or late payments. He hadnt been 
borrowing from CashEuroNet for very long at that point,  and there was a relatively notable gap in time 
between Mr C paying  off loan 1 and taking out loan 2.
It may be that CashEuroNet should  have done more  in terms of checks  for loans 1 and 2. But based 
on what Mr C and his representative have told us so far and the evidence Ive got, Ive not seen 
enough to suggest that these loans  were unaffordable for Mr C. And I cant  say that proportionate 
checks would have revealed anything that shouldve led CashEuroNet to decline loan 1 or 2. 
With that said, I dont think CashEuroNet shouldve  lent loan 3 to Mr C. Loan 3s highest contractual 
repayment made up a significant proportion  of Mr Cs income, leaving him with relatively little to pay 
all his living costs, credit commitments, and any other costs that mightve come  up. So I dont think 
this loan was sustainably affordable, and I think  this wouldve  been clear  from a proportionate check, 
and from the check CashEuroNet did.
CashEuroNet pointed out that Mr C paid loan 3 on time. While I understand its argument, thats 
something it only knows in hindsight,  and didnt  know at the time it made the lending decision.  And 
Mr C has explained he was only able to pay his loans with help from family and by borrowing from 
other lenders  which Ill go on to talk about.
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of CashEuroNets lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there  was a point at which  CashEuroNet  should reasonably have seen  that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so CashEuroNet should have  realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 4. I say 
this because:
By the time Mr C asked for loan 4 hed been borrowing from CashEuroNet for a lengthy 
period and he wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed in short-term credit.  
Loan 4 was taken out a year after Mr Cs first. And while it was for a smaller  amount, his 
borrowing had only been increasing before  then,  and importantly CashEuroNet was aware 
that he had substantial debt elsewhere. Mr Cs debt repayments made  up the vast majority of 
his outgoings by that point. So by then,  it can be argued that Mr C had paid large  amounts of 
interest to effectively  service  a debt over an extended period.
While  Mr Cs normal outgoings technically left him with enough to make loan 4s repayments, 
once you factor in his other credit commitments he was left with just £6 in his monthly budget.  
I dont think thats nearly enough  disposable  income to say that Mr C could sustainably repay 
loan 4 in addition to his other credit commitments, let alone meet  any unexpected  costs that 
could come  up. And I think his spending on credit was a strong  indication that Mr C was stuck 
in an unsustainable  level of debt.
Ref: DRN01206495Loan  4 was taken out just six days after Mr C paid off the substantial  loan 3  a loan which  
Ive already argued wasnt sustainably  affordable.  And he took out loan 5 just six days  after 
paying off loan 4  and it was for twice the amount. Mr C was borrowing  regularly and 
consistently from CashEuroNet. So CashEuroNet ought to have realised it was more likely 
than not Mr C was having to borrow  further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was 
leaving in his finances,  and that Mr Cs indebtedness was continuing unsustainably.
I think  that Mr C lost out because CashEuroNet continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer amount  of short-term borrowing  was likely to have had negative implications on 
Mr Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im also upholding the complaint about loans  4 and 5, and CashEuroNet should put things right.
Putting things right   what CashEuroNet  needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans  3 to 5 inclusive;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loan 3 from Mr Cs credit file;
Mr Cs debt situation  from loan 4 onwards means any information recorded about these  loans 
is adverse. So all entries about  loans 4 and 5 should be removed from Mr Cs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires businesses to take off tax from this interest.  CashEuroNet must  give Mr C a 
certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My provisional decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I plan to partially uphold Mr Cs complaint,  and to direct  CashEuroNet 
UK LLC to put things  right in the way I set out above.
Please could  CashEuroNet and Mr C send me any more information or comments to look at by 14 
August 2019.  After that, Ill reconsider the case.
