*Dates as provided  in Uncle  Bucks final response  letter dated 30 May 2018.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ms complaint and thought the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Uncle Buck disagreed, although it accepted that loan 6 shouldnt 
have been given. It offered to settle the complaint by writing  off the balance on Mr Ms 
account, refunding  interest and charges on loan 6 (plus statutory interest)  and making a 
small compensation payment for the trouble and upset caused.
Mr M didnt  accept Uncle Bucks offer so the complaint has been  passed to me for a final 
decision.
Ref: DRN47011842my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending - including  all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Uncle Buck  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Uncle Buck should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Uncle Buck  was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Our adjudicator said she didnt think it was unreasonable for Uncle Buck  to provide loans 1 
to 4 to Mr M. But she considered it shouldnt have arranged loans 5 to 11. 
Ref: DRN47011843The investigator said she didnt think it was reasonable  for Uncle  Buck to arrange loan 5, 
because its checks shouldve revealed  it was unlikely that Mr M could afford to make his 
loan repayment.
But having  reviewed the figures and timescales  mentioned by the adjudicator, on balance I 
think she was referring  to loan 6, rather than loan 5.
Uncle Buck  has also accepted  that it shouldnt have arranged loan 6 for Mr M.
From what  Ive seen, I dont think it was unreasonable for Uncle Buck  to arrange  loans 1 to 5 
for Mr M. The loans were arranged during the early part of the lending relationship, and 
seem to have been affordable to Mr M. The loans  were repaid in line with the loan 
agreements. I think  Uncle Buck  ought  to have  looked further into Mr Ms finances as the 
months went on, but from what Ive seen, including credit file results, there was nothing  that 
Uncle Buck  shouldve been aware  of that couldve suggested it wasnt  appropriate for it to 
arrange the loans.
The adjudicator considered that by loan 6, Mr Ms pattern of borrowing suggested hed 
become persistently reliant on short-term loans.  This meant all of the loans from loan 6 
onwards were unsustainable,  so Uncle Buck shouldnt  have  arranged  any of them.
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ms case,  I agree with the adjudicator  that by loan 
6, Uncle  Buck should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. I say this because:
At this point Uncle Buck ought to have realised Mr M was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr M had taken out 6 loans within almost 7 months.  Each loan had 
been taken out the same day or within a matter of days of repaying the previous one. 
So Uncle  Buck  ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr M was having  to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ms indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Uncle Buck.  Hed first 
borrowed £350 in November 2014 and now six months later taking out his sixth loan 
meant he was still indebted  to Uncle  Buck but for a higher amount of £600. Loan 12 
was taken out over two and a half years after his first. And it was again for a larger 
amount. Mr M had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Uncle  
Buck over an extended period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Uncle Buck  continued to provide borrowing  from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 12 and Uncle Buck  should  put things right.
Ref: DRN47011844putting things right  what Uncle Buck needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans  6 to 11;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 12 should be removed from
Mr Ms credit file.
I understand there was an outstanding balance on loan 12 when Mr M brought  his 
complaint to this Service. This loan was for £800. I dont know if this loan remains  
outstanding or if Mr M has since repaid  it or its been  written off.
The information provided shows that Mr M had repaid more than the original loan capital. 
All payments Mr M paid above this amount  should  be refunded to him, along with 8% 
simple interest per year. 
Any outstanding balance  should  be written  off. But if Uncle Buck  does not own the 
outstanding balance then it must liaise with the current debt owner  to ensure Mr M does 
not make  any further payments for this loan.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Uncle Buck to take off tax from this interest. Uncle  Buck 
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ms complaint. Uncle  Buck Finance 
LLP should pay Mr M compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 November  2019.
