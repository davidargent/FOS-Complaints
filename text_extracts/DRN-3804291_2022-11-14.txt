The complaint
Mr S complains that Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited miscalculated the transfer value of a
fund within his Section-226 pension.
What happened
Mr S held a Section-226 pension which was invested in two of Avivas With-Profits funds.
Mr S wanted to transfer his funds to a new plan in order to facilitate income drawdown.
Aviva sent Mr S a statement on 19 January 2021 which set out the figures and fund values
as of 18 January 2021. Mr S gave Aviva an instruction to transfer the funds on 29 January
2021. Aviva acted on this instruction, and the transfer took place on 17 February 2021.
Mr S noticed the transfer value was less than the figure he had been given on 19 January
2021 and queried this with Aviva. Aviva responded to say the transfer value had been
correct, but the number of units in the With-Profits fund had been incorrect in the 19 January
2021 statement. After Mr S complained about this, Aviva paid him £200 compensation.
Mr S brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator recommended the complaint be
upheld. He thought Aviva had made an error in its calculation of the transfer value. He
recommended that Aviva put this right, and also pay £200 compensation.
I issued a provisional decision on 28 October 2022. Heres what I said:
It isnt in dispute that Aviva made an error in the statement dated 19 January 2021. It gave
Mr S the following information about his investment in the With Profits fund:
Number of units = 18898.3878
Unit price = £5.1615
Fund value = £97,544.03
However, the actual number of units Mr S held was 18697.9175.
As our investigator has explained, when a financial business makes an error, we expect the
business to place the consumer back in the position they would have been in (as far as
possible), if not for the error.
Mr Ss eventual transfer value was based on the correct number of units that he held. I dont
require Aviva to increase the transfer value to reflect the incorrect number of units contained
within the 19 January 2021 statement, as this would give Mr S a higher transfer value than
he was entitled to. Im satisfied that Mr S hasnt suffered a financial loss due to Avivas error.
Having said that, I think Aviva caused Mr S unnecessary confusion due to its error, and Mr S
would have been disappointed to learn that the actual number of units he held in the fund
was less than Aviva had led him to believe. Aviva has recognised this and paid Mr S £200
compensation for its error. I think this amount of compensation was reasonable and reflected
the loss of expectation that Mr S experienced.
Ive also thought about whether Mr S would have done anything differently if Aviva hadnt
made the error.
The total With-Profits fund value Mr S was quoted on 19 January 2021 was £97,544.03, and
the actual fund value received was £96,628.97 (though I appreciate the unit price did
increase slightly in the intervening period). Given the difference in the fund values was
relatively low in relation to the total transfer value (of just under £350,000) I think its unlikely
Mr S would have chosen not to transfer the funds in order to facilitate income drawdown if he
had known the correct number of units he held on 19 January 2021.
Our investigator thought Aviva had made an error in its calculation of the transfer value of
the With-Profits fund. I disagree. Aviva calculated a fund value of £96,628.97 based upon
there being 18697.9175 units held, with a unit price of £5.1679. Im satisfied this was correct.
Our investigator now accepts he had made an unfortunate error with his calculation.
I therefore dont intend to require Aviva to take any further action.
I invited both parties to provide any further comments they wished to make before I made a 
final decision. However, neither party responded with any further comments. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has responded with any further comments, I see no reason to change my 
provisional findings. I therefore remain satisfied that the £200 Aviva has paid Mr S was 
appropriate compensation for its error.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 December 2022.
