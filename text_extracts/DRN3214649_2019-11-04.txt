K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains that he was mis-sold  payment protection  insurance  (PPI)  by FirstRand 
Bank Limited, trading as Motonovo  Care  (FirstRand).
background
I set out the full background to this complaint in my provisional decision which I issued in 
July 2019. A copy of that provisional  decision is attached here and forms part of my final 
decision.
I invited both parties to provide any further evidence or representations they wished me to 
consider before I issued my final decision.  Mr W responded that he was content  to accept 
the offer in relation to the commission  payments. He didnt comment  on my findings about 
the mis-sale element. 
FirstRand didnt have  anything further  to add.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has made any further  comment or representation I see no reason to change 
my provisional decision.
putting things right
FirstRand should:
Pay Mr W the amount he paid each month for the unemployment  element of the PPI
Add simple interest to each payment from when he paid it until he gets it back. The 
rate of interest is 8% a year*.
If Mr W made a successful claim under the unemployment element of the PPI, 
FirstRand can take off what he got for the claim from the amount  it owes him.
In addition to this, FirstRand should  pay back to Mr W the extra  he paid each month on the 
accident, sickness and life elements of the policy  in relation to the commission  and profit  
share on these parts   any cost above 50% of the cost of the PPI. FirstRand  should  also pay 
Mr W 8% simple interest  on this.*
*HM Revenue and Customs requires FirstRand to take off tax from this interest.  FirstRand must  give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
Im partially upholding Mr Ws complaint  in relation  to the sale of the unemployment element 
of the PPI and the commission payments. FirstRand Bank Limited should pay compensation 
as I have described in putting things right.

reject my decision  before 4 December 2019.

background
Mr W was sold a PPI policy during a phone call with FirstRand.  It wouldve covered  the repayments 
on his hire purchase agreement for up to 12 months at a time if he was too sick to work or if he 
became unemployed.  It also wouldve settled  the outstanding finance if hed died during the 
agreement.
Mr W says that the terms of the policy  meant it wasnt suitable for him. And he says he didnt realise it 
was optional.
The adjudicator thought Mr Ws complaint should be upheld.  FirstRand disagree, so the case  has 
been passed  to me to make a decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about PPI on our website and Ive taken this into 
account when deciding this case. Having done so, Im provisionally intending to partially uphold Mr 
Ws complaint. Ill explain  why.
Mr W agreed to buy the policy during a phone call with FirstRand. Ive listened to the call and 
FirstRands representative makes several  references to the optional insurance. At the point of the call 
Mr W was already in possession of the car he bought  under the hire purchase agreement and the 
finance was arranged and in place. So Im satisfied Mr W was told, and wouldve  understood,  that the 
policy was optional. 
From the phone call Im also satisfied  that Mr W agreed to buy the policy
FirstRand recommended  the policy to Mr W, so it had to take reasonable  steps to make sure the 
policy was suitable for him. When our adjudicator first looked  at this case he thought, on the basis of 
the answers Mr W gave to FirstRand  about his personal  circumstances, the policy shouldnt  have 
been recommended. I agree  in part.
Mr W was asked whether hed be able to continue paying his agreement if he couldnt  work. Mr W 
thought he could. He said hed rely on his savings and help from his family. The FirstRand 
representative didnt explore this much further,  merely  establishing that Mr W still lived at home  
(presumably with his parents). But FirstRand still went on to recommend  the policy.
While it seems that FirstRands  recommendation  may have been based on inadequate information  I 
dont think, in relation to the accident  and sickness element or the life cover, it was necessarily 
unsuitable.
When Mr W brought his complaint to this service he told us he had savings worth about  three to six 
months salary. He had no sick pay. As the policy wouldve paid out for up to 12 months for any one 
claim, on up to three occasions over the course of the 60 month  loan, I think  the policy offered cover 
in addition to, and beyond,  that which  couldve been provided by Mr Ws savings. And while Im sure 
Mr Ws family wouldve  wanted to help him if they could  this kind of help cant be guaranteed  as 
peoples circumstances can change. 
Ref: DRN32146494So while I think FirstRand made their recommendation  for accident and sickness cover on inadequate 
information I dont think if it had explored Mr Ws resources further that their recommendation 
wouldve been  different.  So I dont think Mr W has lost out as a result of FirstRands failing here.
In relation to the life cover,  while FirstRand didnt explore  Mr Ws circumstances in detail  Mr W made it 
clear it was something he understood  and had been looking to buy anyway. It seems that he had 
wanted to protect his estate,  including his assets,  on behalf of his beneficiaries in the event  of his 
death. So again, I dont  think  the recommendation was unsuitable.  
However, I dont think the recommendation in relation  to the unemployment cover was suitable. 
Mr W was self-employed. The policy would only pay out for unemployment if Mr W ceased trading. Mr 
W was told this in the phone call. But FirstRand didnt explain how they defined  ceased trading  
during the phone call.
Looking at the policy document I can see that before Mr W could make an unemployment claim  he 
would have to wait until his business completely failed. And hed have to have provided  accounts to 
his last day of trading as well as submit his last tax return. So Mr W couldnt  have decided to close the 
business before it was actually insolvent, even if he couldnt meet  his day to day expenses. And even 
after it was insolvent he still had to complete  his accounts before he could make a claim. I think this 
was significant information  FirstRand  shouldve explained to Mr W. Mr W says if hed understood this 
he wouldnt have bought the policy. So I think Mr W lost out as a result of what FirstRand did wrong.
However, while I dont think the accident and sickness, and life elements of the policy were mis-sold, 
FirstRand got a high level of commission and profit share (more than 50% of the PPI premium)  so it 
should have told Mr W about that. Because FirstRand didnt tell Mr W, that was unfair.
To put that right, FirstRand has offered  to pay back the amount of commission and profit share  that 
was above 50% of the PPI premium  and I think that offer is fair in this case.
putting things  right 
Our adjudicator thought FirstRand should refund  all the premiums for the policy. FirstRand, while not 
agreeing that they mis-sold any part of the policy, say that they shouldnt have  to refund the premiums  
for the whole policy  only on the unemployment part.
The policy was sold to Mr W as a package. He was given  one overall  price for all three elements of 
cover, and FirstRand didnt make it clear that he could  separate out each benefit. But the paperwork 
that followed the sale shows that each part couldve been bought separately.  And Im satisfied that Mr 
W didnt lose out in the sale of the accident, sickness and life elements. I think  hed have still bought 
those parts of the cover even if he didnt buy the unemployment  cover. So I think its fair only to make 
FirstRand refund  the premiums he paid for the unemployment cover.  
If my decision becomes final, FirstRand should:
Pay Mr W the amount he paid each month for the unemployment element  of the PPI
Add simple  interest to each payment from when  he paid it until he gets it back. The rate of 
interest is 8% a year*.
If Mr W made a successful claim  under the unemployment  element of the PPI, FirstRand can 
take off what he got for the claim from the amount  it owes him.
In addition to this, FirstRand  should pay back to Mr W the extra  he paid each month on the accident,  
sickness and life elements  of the policy in relation to the commission and profit share  on these  parts  
any cost above 50% of the cost of the PPI. FirstRand should also pay Mr W 8% simple interest on 
this.*
Ref: DRN32146495*HM Revenue and Customs requires FirstRand to take off tax from this interest.  FirstRand must  give 
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my provisional  decision
Im currently  intending to partially uphold Mr Ws complaint.  I welcome any further information or 
representations either party chooses to provide which I receive before 16 August 2019. After  this, I 
will make my final decision.
If my decision becomes final FirstRand Bank Limited  will have to pay compensation as Ive detailed 
above.
