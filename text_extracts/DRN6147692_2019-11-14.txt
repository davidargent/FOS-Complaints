K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains that CarCashPoint  Limited  was irresponsible when it provided him with a 
logbook loan in December 2016. Hes also unhappy  about how the settlement of the loan 
was handled by CarCashPoint.
background
Mr H applied for a logbook loan from CarCashPoint in December 2016. The amount of credit 
was £560 although Mr H received only £500 into his bank account because the cost of the 
home visit fee of £60 was added to his loan.  The loan was repayable  over 36 months at 
£71.56 per month. This meant that the total repayable was £2,576.16 which  included  
£2,016.16 of interest. Repayment of the loan was secured on Mr Hs car so if he failed to 
meet the terms of the loan, his car could  be repossessed by CarCashPoint.
Mr H brought his complaint to this Service. In the most recent assessment, one of our 
adjudicators recommended that Mr Hs complaint should be upheld.  As CarCashPoint 
doesnt agree with her assessment the case has come to me for a final decision. If Mr H 
accepts my decision it will be binding on the parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Like our adjudicator, I dont think I need to make a decision about whether  anything went 
wrong when Mr H wanted to repay his loan early  because  Im satisfied that the loan 
shouldnt have been provided from the start. So, I am upholding his complaint about 
irresponsible lending.  I realise that CarCashPoint  will be disappointed by my decision, but I 
hope that my explanation below will help it understand  for my reasons for reaching this 
conclusion. 
At the time this loan was granted CarCashPoint was regulated by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA). Its Principles for Business (PRIN) set out the overarching  requirements 
applicable to all firms authorised by the FCA. 
PRIN 2.1.1  R (6) states that a firm must pay due regard to the interests of its customer  and 
treat them fairly.
The Consumer Credit  Sourcebook (CONC) sets out the rules and guidance which apply  to 
logbook loan providers  like CarCashPoint. CONC 5 provides details of a firms obligation  in 
relation to responsible lending. 
In particular, CarCashPoint  needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. It had to carry  out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H could repay his 
loan in a sustainable manner. And it had to consider the potential for the loan commitments  
to adversely impact  Mr Hs financial situation,  taking into account the information of which  it 
was aware at the point the loan was taken. 
Additionally, when carrying out its assessment CarCashPoint  had to consider more than 
simply assessing Mr Hs ability to repay the credit.  It had to be repayable in a sustainable 
way (CONC 5.3.1G(1)).  
Ref: DRN61476922For the loan repayments to be sustainable  Mr H would have to be able to make his 
repayments without  undue difficulties whilst meeting other  reasonable commitments  and 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments (over the whole three-year term) from 
income or savings.
Proportionate checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how 
much was being lent, the repayment  amounts  and the consumers income and expenditure. 
And what is proportionate depends on several  factors. The regulations arent prescriptive 
about what checks CarCashPoint  needed  to carry out. But the checks  needed to be 
proportionate. In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the 
potential risk to the consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way. 
From what  Ive seen Mr H began his application over the internet. It seems he provided 
some information at that point. CarCashPoint tells us it followed this up with a telephone  call 
although I understand that the call recording is no longer available. It has provided some 
written notes including its rationale behind the decision to approve  the loan.
CarCashPoint says that it asked Mr H about  his income and outgoings before providing the 
loan. I can see that it has noted a few figures and Ill go into this in more  detail below. It also 
confirmed to us that it doesnt carry out a formal credit reference  agency check: rather  it 
undertakes its own substantive checks  including a positive employment check  and 
verification of salary,  a review of bank  statements  and anti-money laundering and insolvency 
resources. It has provided  us with copies of the bank statements it received from Mr H.
In Mr Hs on-line  form he stated that his net salary was £1,500  per month.  But he declared  
zero for housing, council  tax, credit commitments (which CarCashPoint describes as non-
discretionary expenditure) and the same for other discretionary  expenditure. This meant  
according to the on-line  form that Mr H had a £1,500 per month  of disposable income.  He 
also chose from the drop-down list of options for loan reason that it was for unexpected 
expenses.
CarCashPoint has also provided  the affordability  assessment form which  includes hand-
written entries apparently  entered by at least two people  at least one of whom was a 
member of CarCashPoint staff. I can see that the income figure  declared  by Mr H was 
increased to £1,526 (£1,500  having been crossed out). There  is reference to a contribution 
from a partner of C£1,500  apparently  from employment with a supermarket. Some 
figures were  included in the expenditure column  including £150 for rent, £80 (council  tax), 
£100 (utilities), £53 (insurance), £30 (phone),  £200 (food, housekeeping)  and £400 
(loan/credit card).
Some additional information had been  included in the form in relation to Mr Hs credit 
commitments. It was noted that the balance was £10,000 and the name of a debt advice 
charity was inserted  in the margin. 
The lending rationale - completed by a member of CarCashPoints staff - included  in the 
Pre-payout check section stated:
clear evidence of past debt issues  now managed by [the debt advice  charity]  
being serviced first pmt 12 Dec £400.
Ref: DRN61476923Marginal lending but no new fundamental concerns so considered  acceptable at this 
level only - £560  only
Debt consolidation  suitable  CCP loan will reduce monthly outgoings. 
Partner contributes to h/h budget  additional support
There are several things which are incomplete  and contradictory in this form which it seems 
were used by CarCashPoint in its assessment.
Mr H says he was living at home with his parents: this was stated on his on-line form. 
CarCashPoint has told us that it allowed £150 for rent because Mr H stated  his wife 
contributed to the household budget and this was verified on his statements. But 
Mr H is adamant that he did not say this as he was living with his parents. I'm unclear 
where the statements show a regular second  income being  paid into Mr Hs account. 
But I can see - in the statements in CarCashPoints possession  - there  were  
payments to Mr Hs mother of £250 at the end of November and the beginning of 
December 2016 - described as rent.  Im satisfied  that CarCashPoint  was wrong to 
take into account the support of a partner. Im satisfied  that Mr H was living at home 
paying his mother  rent. As there was a discrepancy  in the information CarCashPoint 
had about Mr Hs living  circumstances it shouldve  done  more to understand this 
accurately.  
CarCashPoint used  an income  figure for Mr H of £1,526. But it had bank statements 
which showed Mr Hs income from his salary at the end of October was £1,379. I 
accept that his November salary  was £1,526 but this is a significant discrepancy - of 
around 10% - in what  is not a particularly high income and for someone  who was in a 
debt management  plan.  I think CarCashPoint shouldve done more  to verify this than 
simply take into account the last payment. If it had verified Mr Hs income it would  
have learnt that normally it was in the region of £1,379   the lower figure it could  see 
on his statements. I've seen his statements for January and February 2017 and his 
salary was £1,369  and £1,379.  I think CarCashPoint was wrong to take the figure  of 
£1,526 into account  for Mr Hs income.
The statements  also showed that Mr H was paying  £53 for insurance  and £20 for his car tax. 
And he was spending far more in petrol stations than the £50 declared.  I accept  that he may 
not always have  been paying  for fuel but  given that the margins  were  tight -  CarCashPoint  
ought to have clarified what  he did spend as so many transactions at fuel stations were  on 
his statements. I can see from the form completed  by the debt management charity that 
Mr H told them that he was spending around  £225  and there is a note that this was due to 
him doing around 200 miles per week for work.  Even  without maintenance on his car he was 
spending almost  £300  on car related expenses.  
Mr H told CarCashPoint he spent around £30 on his phone, £200 on food and around £100  
on entertainment and clothing. These totalled  around £330. On top of that CarCashPoint 
was aware of the debt management plan of £400.  And it shouldve taken into account the 
figure of £250  for rent to his mother and about  £300  for car related costs.  In other words, 
virtually all of Mr Hs monthly income was taken  up by normal  monthly  expenditure. After  
repayment of his loan to CarCashPoint  at £76 he was going to be left with only a few pounds 
each month  from which to meet all his other expenditure. So I'm satisfied that had 
CarCashPoint done a proportionate check it wouldve seen that Mr H couldnt afford this loan 
on a straight pounds and pence basis. . 
Ref: DRN61476924But the circumstances themselves shouldve  shown CarCashPoint that it was unlikely Mr H 
would be able to repay the loan sustainably. I say this because  CarCashPoint  was aware of 
Mr Hs debt management plan involving  the support of the charity which had arranged a plan 
for Mr H only two weeks before applying  for this loan. It wasnt  as though this plan had been 
in place several months and was running successfully to bring down Mr Hs indebtedness. It 
had just started.  CarCashPoint  itself stated in its rationale for its lending decision that Mr H 
had past debt issues.  And it described  this as marginal lending. So it seems that it had 
some reservations about his credit worthiness.
I also think its worth mentioning that I dont think that CarCashPoint was reasonable to 
conclude that this loan of £500 was likely to be used for debt consolidation or that it would 
reduce monthly outgoings. Mr H had told CarCashPoint that the loan was for unexpected 
expenses. And, his outstanding credit  amounted  to £10,000. So it was unlikely that taking 
this expensive loan which was going to cost him  over the whole term - around £56 per 
month in interest  (plus repayment  of the capital) was going to reduce his outgoings.  As the 
charity had only recently set up a debt management  plan its likely that it had done so on the 
basis of Mr Hs most recent figures for his income  and outgoings.  £400 was a relatively 
large proportion  of Mr Hs income  almost 30% of his income. So even though 
CarCashPoint  on the figures it used concluded  that Mr H could afford  the loan on a pounds 
and pence basis,  I dont think it was reasonable for it to conclude that Mr H would likely be 
able to repay over £76 every month for the next three years  sustainably.
I note that CarCashPoint told our adjudicator that whilst the term of the loan was 36 months, 
it couldve been settled  at any time without any additional future interest being charged. But 
it had to consider  whether Mr H would be able to sustainably repay the loan over the whole  
term of the loan. 
CarCashPoint also says that Mr H made  his repayments on time and that 11 of the 14 
repayments he made were greater  than the amounts  due. From the statement of account 
provided by CarCashPoint it seems that that Mr H repaid £171.56  a few days  after taking the 
loan. I can see that Mr H drew down £300 from a high-cost revolving credit facility  he had in 
place, on the day he took the CarCashPoint loan. It seems to me that he used this to make 
the large repayment to CarCashPoint; in other words he was using credit from one lender to 
repay another. This appears to have been applied against the capital balance.  From that 
point Mr H generally repaid around £50 per month which was less than the amount stated in 
the credit  agreement, but this may have been because  repayments had been recalculated 
after the capital  amount  had been  reduced. 
So, its unclear  whether  Mr H did overpay each month; its possible that he did. But I can 
also see that virtually every month he was late in making his repayment. So in the first nine 
months of the loan he was charged a late fee on eight occasions - each time £15 was added  
to his outstanding balance. And I think its important to point out, the fact that Mr H made 
regular payments doesnt necessarily show that he was doing  so from sustainable means   
as demonstrated  by the first repayment  he made.
With all this in mind  I'm satisfied that CarCashPoint shouldnt have approved  this loan for 
Mr H and it should now put things right.
putting things right
Ref: DRN61476925I am satisfied that although the credit  agreement stated that the loan was for £560, part of 
that was a fee for the home  visit and that Mr H only had the benefit of £500. As such this is 
what I require CarCashPoint to do to put things  right:
a)add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr H towards interest,  fees and 
charges on this loan (in other  words, everything  he paid over and above the £500 
capital he had the benefit of), 
b)calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr H which were 
considered as part of a), calculated from the date he originally  made the payments, 
to the date the complaint is settled
c)pay Mr H the total of a) plus b).
d)remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Hs credit file in relation to this loan
 *HM Revenue & Customs  requires CarCashPoint to deduct tax from this interest. It should give Mr H a certificate  
showing how much tax hes paid if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above I uphold Mr Hs complaint and require CarCashPoint  
Limited to put things  right in the way I've described.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 December  2019.
