The complaint
Mr F complains that Ageas Insurance Limited should refund him after the cancellation of his
motor trade insurance policy. 
What happened
Mr F took out cover in connection with his motorcycle business. The cover was a motor trade
road risks policy and motor legal protection.
A broker arranged the cover. It said that the cost was as follows:
road risks £   890.55
insurance premium tax £   106.87
subtotal £   997.42
motor legal protection £     35.00
policy issue fee £   150.00
subtotal £1,182.42
Mr F paid a £700.00 deposit or advance payment. So the balance was £482.42. Mr F agreed 
to pay the balance plus interest by nine instalments of about £60.00 to a finance company. 
The total payable was going to be £1,254.78.
Ageas was the insurance company named in the road risks policy. Cover was going to be for
the year from 20 April 2022.
A different insurance company was named in the legal protection policy. That was for the
year from an earlier date in April 2022.
Mr F says the finance company took payments as follows: 
20 May 2022  £  61.66
20 June 2022  £103.55
Unfortunately, Mr F had to give up his motorcycle business. On about 29 June 2022, he
contacted the broker about cancelling the policy and getting a refund. Mr F complained to 
the broker about its response.
By a final response dated early July 2022, the broker said that if Mr F wanted to cancel, then
it would keep the £150.00 and the £35.00 and there would be a charge for time on cover.
The broker didnt accept the complaint.
Mr F brought that complaint to us in early July 2022. He told us that he was struggling to pay
for fuel to travel to work or to visit his brother who was terminally ill.
The broker cancelled the policy with effect from 8 July 2022. So Mr Fs time on cover had
been about 11 weeks.
In mid-November 2022, our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint against the
broker should be upheld.
Through us, Mr F complained to Ageas in November 2022.
Ageas didnt send a final response to Mr F. Ageas told us that the broker was the
underwriter.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld. He thought that Mr F
should only be charged for his time on cover by Ageas. He recommended that Ageas should
calculate the amount of policy refund applicable and issue the refund to Mr F.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr F  
and to Ageas on 15 June 2023. I summarise my findings:
The refund of £976.93 was much more than the refund of about 80% I wouldve 
expected. So  unlike the investigator  I wasnt minded to find it fair to direct Ageas 
to make any further refund to Mr F. 
Subject to any further information from Mr F or from Ageas, my provisional decision was that 
I didnt uphold this complaint. I didnt intend to direct Ageas Insurance Limited to do any 
more in response to this complaint. 
Mr F disagreed with the provisional decision. He says, in summary, that: 
In early July 2022, he asked for a refund of his advance payment, but the broker said 
it did not refund deposits.
The broker didnt inform him that the money would be retained to pay off the finance 
agreement. If the broker had told him that, then he wouldve instructed them the keep 
the policy going. That wouldve been better than incurring more costs by taking out a 
further insurance policy.
Ageas hasnt responded to the provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Fs response to the provisional decision
The Financial Ombudsman Service deals with a consumers complaint against one regulated 
financial firm at a time. Im dealing with Mr Fs complaint against Ageas. So Ive looked at 
acts and omissions for which I hold Ageas responsible. I wont name the broker or make any 
findings against it in this decision.I wouldnt hold Ageas responsible for any statement by the broker that it didnt make refunds. 
And I wouldnt hold Ageas responsible for any failure by the broker to explain how it had 
applied his deposit.
My consideration of Mr Fs complaint 
Ive seen a notice dated December 2021 telling policyholders of some changes to their road
risks policy. The notice was headed with the brand name and logo of the broker. But it said
that the policy was between the policyholder and Ageas. The notice said that the broker
arranged the policy. The notice also said that the broker administered the policy.
I consider that all of that is consistent with Ageass statement that it had given the broker
delegated authority. Nevertheless, I consider that Ageas remained responsible to Mr F for
the calculation of charges for time on cover, even if that was delegated to the broker.
I would expect Ageas to have made a charge proportionate to about 11 weeks out of the 52
weeks (so about 20%) of the yearly cost of £997.42. I would expect Ageas to make any
refund via the broker. The broker told us the following:
The client refund was calculated based on firstly a returned premium from the
insurer of £976.93. Out of this amount our branch retained a commission of £174.43
for the arrangement of the policy which left £802.50. The client was paying in
instalments so this had to be settled with the finance provided.
The balance due to them was £656.97 to do so and which left £145.53 due to the
client.
The refund of £976.93 is much more than the refund of about 80% I wouldve expected. So 
unlike the investigator  I dont find it fair to direct Ageas to make any further refund to Mr F.
I consider that the reasons why the broker only offered Mr F about £140.00 were to do with
some or all of the following:
The broker or the legal protection insurer didnt refund any of the £35.00.
The broker didnt refund its £150.00 policy issue fee.
The broker retained a commission of £174.43.
The finance company asked for a balance of £656.97 and the broker paid it.
I dont hold Ageas responsible for any of those actions by the broker, the legal protection 
insurer or the finance company.
Overall I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Ageas to do any more in response to this 
complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Ageas Insurance Limited to do any more in response to this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2023.
