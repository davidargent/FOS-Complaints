The complaint
Mr E complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA did not take his individual 
circumstances into account when registering a default. 
What happened
Mr E suffered mental health issues which resulted in financial difficulties. He travelled abroad 
to help him recuperate.
Mr E says he contacted PayPal around April 2019 to let them know he would be going 
abroad and to change his address. He said he cancelled all of his direct debits before he 
went abroad. 
Mr E fell behind on a credit agreement with PayPal and arrears started accruing. His 
payments for July and August werent made. PayPal said Mr Es bank had cancelled the 
direct debit mandate.
PayPal tried to contact Mr E to discuss his situation. He said they were ringing 10-15 times a 
day and were harassing him. Mr E said he tried to explain his situation to PayPal but they 
werent listening to what he was saying so he blocked PayPals telephone number until he 
returned the UK in October.
PayPal issued a default notice dated 16 September 2019 for arrears around £60. The letter 
explained that the breach can be remedied by paying these arrears by 30 September 2019.
Mr E says he contacted PayPal on 2 October 2019 to explain his circumstances again. He 
says he told them that he should be in a better mental position to resolve this in November. 
PayPal said the default notice was sent to Mr Es registered address and they defaulted the 
account on 16 October 2019. PayPal attempted to complete income and expenditure details 
with Mr E to set up an affordable income plan. Mr E declined to do this as he told them that 
he was selling a house so should be able to pay PayPal soon. On 30 October 2019 Mr E 
arranged with PayPal to settle the debt for £200.
Mr E complained to PayPal as he said they had not taken his mental health or his 
circumstances into consideration when dealing with him. He said he had not received the 
default notice PayPal sent as he had been abroad. Mr E said he had made attempts to make 
a payment after 2 October but while he could log on to PayPal online, the payment options 
section of the website wasnt available. Mr E also complained about the customer service he 
received.
PayPal said they were right to record the default as they have to accurately report payment 
history to credit agencies and they wouldnt remove the default. They also said they advised 
Mr E of the default notice on 2 October 2019 call and the impact this could have. PayPal 
offered Mr E £100 as a goodwill gesture for the poor customer experience he said he 
received. Mr E brought his complaint to our service as he felt the default should be removed 
from his credit file.
During the investigation our investigator found that PayPal did not register a vulnerable 
marker for Mr E until November. The investigator showed PayPal proof of further 
communication with Mr E and PayPal and asked for the calls and emails relating to this but 
PayPal were unable to provide these. The investigator summarised that PayPal hadnt 
shown enough forbearance to Mr E and said that PayPal should remove the default and pay 
the £100.
PayPal asked for the complaint to be referred to an Ombudsman. They said that by moving 
him to a vulnerable status earlier this still wouldnt have stopped the default being registered 
and they said they cant remove the default.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr E has made a number of points to both PayPal and this service and Ive considered and 
read everything hes said and sent us. But, in line with this services role as a quick and 
informal body Ill be focusing on the crux of his complaint in deciding whats fair and 
reasonable here.
Both parties dont agree on a timeline of events so Ive looked at all of the information 
available to me in order to decide what each party is likely to have known and when.
PayPal say they have sent us all of their records here. But having done so, the information 
theyve provided is limited. For example, Ive seen that PayPal has no record of several of 
the calls Mr E has mentioned in some detail. Nor do they have any record of outgoing calls 
that were made or emails that Mr E sent. Mr E has provided evidence of the emails and has 
provided some detail of these calls.
PayPal sent out a default notice in September 2019 to the address they had registered on 
file for Mr E. He says he did not receive the default notice as he was abroad and it was sent 
to the wrong address. Mr E says he told PayPal of a change of address. Theres no clear 
evidence to show whether this happened or not. So I cant say one way or another whether 
PayPal wouldve been aware that Mr E wouldnt be at the registered property and would be 
in a position to react to the default notice. But, PayPal had a regulatory requirement of 
sending a default notice to the registered address.
What I think is more important to focus on here is that both parties agree that they had a 
conversation on 2 October 2019. At this point the default notice had been sent and the 
timeframe included in this had passed. So PayPal wouldve been entitled to have recorded it. 
But the reality is that the default hadnt actually been registered in relation to what he owed. 
During this call, it seems that Mr E informed PayPal of his personal situation. The call notes 
state that the call handler advised Mr E of the default and the risks, Mr E says he was not 
aware a default was being registered. But Im unable to see a transcript of the call as the call 
is no longer held by PayPal so I cant say what exactly was explained to Mr E here.
The system notes show that on the same call PayPal tried to complete income and 
expenditure details for Mr E, however, he declined to do so as he said he was in the process 
of selling a property and would be able to pay them a lump sum. PayPal also agreed to stop 
contacting Mr E in light of the information he told them.
I do think PayPal should have updated their records to show Mr Es vulnerable status on 2 
October 2019 as they were made aware at this point about Mr Es circumstances. Although PayPal have said this wouldnt have prevented the default from being registered, I think 
there were options which couldve been fairly explored in the individual circumstances here 
which mightve been able to prevent this. 
In addition this step might have resulted in call handlers treating him more proportionately 
and being more considerate, as they wouldve been able to appreciate that Mr E had some 
difficult personal issues he had been dealing with. Had they done so, I think it wouldve been 
fair that PayPal explored options with Mr E which wouldve prevented this small amount 
defaulting  even where the date on the default notice had passed. 
I say this as Mr E had already explained the house sale would be able to help him clear his 
arrears and its a shame that a default was registered for a low amount for somebody who 
was going through some serious personal circumstances. At the time the default notice was 
sent in September, it showed an arrears figure of slightly over £60. I realise that PayPal says 
that even if Mr E was passed to the relevant team here, it wouldnt have avoided the default. 
But that doesnt mean that the outcome is fair here. Instead, Id like to think that PayPal 
wouldve taken Mr Es individual circumstances into account, alongside the overall situation 
here and explored more potential options with him. I think doing so in a fairer and more 
proportionate way would have led to a different outcome here - likely preventing a default for 
such a low amount, the impact of which will be very serious for Mr E.
PayPals notes show the conversation on 2 October show Mr E was out of work and out of 
the UK, receiving treatment. So at this point PayPal wouldve been aware that he wouldnt 
have seen the default notice. This is the call where Mr E informed PayPal that he would be 
selling a property so didnt want to complete income and expenditure. PayPal agreed to 
delay calls for one week. On 11 October call, PayPals notes show that he is waiting for the 
property to be sold and this would be in the next few weeks. The account defaulted on 16 
October from the information that PayPal sent us but PayPals system notes show that the 
default wasnt registered with the credit agencies until 31 October. 
Mr E did say he would be able to satisfy the arrears shortly as he was selling a house and it 
wouldnt take too long for the transaction to complete. Mr E explained to PayPal that he 
would be in a better place mentally to make a payment of arrears in November. A house sale 
is never guaranteed, but given that the default still had yet to be registered when he spoke to 
PayPal on 02 October or 11 October, I think it wouldve been fair for PayPal to have shown 
more forbearance to Mr E and held off registering the default - giving him more time to pay 
due to his individual circumstances.
Mr E has sent us evidence of a reply from PayPal on 30 October but unfortunately Im 
unable to see the content of the message as Mr E has said that the messages in the 
message centre only show for six months but he has said he was trying to make a payment 
here. PayPal has said to us that he made them an offer on this date, although unfortunately 
there are no system notes to document what was discussed here.
Although PayPal did give him some time to make a payment, for the reasons previously 
mentioned Im not satisfied that strictly following the time limit in the default notice was fair in 
the circumstances here. I say this as its clear from the information Mr E sent us that he tried 
to make a payment in October. But, because of system issues, which werent his fault, he 
was unable to. Mr E has said that while he could log into the account the pay now button 
was unavailable. He says he talked to six or seven people regarding this and PayPal 
couldnt solve this. He said if this was button was available he would have paid the arrears 
and in the meantime PayPal gave him a default. 
Mr E said a member of staff from the Irish office was finally able to resolve the problem after 
being on a call for over two hours. Once PayPal had resolved these issues he made a payment in early November which showed he did have the means to make the payment 
when he said he would, even if this was outside the stated timeframe from the default notice.
Im satisfied PayPal did show some forbearance to Mr E by later accepting an offer of £200 
to settle the debt and delaying calls to him but this was after the default had been registered.
So, overall here, PayPal sent the default notice to what they said was Mr Es address, 
offered to stop calls to him and tried to complete a budget planner with him. But had PayPal 
have shown more forbearance here and taken Mr Es circumstances into account in a fairer 
and more proportionate way, then based on Mr Es specific individual circumstances Im 
satisfied the default could have been avoided and so it follows I will be asking PayPal to put 
things right.
Putting things right
Our investigator has suggested that PayPal remove the default from Mr Es credit file, which 
I think is fair in the circumstances. PayPal have made an offer of £100 for the poor customer 
experience that Mr E feels he may have had. I think this is fair as this reflects the impact of 
Mr E having to keep contacting PayPal to arrange his online payment access and the poor 
customer service.
My final decision
PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should remove the default from Mr Es credit file and pay 
him £100 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 March 2021.
