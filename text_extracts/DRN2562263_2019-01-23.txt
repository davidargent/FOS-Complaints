K821x#15complaint
Mr A complains about loans approved by CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading both as QuickQuid 
and Pounds to Pocket, and referred to in this decision  as CashEuroNet.  
Mr A says that he was given so many payday  and instalment loans with CashEuroNet,  that 
to repay  them  he had to borrow from other lenders and he was trapped  in a vicious circle of 
loans leading to a great deal of debt. 
background
The background to this complaint is important  for the overall understanding of the lending  
relationship between CashEuroNet and Mr A. So I will set it out here briefly  including the 
stages of the complaint history and the current position.
Mr A took 44 loans from CashEuroNet between January 2011 and October 2017. The 
schedule to this decision is a loan table which summarises some  of the loan details.  With the 
additional top-up  loans  given, then there were about 80 lending  decisions made by 
CashEuroNet in all. Where there has been a top-up the loan is labelled with a small letter  
example 12a. 
Most of the loans  were payday loans.  Two were  loans which were repayable by instalments. 
One was an open-ended  line of credit call a FlexCredit  account.  There  were occasions  when 
the gaps in time between Mr A repaying  one loan and applying  for another were  significant 
and I have addressed  those particular gaps where relevant.
CashEuroNet has objected to us looking at Loans  1 to 7 as they were lent to Mr A more than 
six years  before the complaint  date of 7 November  2017. This was explained  to Mr A and he 
chose to remove those  early loans from his complaint. Loan  8 (21 January 2012) onwards  
were assessed. 
our adjudicators view
Loans 1 to 7  not included in the complaint.
Loans 8 to 11a  on the information available  to our adjudicator,  the complaints in relation to 
these loans were not upheld.  
Loans 12 to 21  CashEuroNet had conceded in the first set of submissions it sent to us that 
it had done something wrong and needed to put things right for Mr A in relation  to these 
loans. It explained  it had upheld these loans  and said:
 
At the time Mr A requested loans  12-21  we can see that a pattern of dependency  
had emerged.  We say this because Mr A had minimal breaking periods between  
these loans and began  to request multiple top ups and drawdowns  on each loan. 
Mr As full name  was removed by me in this quote  in line with the anonymous  nature of this 
published decision. I have done the same in other  quotes below. 
Loans 22 and 23 - even though these were  a different type of loan  instalment loans   our 
adjudicator thought that the complaints  in relation  to these loans should  be upheld.  
Ref: DRN25622632Loans 24 to 28  there were a number of reasons  given as to why our adjudicator did not 
think that the complaint about  these  loans should  be upheld. These included the fact that 
there was about  12 months between Mr A repaying Loan 23 and applying for Loan  24 and 
another gap before Loan 25. Our adjudicator decided  that these were  long enough periods 
of time between lending for the pattern of dependency to have been  broken. 
Loans 29 to 44b were  upheld.  In the opinion letter there was reference to Loan 45 but I think 
this was an administrative error  there is no Loan  45. 
what Mr A thought
Mr A is not disputing our adjudicators findings in relation to Loans 8 to 11a and 
Loans 24 to 28. So I do not consider  those to be in dispute any further.
CashEuroNets position
CashEuroNet had already offered to put things right for Mr A in relation to Loans 12 to 21 
and it agreed with our adjudicator in relation to the two instalment Loans  22 and 23. It made 
an additional  offer on these  two but gave  no explanation as to why, other than to say it 
wished to resolve the complaint. So Loans  12 to 23 are not in dispute  any longer. 
As Loans 24 to 28 were  not ones our adjudicator was recommending  to uphold, then 
CashEuroNet has indicated acceptance on those. 
what remains in dispute?
CashEuroNet did not agree with the adjudicators view in relation to Loans  29 to 44b. These 
appear to be unresolved  so it is these I will be considering. The total complaint history  
remains of relevance  to my decision and I have not considered  Loans  29 to 44b in isolation 
but in the context of the complete lending relationship. 
In June 2018 CashEuroNet sent us some very specific secondary submissions in relation to 
Loans 29 to 44b. I will address these points  in the main body of my decision. 
my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Briefly, before lending  money to a consumer  a lender should take proportionate steps to 
understand whether the consumer will be able to repay what they are borrowing in a 
sustainable manner  without it adversely impacting  on their financial situation. 
A lender should gather enough  information  for it to be able to make an informed decision on 
the lending. Although the guidance  and rules themselves did not set out compulsory checks, 
they did list a number of things a lender could take into account  before agreeing  to lend. The 
key element was that any checks needed  to be proportionate and had to take into account a 
number of different  things,  including how much was being lent and when  the sum being  
borrowed was due to be repaid. I will explain this in more detail below.
 
Ref: DRN25622633Loan 29 onwards
Loan 29 would have been the fifth payday loan application in seven months. It was for £250  
and the highest amount applied for in this second  loan chain. So I think  that CashEuroNet 
ought to have been carrying  out a comprehensive review  of Mr As financial position. I think  
that would  have been the proportionate  approach.  I would have expected CashEuroNet  to 
have verified Mr As income, his outgoings,  expenses, regular financial commitments and 
also considered  what other short-term  liabilities  he may have had at the time Mr A applied 
for each  loan from this point onwards.   
CashEuroNets explanations
CashEuroNet has sent us an email in June  2018  which says: 
Starting 01 March 2015 before Mr A borrowed these loans, QuickQuid had 
implemented an affordability review that is consistent with the FCA Handbook  and 
that was in place at the time we received authorisation by the FCA. We confirm  that 
this assessment was conducted properly and individually for each of these loans.
FCA refers to the Financial Conduct  Authority which regulates firms and authorises 
CashEuroNet. 
And CashEuroNet  goes on to explain (CRA refers to credit reference agency): 
Our assessment for affordability  especially focuses on validating  Monthly  Credit  
Commitments expense  category to ensure  that any short term credit and payments 
are included in this category. To this effect, we validate the reasonableness of the 
customers self-reported expense amount the CRA data to ensure the customer is 
being truthful and providing an accurate picture  of his or her financial situation, 
including any of the customers other  high cost short term loans. Given this external 
validation process;  which  has been  in place  since 01 March 2015, we firmly  believe 
our checks  went  far enough  with respect  to verifying  customer  expenses.
QuickQuid uses validated  data in order to determine the customers  estimated  
disposable income (EDI). QuickQuid only makes loans where total payments are less 
than 80% of the customers total EDI for the term of the loan. This assessment, 
including the validation of expenses and income is conducted on each loan 
application.
There follows in that email to us in June 2018 a table created by CashEuroNet  in relation to 
Mr As loans  from March 2015.  CashEuroNet says that the table  shows  the cost of each 
loan, plus the figure  it has calculated to be Mr As estimated disposable  income, and a 
percentage figure which is described  as a loans cost percent  of EDI. 
Looking at the EDI figures, its possible that they were calculated  by taking the declared 
income from Mr A and subtracting expenditure given  to CashEuroNet by Mr A. But 
modifications of the figures have been done  and the straight subtraction method does not 
lead to the same figures put forward by CashEuroNet. This has not been  fully explained. 
Ref: DRN25622634CashEuroNet has said in a more general paragraph  that We further compare the expense  
figures to average  expense data published  by the Office of National Statistics (ONS).  
So I take it from this that CashEuroNet has used  the ONS statistics for Mr A and adapted his 
expenses figures accordingly.  I have  not seen details of these figures. 
Or it may mean that CashEuroNet has deducted some other loan repayments CashEuroNet  
may have  discovered  from its CRA searches, but I have seen nothing to evidence that. 
I demonstrate the differing calculations with three  examples. 
Loan 29 was approved  on 2 June 2016. Mr As declared income was £1,625 and his 
declared expenditure was £525. When this is subtracted from the income figure  it leaves 
£1,100. However,  the monthly EDI figure CashEuroNet has for Mr A appears on its table as 
£1,038. This is a £62 difference to the straight  subtraction of the figures it was given by Mr A 
which is not explained.
Another example  is Loan 31, approved on 14 July 2016 where  CashEuroNet has listed in its 
table Mr As income as £1,635. Mr A had told CashEuroNet his expenditure was £625 and a 
straight subtraction would  leave a balance  figure  of £1,010.  But CashEuroNet has Mr As 
monthly EDI figure on its table as £745.  This is a £265 difference which  has not been 
explained. 
Similarly for Loan 37 approved in January 2017:  Mr As declared income less his declared 
expenditure gives a balance  of £1,010  but Mr As monthly EDI is recorded on CashEuroNets  
table as £480. This is a difference of £530 and is unexplained. 
CashEuroNet also explains that 
Where  material  discrepancies  are found, we request the customers  bank  statement  
to further evaluate their incomings and outgoings. 
I have thought about this carefully. And using Loan  37 as an example (given above) the 
unexplained difference  in the figures  was an alteration of about 50% (£1,010  compared  to 
CashEuroNets figure of £480). I do think that this shows that there was a material  
discrepancy. 
So in line with CashEuroNets  own approach, I would have expected it to have checked this 
by asking for bank  statements from Mr A. But having read the emails  between Mr A and 
CashEuroNet I cannot see that it received any bank statements  from Mr A to clear up these 
discrepancies for these  loans around this time.
 
CashEuroNet concludes  its June  2018 submissions by saying:
since 1st March 2015, QuickQuid implemented affordability review, which involved 
collecting and validating  income and expense details from customers, in line with the 
FCA Handbook. As such, we believe Mr A's loans issued post 2015 were affordable.
CashEuroNet is relying on its FCA authorisation to demonstrate satisfactory  pre-contract 
assessments for loans.  The explanations  and table submitted to us by CashEuroNet to 
defend the complaint about  the loans from Loan  29 onwards do not demonstrate, on their 
own, compliance with aspects of the requirements  under  those same  FCA rules and the 
Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC). And the foundation of my role as an ombudsman is 
statutory1. 
Ref: DRN25622635I am required to consider  more than the rules and guidance set out by the regulators in 
making my determination on a complaint,  but also decide by reference to what  I think is fair 
and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. 
some regulations and rules
I will need to set out some of the FCA rules for ease of reference and for background. Some  
of these rules changed on 1 November 2018  and so the CONC provisions I set out here are 
the rules and wording  in place at the time CashEuroNet would have received Mr As 
applications.
A potential  lender had to carry out an assessment of the creditworthiness  of an 
applicant/customer: CONC 5.2.1R (1). 
A firm must consider (a) the potential for the commitmentsto adversely impact the 
customers financial situation, taking  into account  the information of which  the firm is aware  
at the time theagreement is to be made; and (b) the ability  of the customer  to make the 
repayments as they fall due... CONC 5.2.1R (2). 
The firm should take into account more  than assessing the customers  ability  to repay the 
credit. CONC 5.3.1G. It ought  to take reasonable steps to assess the customers ability to 
meet repayments  in a sustainable  manner. Sustainable means that the applicant  is able 
to repay  on time, out of income and savings, without  undue  difficulties, and without having  to 
borrow to meet those  repayments: CONC 5.3.1G (6). 
Examples of the extent  and scope  of the creditworthiness assessment should be dependent 
upon and proportionate  to factors which  may include one or more of the following  and the 
list that follows includes: the type and the amount of credit; the financial position  of the 
applicant; the customers credit history; existing and future financial commitments and any 
future changes in circumstances which could be reasonably expected to have a significant 
financial adverse  impact on the customer;  CONC 5.2.3G.
The FCA recognised  that consideration of all factors in all cases was likely  disproportionate:  
CONC 5.2.4G. And part of the consideration when looking  at proportionality of the checks 
was the potential risks to the customer . And goes  on to say that the risk of credit not being 
sustainable directly  relates to the amount of credit  granted and the total charge  for credit 
relative to the customer's financial situation. CONC 5.2.4  (2).
what does this tell me?
Having considered all of this, I do not think that CashEuroNet  carried out the comprehensive 
assessment of Mr As financial  position  I would have expected it to have done in order  to br 
proportionate. CashEuroNets  monthly  EDI table plus the loan cost percent of EDI figures 
do not demonstrate to me that it knew enough  about  Mr As financial situation. And it does  
not show it had checked the sustainability element required in a creditworthiness  
assessment. 
1 Financial  Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended)  
Ref: DRN25622636These figures in the CashEuroNet table are inconsistent  with the spreadsheet data 
CashEuroNet has sent us. And any data it used and which  may have  altered  the EDI figures 
has not been evidenced. 
I can demonstrate  that Mr As other  credit  commitments appear not to have been taken into 
account, or if they were taken into account, not accurately.
Using one of the example sets of figures I used earlier  for consistency - Loan 29 - 
CashEuroNet had Mr As monthly EDI figure on its table as £1,038. Whereas I have 
reviewed the information  our adjudicator  has assessed in his opinion  letter  in July 2018. His 
research shows a different picture.  Mr As income was about  £1,600,  his living  costs  and 
regular financial commitments  (including  a debt management plan)  amounted to about 
£1,900 plus he had STL liability to at least one other  STL lender around this time. So it 
seems that Mr As situation was that his expenditure and credit  commitments exceeded his 
income and Mr A had no disposable income  that month.
So the monthly EDI figure of £1,038  calculated by CashEuroNet, compared with the reality  of 
the situation (nil) are very far apart.  This casts further doubt on the reliability of the figures in 
the table provided  by CashEuroNet  in the circumstances of Mr As case. And when I look at 
the financial picture I have  seen for Mr A, had CashEuroNet  discovered the same  I think it 
unlikely it would have  lent to him in June 2016  (Loan 29). 
This comparison of CashEuroNets monthly  EDI table with the reality of the situation  
consistently does  not match. So I do not consider  that the EDI table is a reliable set of 
figures on which to demonstrate that CashEuroNet carried out the creditworthiness  
assessments accurately.  
CashEuroNet continued to lend to Mr A for a further 16 months (June 2016 to October 2017) 
and having reviewed all the evidence that our adjudicator considered I can see that Mr A 
was not in a position  to repay these loans. His STL liability increased exponentially. His 
expenditure and credit  commitments regularly exceeded his income.  
CashEuroNets own logic and reasons for making  significant concessions and offers  in 
relation to Loans 12 to 21 demonstrate to me that it recognises and understands that 
dependency on loans  and the inability to repay  in a sustainable way was a factor when  
assessing loan requests.  
I set out CashEuroNets reasons for upholding  Loans 12 to 21 above  and do so again  here:  
a pattern of dependency had emerged. We say this because Mr A had minimal breaking 
periods between these loans and began to request multiple top ups and drawdowns on each 
loan. 
The FCA rules in 2015 do not alter the concept of sustainability already in place in 2014 in 
any significant way. So I would not expect  CashEuroNets  post-March  2015  affordability 
review  designed (it says) to comply  with the FCA rules - to derogate  from it. 
With that in mind, and looking  at the way CashEuroNet approved loans from about 
November 2015  I think that a pattern of dependency  was apparent.  Essentially  I think  that 
CashEuroNet ought to have recognised that Mr A was not able to afford some of the loans  in 
a sustainable  fashion. CashEuroNets submissions  in relation to its post-2015  affordability 
review do not remove that requirement to satisfy itself on sustainability. 
Ref: DRN25622637My conclusion having considered all of the information and evidence I have from both parties  
is that I uphold  Mr As complaint in relation to Loans 29 to 44b.
The other aspects  of the complaint relation to Loans 1 to 28 remain  as before with no 
changes or alterations, including an endorsement of the offers  made by CashEuroNet in 
relation to Loans 12 to 23 inclusive. 
putting things right
Because CashEuroNet  should not have given  Mr A some of the loans he took, its not right 
that Mr A should have  to pay interest  or charges on these, or have them affect  his credit file 
in a negative way. Then I think  it should do as follows:
refund  any interest and charges  already  paid by Mr A in respect  of Loans 12 to 23 
and 29 to 44b; and       
apply 8% simple interest  per year to any interest  and charges refunded from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse payment information  about  Loans 12 to 23 and 29 to 44b from 
Mr As credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest and it must 
give Mr A a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr As complaint in part against  CashEuroNet UK LLC and 
direct that it does as I have set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  on or before 23 February 2019.
