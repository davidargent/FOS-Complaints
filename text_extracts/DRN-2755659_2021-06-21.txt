The complaint
Mr B says PDL Finance Limited trading as Mr Lender lent to him irresponsibly. He says that

Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint.  He thought that Mr Lender wasnt wrong to 
approve loans 1 to 3 and 8 to 10. But he thought it should pay compensation in respect of 
loans 4 to 7 and 11 to 13. Mr B agreed with what the adjudicator said. 
Mr Lender agreed in part with the adjudicators opinion. It agreed to pay compensation in 
respect of loans 11 to 13 on the same basis as the adjudicator recommended. But, in 
respect of loans 4 to 7 it said that: 
it was too early in the lending relationship to have found out about Mr Bs gambling 
and other financial problems
Mr B confirmed that he wasnt using the short-term lending for gambling 
it accounted for his other short-term loans in its application process 
it didnt think Mr B was reliant on the lending at loan 7 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr B 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Mr Bs complaint in part and have explained why below.
Mr B didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion not to uphold loans 1 to 3 and 8 to 10. 
Because of this I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. But, for 
the avoidance of doubt I agree with the conclusions our adjudicator reached for the same 
reasons. And they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr B had with Mr Lender. So, they 
are something I will take into account when considering the other loans he took. 
And Mr Lender has agreed to pay compensation in respect of loans 11 to 13. I agree this is 
as fair way to resolve this part of Mr Bs complaint with respect to these loans. Ive included 
loans 11 to 13 in my putting things right section below.  
Loans 4 to 7This was Mr Bs fourth loan in just over nine months. I think this is a relatively long period of 
time - in respect of using short-term high-cost credit  to be making loan repayments. There 
had been no breaks in the lending up to this point. And Mr B was making a commitment to 
make repayments for a further six months.   
So, I think Mr Lender couldve realised at that time that Mr B may have some longer-term 
financial problems and he wasnt just using the loans to help with a temporary cash flow 
problem. Mr Lender shouldve also become concerned about whether it knew enough about 
Mr Bs true financial situation. 
I think that it wouldve been proportionate to fully review Mr Bs financial situation. And I think 
that it needed to verify the information it found out where possible. This is to make sure Mr B 
was in position to make the repayments sustainably. 
I dont think Mr Lender did this. It seemed to largely rely on the information Mr B told it. So, I 
need to think about what Mr Lender wouldve seen if it had carried out proportionate checks. 
Mr B has provided some information about his financial circumstances at the time of loan 4 
which includes his bank statements. I accept that this isnt exactly what Mr Lender wouldve 
seen at the time. But I think it wouldve found out similar information if it had made 
proportionate checks, so I think its reasonable to rely on it.
Mr Lender recorded Mr Bs monthly income to be around £1,450 but it looks to have been 
somewhere between around £1,000 to £1,250 in the run up to loan 4. Putting this against his 
recorded expenditure of £750 means that he mayve, at times, struggled to make the loan 
repayments. 
But added to this was that Mr B was using other short-term lenders. I and can see regular 
repayments to at least two other short-term lenders and there is also some other use of high 
cost credit. 
And by this stage, I think proportionate checks wouldve also shown Mr Lender that a 
substantial portion of Mr Bs income was being spent on gambling. Ive seen times where he 
spent more than his income in one month around the same time as these loans. And I think 
that if Mr Lender wouldve seen this, it wouldnt have thought it was responsible to lend to 
Mr B because of this.
I do accept that Mr Lender found out some basic information about his other lending and 
asked if he was using the loans to fund gambling. But, to reiterate what I said earlier, I dont 
think its checks went far enough. It shouldve done more than ask Mr B what look to be 
standard, non-personalised, questions. And then rely on what he told it. It should have asked 
Mr B for, or obtained, further information. 
I think that Mr Lender wouldve found out the information Ive referred to above if it had made 
proportionate checks. And I think Mr Lender wouldve seen Mr B wouldnt have been able 
repay the loans 4 to 6 in a sustainable way. So, I think that Mr Lender shouldnt have given 
these loans to Mr B and I think hes lost out as a result of this. 
Ive also considered the pattern of lending up to loan 7. I think the lending history and pattern 
of lending itself clearly demonstrates that further lending would likely be unsustainable. Mr B 
had been in debt to Mr Lender for around two and half years at this point and loan 7 was his 
largest loan yet. Whilst I appreciate that Mr B stopped lending for a period after this loan 
there was no indication he would do this when this loan was started.  So, I think Mr Lender 
was irresponsible to approve this loan for this reason as well.So, Im upholding Mr Bs complaint about loans 4 to 7. Mr Lender should put things right in 
respect of these loans. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Mr Lender should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it not approved loans 4 to 7 and loans 11 to 13, as Im satisfied it 
ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. For 
example, having been declined this lending Mr B may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Mr B in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mr B would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Mr Lenders liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
Mr Lender shouldnt have given Mr B loans 4 to 7 and 11 to 13. 
A) Mr Lender should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr B towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B) Mr Lender should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr B 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr B originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Mr Lender should pay Mr B the total of A plus B.
D) Mr Lender should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Mr Bs credit file in 
relation to loans 4 to 6 and 11 to 12. The overall pattern of Mr Bs borrowing for loans 7 and 
13 means any information recorded about them is adverse, so it should remove these loans 
entirely from Mr Bs credit file. If Mr Lender has sold any of the loans Mr Lender should ask 
the debt purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to deduct tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
should give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax Mr Lender has deducted, if they ask for 
one.
My final decisionFor the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mr Bs complaint.
PDL Finance Limited trading as Mr Lender should put things right by doing what Ive said 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 July 2021.
