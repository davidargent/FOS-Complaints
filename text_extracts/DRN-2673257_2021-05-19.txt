The complaint
Mr and Mrs M have complained about how Lloyds Bank PLC changed their bank account. 
What happened
Mr and Mrs M say that their joint bank account changed to a joint Club Lloyds account in 
2017. They say that only Mr M approved this in writing, and Lloyds didnt invite Mrs M to also 
sign the contract.
The adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint, so the matter has been passed to me for a 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Lloyds says that Mr and Mrs M had a joint Vantage account which was changed to a joint 
Club Lloyds account, and that the terms and conditions of joint accounts allow it to accept 
authorisation for certain changes from just one of the account holders. It says this is why it 
didnt need Mrs M to sign. 
I have looked at the terms and conditions that were applicable when the change happened. 
These make clear that Lloyds can change the account in the way it did, with the authority of 
just one of the joint account holders. 
I dont have any evidence to suggest it was unreasonable in the circumstances for Lloyds to 
have relied on this provision; nor to have suspected that Mr M might be going against 
Mrs Ms wishes. If Mr and Mrs M are unhappy giving each other this authority, then it will be 
open to them to end their joint banking arrangements. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I am not upholding this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M and Mrs M to 
accept or reject my decision before 16 June 2021.
