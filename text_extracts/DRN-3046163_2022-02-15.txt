The complaint
Mr and Mrs D complaint that National Westminster Bank Plc will not allow them to port the 
mortgage and were responsible for an unreasonable delay in processing the application and 
they had to pay an early repayment charge (ERC).
What happened
Mr and Mrs D had a repayment mortgage with NatWest and in April 2021 they wanted to buy 
another property. Mr and Mrs D also had a mortgage product and if they redeemed the 
mortgage within the fixed term period, they would have to pay an ERC unless the mortgage 
product could be ported. Porting was subject to the new application meeting NatWests 
lending criteria at the time of application. Mr and Mrs D applied to NatWest for a mortgage 
on the new property. 
NatWest engaged a valuer who said that the property was a self-build and didnt fit within 
NatWests lending criteria. Mr and Mrs D disagreed, and the matter wasnt resolved for 
several weeks and Mr and Mrs D looked elsewhere for a mortgage. NatWest accepted that 
there were unreasonable delays in processing the application and offered Mr and Mrs D 
compensation of £150 but they had to pay the ERC of £2,175.96. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that this complaint should be upheld as he felt that NatWest had offered 
appropriate compensation. Mr and Mrs D dont agree saying in summary that the real 
problem was NatWests failure to come to a decision on the matter which meant that they 
had to go to another lender and pay the ERC. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs D were keen to purchase a new house and approached NatWest for a 
mortgage. The problem was that the valuer who valued the property in early April said that it 
didnt meet NatWests lending criteria being described as self-build without it being lived in 
for a period of two years. Mr and Mrs Ds broker then raised an objection to this 
categorisation of the property. NatWest passed these objections to the valuer and on 19 
April, NatWest asked Mr and Mrs Ds broker for copies of documents the technical team 
needed to review the valuation. I see that these were supplied but at the time Mr and Mrs D 
were looking for a quick response as they felt that the sale would fall through. I note that at 
the end of April they were waiting for NatWests underwriter to make a definitive decision. As 
they heard nothing back from the underwriter, they cancelled the application.
The problem for Mr and Mrs D is that in order to port the mortgage product they needed to 
apply for a new mortgage on the property they intended to buy. NatWest will not lend on 
every property and it has lending criteria which determines which properties it will and will 
not lend on. Ive seen this criteria and that says that it wont accept self-build properties built 
within the last two years. NatWest asked for a valuation and the valuer told NatWest that the 
property didnt meet its lending criteria. In order to check that I asked the valuer to provide 
documentation to clarify that. Among those documents - which I assume were provided to 
the valuer by Mr and Mrs D via NatWest was a Completion Certificate from Building Control 
dated 6 January 2020 with a description of the property as a Self-Build Detached House. 
Given what it says on the certificate, its date and the fact that the inspection was done on 6 
January 2020 I have to accept that the property was a self-build, not lived in for two years at 
the time of application and so, it didnt meet NatWests lending criteria at the time. So, I cant 
say that NatWest acted unfairly in refusing the new mortgage application and not allowing Mr 
and Mrs D to port their mortgage product.
Mr and Mrs Ds other issue is one of delay in NatWest reviewing the issue after the valuer 
came to his initial conclusion that the property wasnt suitable mortgage security in 
accordance with the banks criteria.  Mr and Mrs D seem to have acted swiftly in submitting 
further information to NatWest but were left waiting until the end of April for a response 
under pressure from others involved in the chain and a possibility of missing the stamp duty 
holiday. Mr and Mrs D were left very frustrated as to how the issue of whether it qualified or 
not was dealt with as they kept being asked for further information and there was evidence 
of some information not being passed on promptly. 
NatWest has accepted that it could have provided a better service and paid £150. There is 
no question that Mr and Mrs D didnt get the service they should have expected after they 
asked for a review. I note that in their email of 13 September 2021 that they feel that the 
£150 doesnt compensate them for the ERC of over £2,000 that they had to pay. But as I say 
above Mr and Mrs Ds application to port did not meet NatWests lending criteria and it was 
this that led them to pay the ERC not the delay in reviewing the application. As I understand 
it the delay whilst frustrating, did not in fact affect their chain and didnt prevent them 
benefiting from the Stamp Duty holiday. My view is that in the circumstances the £150 paid 
represents fair compensation and for the reasons set out above I cant fairly uphold this 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D and Mr D to 
accept or reject my decision before 15 March 2022.
