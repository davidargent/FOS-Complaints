K821x#15complaint
Mr J complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC trading as QuickQuid and Pounds  to Pocket, 
(CEN) gave him loans  that were unaffordable. He also says CEN  wouldve realised this had 
it carried out sufficient  checks.

Pounds to Pocket provided  Mr J with instalment  loans that were  due to be repaid over 12 
months. When Mr J refinanced his first and second loan he borrowed additional principle and 
also extended the term of the loan for an additional  12 repayments. 
QuickQuid provided  Mr J with just one payday  loan. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mr Js complaint and she thought that CEN  had carried  out 
sufficient checks when  deciding to lend loans 1 and 2. So she didnt  think  CEN had done 
anything wrong. 
However, she didnt  think  that CENs checks had gone far enough for the remaining loans. 
She thought  about a number of factors  including;
the continued nature of Mr Js borrowing which may have indicated  he was becoming 
dependent on this type of high cost short term credit  
the length of time Mr J borrowed from CEN  
the fact he had a payday loan at the same time as having instalment loans. 
The adjudicator then reviewed Mr Js financial position and she concluded that had CEN 
carried out proportionate checks, it wouldve likely  have found  out that loans 5 and 6 werent 
affordable for Mr J  taking into account  his income,  living costs and his other  short term 
credit commitments.  So she upheld Mr Js complaint in relation  to these loans. 
Ref: DRN56402992CEN responded to the adjudicator and said that it didnt think it had done  anything wrong. 
But, in order  to resolve the complaint  CEN would agree to the settlement of the case  in line 
with what the adjudicator  said. When  CEN agreed  to this  in October 2018 the offer was 
broken down as follows;
interest and charges  - £563.46
8% simple - £164.72
minus 20% tax - £32.94  
therefore the total due to be paid to Mr J was £695.23.  
However, on review of the offer, the adjudicator didnt think  CEN had calculated the redress 
correctly. To her, it seemed that CEN had only offered Mr J a refund for the interest  and 
charges on loan 6 (along with 8% simple interest)  and had not made an offer in relation to 
loan 5. 
This was queried with CEN and it went  onto explain that the reason why no further interest 
refund was due on loan 5 was because we didnt  uphold  loan 3. Based on the credit 
agreement for loan 3, CEN had expected to collect £1.146.61 in interest. But as Mr J had 
repaid loan 3 early,  this amount of interest wasnt collected. So CEN felt it had lost that 
money and, in these  circumstances,  even though  some  interest  was paid by Mr J on loan 5, 
CEN didnt  feel that it needed to provide any further refund.
 
Our adjudicator didnt  think this was quite right and Mr J also didnt accept the settlement 
offer in relation to loan 6 and asked for an ombudsman  to consider the complaint. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive carefully thought about everything 
Ive been given and having  done so, Im partly upholding Mr Js complaint and Ill explain 
why below. 
I want to be clear, that based  on what Ive read there  doesnt  seem to be a dispute  over 
which loans were or were  not irresponsibly given. Instead, this case has been passed to me 
because there is a dispute  about how CEN has calculated  the redress  so in this decision I 
will be focussing on that. 
In addition, CENs offer, based on the figures  from October 2018, seems  accurate in relation 
to the redress due for loan 6. So I have no concerns over how CEN is proposing to put 
things right in relation  to this loan. 
However, there is clearly  a dispute  about  whether any refund should  be provided to Mr J in 
relation to loan 5 (a refinance of loan 3). Based on what  Ive seen I dont think  CEN has 
worked out the redress correctly for this loan and Ill explain  why below.
CENs main  argument is that, because  weve agreed that loan 3 was likely affordable for 
Mr J, were effectively  agreeing that it could charge interest in the sum of £1,146.61  on a 
loan of £1,150 making  a total repayment of £2,296.61.  This appears to have been the 
contractual amount due, had Mr J made his repayments on time and in line with the 
schedule of payments.  And I accept that this wouldve been the total amount hed paid had 
the above happened. However, that isnt what happened in this case, because Mr J settled 
loan 3 early,  and of course, with CENs agreement to that and the terms that came with it. 
Ref: DRN56402993Three months after taking  out loan 3, Mr J refinanced this loan and drew down a further  
£120 in principal. At this point a new loan agreement was created  and the one in relation  to 
loan 3 was settled. Based on the email  CEN  sent to Mr J, this new agreement (loan 5) was 
for a total principal  sum of £1,147.59  with £1,167.83  of interest  making a total amount to be 
repaid of £2,315.42. 
Again, this wouldve been what  Mr J wouldve been expected to have paid  had he made  all 
his payments on time, without incurring any other late fees or default sums, and if the loan 
had run to the planned term. But, like loan 3, three months after agreeing to this loan, Mr J 
settled loan 5 early. Which he was entitled to do, and to which CEN agreed. 
 
So thinking  about the above argument  as to why no refund is due for loan 5, I cant agree 
with CEN  about  the amount of interest  it says it was entitled  to collect.  As Ive said above, 
when loans 3 and 5 were  approved it was expected  that Mr J would run these loans in line 
with the credit agreement. And the payment Mr J made to settle loan 5 (agreed  with CEN, of 
course) was larger than it would have been  originally anticipated because it included  interest 
on the extra money, Mr J borrowed for this loan (£120). Interest on the £120 shouldnt be 
payable because we dont think the loan shouldve been given. Thats  the crux of the matter.  
So while I can see that CEN didnt receive  the amount  of interest  it may have expected  
under either of the agreements for loans 3 and 5 - this in itself is not a reason to not provide 
a refund for loan 5.  
As Ive said above,  CEN couldve expected Mr J to pay the interest outlined  in the 
agreements if the loans had run to term. But they didnt  and those early settlements were  
with CENs agreement on CENs terms. Under these circumstances, it isnt fair to say that no 
refund is due for loan 5 because of this, particularly when the settlement figure included 
interest on the £120 drawdown that we dont think shouldve been  given. 
So I think CEN is wrong in what it says about  not being in a position to refund Mr J any 
interest due on loan 5. So Ive had to think about  what it needs to do, in this case, to put 
things right for Mr J. 
what CEN  should do to put things  right
CEN needs to refund  any interest and charges payable on loan 5 as a result of the refinance  
and the additional £120.  This makes  sure that the consumer gets a refund for the extra 
interest paid due to the further  amount borrowed and the time extension  to the initial  loan (3).
So, for example,  if loan 3 had run to term, then CEN wouldve needed to have worked  out 
the interest and fees payable on this loan (to the original term) and then any extra amount 
that was paid on loan 5. And then this figure  is effectively the overpayment made by Mr J 
which should be refunded as normal.  
However, in this case, CEN shouldnt use the intended term of loan 3 because  this loan 
didnt run to term. The effect of this calculation should be the total interest actually paid on 
loans 3 and 5 less any charges and interest due on loan 3 alone.  
To put things right for Mr J, CEN should:
Ref: DRN56402994refund the interest and charges paid by Mr J on loans 5  (in line with the above) and 6, 
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement ; and
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Js credit  file about these loans.
HM Revenue & Customs requires CEN to take off tax from this interest. CEN must give 
Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, I partly uphold Mr Js complaint. 
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right for Mr J as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 April 2019.
