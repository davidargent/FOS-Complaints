K821x#15complaint
Its been agreed in this case that NewDay Ltd should  accept responsibility  for the complaint. To 
keep things simple, Ill refer to NewDay Ltd as the seller  in my decision.
Mr S says NewDay Ltd mis-sold him a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy on a store  
card.
background
This complaint is about a PPI policy taken out on a store  account  in 2002.
The policy cost was £0.39 per £100  Mr S owed on his store card.  The policy  would have paid 3% 
of the outstanding balance on the card each month if Mr S couldnt work because  he had an 
accident, was unwell  or lost his job. 
Our adjudicator upheld  the complaint. NewDay Ltd disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion,  so 
the complaint  has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and reasonable in 
the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and Ive 
taken this into account in deciding Mr S case.  
I am upholding  Mr S complaint. Ill explain the reasons why Ive reached this conclusion.
This policy was taken out by completing  an application form and returning  it by post. It is clear 
then that no advice was given and the policy wasnt recommended  to Mr S. So Mr S didnt have 
to check that the policy was right for Mr S, but it did need to give him clear enough information  to 
enable him to decide for himself if this cover was right for him.
I dont think that Mr S was given  clear information about the cost of the policy,  in real terms. Its 
possible NewDay Ltd may have explained the amount he would  pay for each pound he spent on 
the card, but Ive seen  insufficient evidence that it did. And I dont know if it explained that interest  
would be charged  on those premiums if there was an outstanding balance  or that he would need 
to keep paying the premiums during a claim,  or if it provided an easily understandable monthly  
cost based on various  monthly amounts spent on the card.  So I think  that each of the above are 
sufficient in themselves  to make me think its likely  Mr S would not have been made aware of the 
true cost of the policy in real terms.
I think this would have  mattered to Mr S as he has told us that he would have received sick pay 
for up to a year if he was too ill to work,  and six months of that sick pay would have been at his 
full rate of pay. I am aware that the cost of the policy was relatively  low, but so was the benefit. 
And given  what Mr S has told us about  his employee benefits, I dont think  that Mr S would have 
thought the policy was value for money if he had fully understood the costs.
So, overall, based on what Ive seen and been told, I dont think NewDay Ltd gave clear  enough  
information to Mr S to enable him to decide if the policy  was right for him. And, if it had, I dont 
Ref: DRN10538402think he would have  taken  the policy out as I dont think  he would have considered  it value for 
money. So I think Mr S has lost out as a result  of what NewDay  Ltd did wrong.
putting things right
I dont know if the store  card is still open  or if it has been closed. So Ive set out the compensation 
that would  need to be paid out in either scenario.
If the account has been closed:
NewDay Ltd should put Mr S in the financial position  hed be in now if he hadnt  taken  out PPI.
A.NewDay Ltd should  find out how much  Mr S would have owed when he closed his store card 
account if the policy hadnt  been  added.
So, it should  remove the PPI premiums added, as well as any interest charged  on those 
premiums. It should also remove any charges that were caused  by the mis-sale of the PPI  
as well as any interest  added to those charges. 
NewDay Ltd should then refund the difference between what  Mr S owed when he closed his 
account and what  he would have owed if he hadnt  had PPI.
If Mr S made a successful  claim under  the PPI policy, NewDay Ltd can take off what  he got 
for the claim from the amount it owes him.  
B.NewDay Ltd should  add simple interest on the difference between what Mr S would have 
owed when he closed his account  from when  he closed it until he gets the refund. The 
interest rate should  be 8% a year. 
C.If  when  NewDay  Ltd works  out what Mr S would have owed each month without PPI  Mr S 
paid more than enough  to clear  his balance, NewDay  Ltd should also pay simple interest on 
the extra Mr S paid. And it should  carry on paying interest until the point when  Mr S would 
have owed NewDay Ltd something on his store card. The interest rate should be 8% a year. 
D.NewDay Ltd should  tell Mr S what its done to work out A, B and C.
 HM Revenue  & Customs  requires FICL to take off tax from this interest. NewDay Ltd must  give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
If the account is still open:
NewDay Ltd should put Mr S in the financial position  hed be in now if he hadnt  taken  out PPI. 
The policy should  be cancelled  if it hasnt  been  cancelled already and:
A. NewDay Ltd should find out how much  Mr S would owe on his store  card if the policy 
hadnt been added to it.
So, it should  remove the PPI premiums added, as well as any interest charged  on those 
premiums. It should also remove any charges that were caused  by the mis-sale of the PPI  
as well as any interest  added to those charges.
Ref: DRN10538403NewDay Ltd should then refund the difference between what  Mr S owes  and what  he would 
have owed.
If Mr S made a successful  claim under  the PPI policy, NewDay Ltd can take off what  he got 
for the claim from the amount it owes him.
B. If  when NewDay Ltd works out what Mr S would have owed  each month without PPI  
Mr S paid more than enough  to clear his balance, NewDay Ltd should  also pay simple interest 
on the extra Mr S paid. And it should  carry on paying interest until the point when Mr S 
wouldve owed NewDay Ltd something  on his store card.  The interest rate should  be 8% a 
year. 
C. NewDay Ltd should tell Mr S what its done  to work out A and B.
 HM Revenue  & Customs  requires NewDay Ltd to take off tax from this interest. NewDay Ltd 
must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I uphold Mr S complaint  against  NewDay  Ltd and require them  to 
pay Mr S compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 February  2020.
