The complaint
Its been agreed AXA France IARD should accept responsibility for this complaint. To keep 
things simpler, Ill refer to AXA as the seller of the PPI in my decision.
Mr T says AXA mis-sold him payment protection insurance (PPI).
What happened
In August 1995 Mr T took out a store card with PPI whilst he was out shopping. 
Among other things, Mr T told us that when he took out the PPI he had a long term health 
problem following an injury in 1990.
One of our adjudicators investigated and she upheld Mr Ts complaint. 
Our adjudicator said she didnt think Mr T wouldve taken out the insurance if AXA had made 
him aware that the policy wouldnt have covered accident and sickness claims for any health 
problem Mr T had when he bought it.
AXA disagrees with our adjudicators view. AXA mainly says that theres nothing to suggest 
the severity of Mr Ts condition following his injury and the prolonged effect it had on his 
ability to work at the point of sale or after. 
AXA says he couldve made other claims on the policy. And AXA wanted to see more 
information about another condition Mr T had also mentioned which affected him in 1995. 
AXA didnt agree to uphold this complaint as it didnt think there was evidence that Mr Ts 
medical condition would negate his need for the policy. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account here.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold Mr Ts complaint. Ill explain why.
AXA needed to give Mr T enough clear information about the PPI for him to be able to make 
an informed choice about whether it was right for him. 
Mr T told us that hed suffered an injury in 1990. He said that whilst he managed the 
resulting health problems this caused him with pain killers hed also had to take time off work 
from time to time. And he told us those issues were ongoing. 
AXA hasnt been able to provide us with a policy document from the exact date when Mr T 
took out this PPI. But it has provided a policy document which was in use shortly afterwards. 
So I think its likely that the policy Mr T took out wouldve had substantially the same terms 
and conditions. 
It looks like the policy Mr T bought wouldve excluded cover for accident and sickness claims 
for Mr Ts health problems resulting from the injury he had in 1990. I think this wouldve been 
an important consideration for Mr T. His condition had led to him being off work sick on 
occasions following his injury. And when he took out this PPI in 1995, I think Mr T might 
reasonably have expected that his health condition could potentially continue to have a 
significant impact on his day to day life and lead to him needing to take more time off work.
But I dont know exactly what was said when the policy was sold to Mr T. And theres nothing 
obvious on the application he filled in to have the policy added on to his store card account 
which highlighted the limitation for a pre-existing medical condition. So I cant see how or if 
AXA drew this information to his attention as it shouldve done. And, if it had, I think its likely 
that Mr T wouldnt have bought the policy. 
Ive taken carefully into account what AXA has said in response to our adjudicators opinion. 
But this doesn't affect my overall view. Based on all the information I've seen already, I think 
Mr T has lost out because of what AXA did wrong and it should put things right. 
Putting things right
AXA should put Mr T in the financial position hed be in now if he hadnt taken out PPI. How 
it does this will depend on whether Mr Ts store card account is still active or has been 
closed.
I understand that the policy has already been cancelled (if not, the policy should be 
cancelled if it hasnt been cancelled already).
If Mr Ts account is still active:
A. AXA should find out how much Mr T would owe on his store card if the policy hadnt 
been added to it.
So, it should remove the PPI premiums added, as well as any interest charged on those 
premiums. It should also remove any charges that were caused by the mis-sale of the 
PPI  as well as any interest added to those charges.
AXA should then refund the difference between what Mr T owes and what he would have 
owed.
If Mr T made a successful claim under the PPI policy, AXA can take off what he got for 
the claim from the amount it owes him.
B. If  when AXA works out what Mr T would have owed each month without PPI  Mr T 
paid more than enough to clear his balance, AXA should also pay simple interest on the 
extra Mr T paid. And it should carry on paying interest until the point when Mr T wouldve 
owed AXA something on his store card. The interest rate should be 8% a year.
C. AXA should tell Mr T what its done to work out A and B.
If Mr Ts account has been closed: A. AXA should find out how much Mr T would have owed when he closed his store card 
account if the policy hadnt been added.
So, it should remove the PPI premiums added, as well as any interest charged on those 
premiums. It should also remove any charges that were caused by the mis-sale of the 
PPI  as well as any interest added to those charges. 
AXA should then refund the difference between what Mr T owed when he closed his 
account and what he would have owed if he hadnt had PPI.
If Mr T made a successful claim under the PPI policy, AXA can take off what he got for 
the claim from the amount it owes him.  
B. AXA should add simple interest on the difference between what Mr T would have owed 
when he closed his account from when he closed it until he gets the refund. The interest 
rate should be 8% a year.
C. If  when AXA works out what Mr T would have owed each month without PPI  Mr T 
paid more than enough to clear the balance, AXA should also pay simple interest on the 
extra Mr T paid. And it should carry on paying interest until the point when Mr T 
wouldve owed AXA something on his store card. The interest rate should be 8% a 
year.
D. AXA should tell Mr T what its done to work out A, B and C.
If the lender has already repaid any commission amount to Mr T that relates to this PPI sale, 
that sum can be deducted by AXA from the redress shown above.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires AXA to take off tax from this interest. AXA must give 
Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, I uphold Mr Ts complaint and AXA France IARD should put 
things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 November 2020.
