K820x#14complaint
Mr P complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest)  passed a debt to a third 
party without his knowledge.
background
Mr P had an account with NatWest. He didnt realise itd gone overdrawn. And hes unhappy 
NatWest sold the debt to another  company without discussing  it with him. The bank also 
passed on his details to the debt company who contacted his family. Mr P feels this is a 
breach of data security.
NatWest said Mr Ps account became overdrawn in November 2016.  Itd sent Mr P a number 
of letters  about  the situation. And itd sent him regular account statements showing the 
current position. But Mr P had changed address and not informed the bank. So he hadnt 
received the letters. 
Because Mr P hadnt responded NatWest sold the debt to a third party. The decision was 
part of its debt recovery process. NatWest acknowledged that Mr P was unhappy  his family 
had been contacted by the debt recovery company. But that was something he would have 
to discuss directly with them. 
Mr P wasnt  satisfied with NatWests response. So he contacted our service  and our 
investigator looked into the matter. He felt Mr P shouldve been aware his account  had gone 
overdrawn. Hed used  it regularly until that point.  And hed made a deposit  in December 
2016 to reduce the balance. Our investigator  didnt feel he could hold NatWest responsible 
for Mr P not receiving the letters about his unauthorised overdraft.  Theyd been sent to the 
address Mr P had provided. 
Our investigator looked at the terms and conditions of the account. He felt NatWest  had 
acted correctly when  it passed the debt to the third party and provided Mr Ps details. And he 
didnt feel he couldnt hold NatWest responsible the company contacting Mr Ps family.
Mr P didnt agree. He said the letters sent to his previous address wouldve been returned to 
NatWest. And NatWest couldnt  provide  copies  of the statements it said had been sent. So 
hes asked for an ombudsmans final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr P is unhappy a debt arose on his NatWest account. Although hed changed  address from 
his parents house hes sure that letters from the bank wouldve  been returned to it. Mr P 
remembers other businesses called to remind him to update his address details. So Ive 
looked carefully at everything Mr P and NatWest  have  said.
Mr Ps account became  overdrawn in November 2016. He did make a deposit  of Â£30 in 
December which suggests  he was aware  his account needed funds. Although  Mr P had 
used the account on a regular basis there  were  no more transactions  after it became 
overdrawn. The only other activity on the account relates to bank charges for the 
unauthorised overdraft.
Ref: DRN80170352So I think its reasonable to assume Mr P wouldve been aware his account  had gone  into 
debit. He stopped using  the account as soon as it did. NatWest sent Mr P a number of letters 
asking him to get in touch. And the letters explained what  would happen  to the account if the 
bank didnt hear from him. 
NatWest said it also sent statements  to Mr P. The bank hasnt been able to provide evidence  
to support this. But theres nothing on its records to suggest they werent sent as normal.  
The terms and conditions  of the account say NatWest would provide monthly statements 
unless agreed  otherwise.  But unfortunately Mr P wasnt using his parents address anymore. 
And he hadnt told the bank about his change of address. 
I realise Mr P says he was chased by other organisations when they realised he was using a 
different address to the one they had on their records. But it was Mr Ps responsibility to 
update his bank when  he changed address. He knew he had an account with NatWest. And 
its likely  he knew  he had gone into an unauthorised overdraft. So I cant  say NatWest  did 
anything wrong  by trying to contact Mr P about his account and passing the debt to a third 
party when he didnt  respond.  The bank acted within the terms and conditions of the account  
which Mr P agreed to when he opened the account. 
The terms say NatWest  can share Mr Ps details  with certain  third parties  such as debt 
collection agencies. So I dont think NatWest did anything wrong  by providing Mr Ps last 
known address to the debt company. It provided the only contact details it had. I realise this 
mightve caused some upset to Mr Ps family. But NatWest had no other address to pass on.
Based on what Ive seen  I cant really  say NatWest has done  anything wrong. I appreciate  
how upsetting  it mustve been  for Mr P to discover he had a debt.  And itd been  passed to a 
collection agency. But Mr Ps expenditure caused his account  to become overdrawn. And he 
stopped using the account soon afterwards. Mr P didnt inform the bank when he changed 
address. And he couldve checked his account and put things right before the debt was sold.
I realise Mr P will be disappointed with this outcome. But, for the reasons Ive given, I dont 
uphold this complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 May 2019.
