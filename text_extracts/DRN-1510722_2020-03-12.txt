The complaint
Mrs C complains that AXA France IARD mis-sold the late Mr C a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy. 
What happened
Mr C bought the policy in 2001 at the same time as taking out a store card. 
Our adjudicator didn't uphold the complaint. Mr C disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mr Cs case.
Ive decided not to uphold Mr Cs complaint for the following reasons. 
Mr C signed his application form to specifically indicate that he wanted PPI  separately to 
where he signed to apply for the card. So, I think AXA made Mr C aware that he had a 
choice about buying the PPI, and that he chose to take it. 
AXA didn't recommend the PPI to Mr C, so it didn't have to check if it was right for him. 
Its possible the information AXA gave Mr C about the PPI wasn't as clear as it shouldve 
been. But Mr C doesn't appear to have been affected by any of the main things the policy 
didn't cover  and based on what I know about his circumstances it looks like the policy 
couldve been useful to him. So, I dont think better information wouldve stopped him buying 
it. 
Ive taken into account Mr Cs comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
 
 
 
 
 
 My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C on behalf of 
the estate of Mr C to accept or reject my decision before 9 April 2020.
