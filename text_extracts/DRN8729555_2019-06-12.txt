K821x#15complaint
Mr F complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  approved loans which  
were not affordable. Mr F says that QuickQuid did not undertake affordability checks  for 
each loan or rollover of a loan. It did not adequately assess signs of his over indebtedness. 
As a result Mr F says he was in a debt  spiral.  
background
Using the information from the QuickQuid  statements of account for Mr F I have created a 
brief Loan  Table which appears at the end of this decision. 
Mr F declared his monthly net income as being £1,034  in February 2015 to February 2016, 
then just under £1,300 from February  2016 to February 2017. Then as just over £1,400 from 
February 2017.
Mr F declared his monthly expenditure as £275  between February  2015  and October  2016,  
then £325 until October  2017. 
One of our adjudicators looked  at this complaint, considering the submissions and views of 
both parties and he came to the opinion that from Loan 11 in May 2016 QuickQuid ought to 
have ceased lending. He thought that by this date QuickQuid ought to have realised that 
Mr F was reliant on its high-cost short term credit and that is was unsustainable or otherwise  
harmful. He thought that QuickQuid should  put things right in relation to Loans 11 to 27. 
QuickQuid responded  with extensive  submissions to demonstrate  its case that it had carried  
out appropriate and proportionate  affordability assessments.  
It went on to explain that 
QuickQuid uses validated  data in order to determine the customers  estimated  
disposable income (EDI). QuickQuid only makes loans where total payments are less 
than 80% of the customers total EDI for the term of the loan. This assessment, 
including the validation of expenses and income is conducted on each loan 
application. 
And EDI is QuickQuids reference to its calculation of what  it views to have been Mr Fs 
estimated disposable income . 
It made  reference to a question box on the application form for what  looks  to have been 
Loan 1 asking Mr F to acknowledge  that what he had provided was accurate and truthful 
but there is no indication as to what Mr F had responded and whether that was just for one 
loan (feasibly Loan  1) or all - so I attach little weight  to it. 
QuickQuid attached a document which it referred  to as its entire lending process. And 
QuickQuid refuted the adjudicators view that there  had been irresponsible  lending. 
Mr F is represented  by a third party and on Mr Fs behalf it acknowledged our adjudicators  
opinion, plus QuickQuids  additional submissions and was invited to make further comments 
or add additional evidence  before it being  passed to me. It has not sent anything  and so 
I take it that Mr F has no issue with our adjudicators opinion, is satisfied with it including our 
adjudicators non-uphold  views in relation to Loans 1 to 10. So I do not plan to review  those. 
Ref: DRN87295552The complaint remains unresolved in relation to Loans 11 to 27 and so has been passed  to 
me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mr Fs case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Fs complaint and have explained why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr F 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Fs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Fs complaint.  These questions are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr F would be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr F would  have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Fs indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Fs complaint.
Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr F would be able to repay  in a sustainable way?  If not, would those  checks  have 
shown that Mr F would have been able to do so?
Ref: DRN87295553As outlined  above,  Loans 1 to 10 appear  not to be in dispute any longer and so I say no 
more about them and make no findings. 
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for Loans 11 to 27 because 
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Fs indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise 
harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending. Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which QuickQuid should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Fs case,  I think that this point 
was reached by Loan 11. I say this because:
the amounts  Mr F was borrowing were generally increasing, and QuickQuid ought  to 
have realised it was likely their indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably
by loan 11 QuickQuid  had been lending  to Mr F almost continuously for fourteen  
months many of which had included  multiple top-ups as well 
Mr F wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid. And was in 
effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an extended  period.
I think that Mr F lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from Loan  11 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Fs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans (loans  and top-ups  and some deferrals) was likely to have 
had negative implications on Mr Fs ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept 
him in the market  for these high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  Mr Fs complaint about Loans  11 to 27 because the overall pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
Did Mr F act unfairly  or unreasonably in some  other  way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr F in some 
other way.  
Putting things  right  what  QuickQuid needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr F paid on Loans 11 to 27;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 11 means any information recorded about  them  
is adverse. So all entries about  Loans 11 to 27 should be removed from Mr Fs credit  
file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mr F a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN87295554My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im upholding Mr Fs complaint in 
part. CashEuroNet UK LLC trading  as QuickQuid should do as I have set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service I need to ask Mr F to accept or reject  
my final determination  on or before 12 July 2019.
