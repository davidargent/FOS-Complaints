The complaint
Mr Ls complaint is about contracted out payments from the then Department of Social 
Security (DSS) which shouldve been credited to his pension plan with Merchant Investors 
Assurance Company Limited and later switched to a new provider. 
Merchant Investors Assurance Company Limited is now part of Sanlam Life & Pensions UK 
Limited (Sanlam). 
What happened
Mr L was a member of an employers pension scheme from 6 April 1981 to 29 February 
1988. When Mr L left that employment the pension benefits hed accrued were transferred to 
a section 32 buyout plan with Norwich Union.   
Mr L joined a new employer and became a member of its group personal pension scheme 
with Sanlam (formerly Merchant Investors Assurance Company Ltd). For convenience Ill just 
refer below to the Sanlam plan. I understand that Mr L joined the Sanlam plan in March 1989 
on the first anniversary of his new employment. 
Mr Ls employer later decided to use a different pension provider. Coincidentally Norwich 
Union (now Aviva) was selected. Again Ive just referred to Aviva below. Mr L joined Avivas 
pension scheme in March 1992. His accrued benefits with Sanlam were to be transferred to 
Aviva. 
It seems there were several transfers or switches. The reason for that is unclear. But, in 
October 1992 Sanlam sent a cheque for £4,591.28 to Aviva. In June 1993 Aviva sent Mr L a 
statement for the previous year. It showed the switch payment of £4,591.28, made up of 
£886.08 employer and employee contributions and £3,705.20 protected rights payments, 
received from the DSS.  
Aviva sent a statement to Mr L on 1 June 1995. It showed two further transfer payments 
received on 8 July 1994 of £3,662.10 and £1,251.80 so, in total, £4,913.90. There was a 
further switch payment in February 1995 of £1,211.39. That was a DSS rebate payment 
which Sanlam had received on 22 December 1994 and then forwarded to Aviva. 
In January 1997 Aviva wrote to Mr L to say a payment of £1,241.85 from the DSS for the 
1994/1995 tax year had been received and had been added to his pension plan. The 
enclosed contribution notice showed it had been invested as at 3 July 1995. The payment 
was shown on the June 1997 statement Aviva sent to Mr L. 
In December 2020 Mr L saw a newspaper advertisement which said he may be able to get 
compensation if hed had a pension with Merchant Investors. He emailed Sanlam on 29 
December 2020. He said hed been checking his Aviva pension plan and he asked a number 
of questions about the pension plan hed had with Sanlam earlier, including the total 
contributions paid into the plan, how they were made up (contracted out DSS contributions, 
employer and employee contributions) and the sums paid on transfers out.  
Mr Ls queries were treated as a complaint. Mr L was particularly concerned that a letter 
dated 3 June 1994 from financial advisers (I think acting for Mr Ls employer) had said 
£8,996.18 was to be transferred by Sanlam to the new providers scheme. But Mr L had 
noticed, when checking his Aviva pension plan in December 2020, that only £4,913.90 had 
been transferred.  
Sanlam didnt uphold the complaint. It maintained the payments made to Aviva as the new 
provider had been correct. 
Mr L remained dissatisfied and referred his complaint to us. Our investigator didnt think we 
could look into all aspects of Mr Ls complaint. Sanlam wasnt prepared to consent to us 
dealing with the complaint if it had been made outside the applicable time limits. 
The investigators view was that Mr L had complained too late that the amounts transferred 
by Sanlam to the new provider had been less than hed expected. But the investigator said 
we could consider Mr Ls complaint about the contracted out DSS payments which shouldve 
been credited to his Aviva pension. The investigator said Mr L wasnt given any information 
about the contracted out DSS rebates that were being paid into his pension over the years. 
He wouldnt have had cause to complain that a payment of £1,539 hadnt been switched into 
his Aviva plan at the time. 
The investigator went on to say what he thought about that complaint and why he didnt think 
it should be upheld. He set out a table showing the DSS payments according to HMRCs 
records and as notified to Mr L (HMRCs letters of 14 January 2021 and 4 February 2021) 
and what Sanlam says was paid. For convenience, Ive included the table here.  
Tax year DSS Payment (HMRC) DSS Payment (Sanlam)
86/87 £0 £1,277.86
87/88 £130.06 £0
88/89 £1162.65 £1,214.96
89/90 £1197.70 £1,251.59
90/91 £1338.75 £1398.99
91/92 £1488.10 £367.33
92/93 £1539.84 £1.609.12
93/94 £1211.39 £0
94/95 £1241.85 £0
 The investigator said, about the last two payments shown as having been made by HMRC, 
that Sanlam didnt have any data for the 1993/1994 and 1994/1995 tax years but hed seen 
letters confirming that Sanlam received those payments and switched them to Mr Ls new 
provider. And, if Mr L didnt join the Sanlam plan until June 1990 (I think Mr L says it was 
March 1990) it looked like he was still contracted out after he left his previous employers 
scheme but before he joined the Sanlam plan and the contracted out DSS payments were 
added to the Sanlam plan after hed joined it. The investigator said that Sanlams effective 
dates for the 1986/1987 to 1989/1990 contributions were in 1990 (or later) when Mr L had 
joined the Sanlam plan. 
The investigator thought it fair and reasonable to assume that HMRCs figures were more 
likely to be correct than a private companys figures. Especially as the HMRC figures for the 
1993/1994 and 1994/1995 tax years matched other Sanlam documents but Sanlam didnt 
include these amounts with its figures for the earlier tax years.
So, for the 1986/1987 to 1992/1993 tax years, Mr Ls Sanlam plan got a total of £6,857.10 in 
DSS or protected rights contributions. But Sanlam switched a total of £7,367.30 worth of 
such contributions to his new provider. So he hadnt suffered a financial loss in respect of the 
switched DSS contributions. And there was no evidence the £1,539 protected rights 
contribution for the tax year 1992/1993 hadnt been switched to his new provider.
Because Mr L didnt accept the investigators views, the complaint was referred to me. 
I issued a jurisdiction decision on 6 October 2022. For the reasons I set out I agreed with the 
investigator that Mr L had complained too late that the amounts transferred didnt match the 
£8,996.18 referred to in the letter of 3 June 1994. But I agreed with the investigator that we 
could consider the complaint about the contracted out DSS rebates paid over the years. I 
said Id be going on to consider Mr Ls complaint about the DSS rebates. And that if Mr L or 
Sanlam wanted to add any further comments they should let the investigator know within the 
next seven days. 
In response, Mr L said he was disappointed. He said he hadnt received, at the time, the 
letter Id referred to from Sanlam in October 1992, confirming that switch cheques totalling 
£4,591.28 had been sent to his new provider, although a copy had been provided by Sanlam 
in 2021 when it rejected his complaints. 
Sanlam didnt offer any further comments.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Ive explained, I dont think we can consider all of Mr Ls complaint. I note he didnt 
receive Sanlams letter in October 1992 confirming the amount paid to his new provider. But 
he did get statements from the new provider which showed that £4,591.28 had been 
transferred in 1992 and how it was made up. I maintain, if Mr L thought the amount was too 
low (and, in particular, because he was expecting a payment of £8,996.18), he had sufficient 
information to know what sum had been paid and, if he thought it shouldve been more, to 
query it earlier. As things stood, he didnt complain until December 2020. That was too late  
more than six years after the event complained of and more than three years after Mr L 
became aware (or reasonably ought to have become aware) he had cause for complaint. So all Ive considered is the complaint about the DSS payments. Having done so, I agree 
with the views expressed by the investigator and the reasons he gave as to why the 
complaint couldnt be upheld. I dont have much to add. 
Mr Ls complaint concerns payments made in the late 1980s/early 1990s. Although Mr L may 
regard it as unsatisfactory that Sanlams records arent complete, given the time thats 
elapsed, its probably inevitable that not all of the documentation and records will have 
survived. 
I have to make my decision based on such evidence as is available. As the investigator 
explained, where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory (as some of it is 
here), I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other words what I consider is 
most likely to have happened in the light of the available evidence and the wider 
circumstances. 
As well as the historic nature of the complaint, the position is further complicated by the fact 
that there was often a delay in receipt of the DSS rebates for the tax year in question. The 
letter dated 4 February 2021 from HMRC confirms that  it includes the payment dates 
which are generally some months after the end of the relevant tax year. 
Looking at the table above, I think the last two payments are accounted for. In respect of the 
payment of £1,241.85, HMRCs letters say that payment was made direct to Aviva in July 
1995. As mentioned above, Ive seen that in January 1997 Aviva wrote to Mr L to say a 
payment of £1,241.85 from the DSS for the 1994/1995 tax year had been received which 
had been added to his pension plan. A contribution notice was enclosed and the payment is 
shown on Mr Ls June 1997 statement. So Im satisfied that payment was received by Aviva 
and added to Mr Ls plan. 
It seems the payment of £1,211.39 was made to Sanlam. As mentioned above, Sanlam 
received a DSS rebate payment of £1,211.39 on 22 December 1994 (which is consistent 
with the December 1994 payment date set out in HMRCs letter of 4 February 2021). The 
payment was then forwarded to Aviva and is shown as having been added to Mr Ls pension 
plan in February 1995. So again Im satisfied that payment has been added to Mr Ls plan. 
Mr Ls concerns originally centred on the payment for the 1992/1993 tax year of £1,539.84 
which he suggested had been received by Sanlam but not paid over to his new provider. But 
I think Mr L now accepts that sum is accounted for  Mr L said in response to the 
investigators view that he accepted that the switch payment in July 1994 did include the 
protected rights pension benefits of £1,539.84.  
As to the earlier payments, according to the letters from HMRC, payments were made to 
Sanlam in January 1990 in respect of the tax years 1987/1988 and 1988/1989 of £130.06 
and £1,162.65 respectively. From what Mr L has told us (and as evidenced by the payslips 
hes supplied which show the pension contributions deductions) Mr Ls membership of the 
Sanlam plan didnt start until March 1989. 
He joined his new employer in March 1988 and it seems there was waiting period of a year 
before he was able to join the employers scheme  the Sanlam plan. By January 1990 he 
was a member of Sanlams scheme and it seems the DSS rebates for the two previous tax 
years were issued to Sanlam and not to Mr Ls previous employers scheme. Even if there 
was some irregularity there, whats important is that Sanlam, having received the payments, 
credited them to Mr Ls plan and they were included in the amounts switched to the new 
provider when it took over. As the investigator pointed out, and according to the information from HMRC (whose records 
I agree are likely to be correct) for the tax years 1987/1988 through to 1992/1993, Sanlam 
received DSS rebates totalling £6,857.10. But, according to Sanlams records, it switched a 
total of £7,367.30 to Mr Ls new provider in respect of such contributions. So it doesnt 
appear that there was any underpayment. And the figure of £6,857.10 includes the payment 
of £1,539.84 which Mr L thought at one stage might not have been switched. 
As Ive indicated, the circumstances in which weve come to investigate this complaint arent 
ideal. I think it wouldve been easier to check exactly what payments were made and when 
and how they were made up had less time elapsed. But, based on such evidence as is 
available, I cant say that Sanlam didnt transfer the DSS payments it received for Mr L to his 
new provider. On that basis Im unable to uphold Mr Ls complaint. 
My final decision
I dont uphold the complaint and Im not making any award. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 November 2022.
