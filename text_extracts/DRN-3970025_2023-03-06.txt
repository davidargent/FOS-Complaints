The complaint
Mr H has complained Metro Bank PLC, trading as RateSetter, is holding him liable for a 
personal loan he didnt take out.
What happened
A loan with RateSetter for £5,000 was taken out in Mr Hs name on 15 August 2022. At the 
same time Mr H realised his bank account had been emptied. His bank (who Ill refer to as 
S) confirmed Mr H had been a victim of impersonation and account takeover. Loans had 
been taken out in his name, paid into his account with S and then transferred elsewhere.
Other lenders wrote off loans taken out in Mr Hs name, but RateSetter wouldnt. They 
believed S had been at fault and expected the loan to be repaid.
Dissatisfied, Mr H brought his complaint to the ombudsman service. Our investigator 
confirmed Mr H had not taken out the loan nor signed up to the terms and conditions. 
RateSetter couldnt continue to hold him liable.
RateSetter refused to accept this outcome. Theyve asked an ombudsman to consider the 
complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator. Ill explain why.
Nobody disputes Mr H was a victim of fraud. A third party took out loans in his name and 
managed to get the monies paid into Mr Hs account with S. As this third party also had an 
account with S, they were able to change details on Mr Hs account and transfer loan monies 
to them.
Theres no evidence to indicate Mr H took out the loan with RateSetter. He didnt agree to 
the terms and conditions, nor did he benefit from the money.
Im surprised therefore RateSetter believe they can continue to hold him liable for 
repayment. They dont have grounds for this as all parties accept Mr H didnt take out the 
loan.
I appreciate RateSetter is aggrieved that the money was paid to a third party through no fault 
of their own. They carried out their requisite checks. They believe S are at fault.
That isnt the issue here. Im considering whether RateSetter can hold Mr H liable and Im 
satisfied theres no basis for them to do so.
Putting things right
RateSetter will need to write off the loan in Mr Hs name and stop asking him to repay this. 
They will also need to remove any reference to this loan from Mr Hs credit record.
My final decision
For the reasons given, my final decision is to instruct Metro Bank PLC, trading as 
RateSetter, to:
Write off the personal loan for £5,000 in Mr Hs name;
Stop asking Mr H to repay this loan; and
Remove any reference to this loan from Mr Hs credit record.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 April 2023.
