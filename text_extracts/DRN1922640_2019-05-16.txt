K820x#14complaint
Ms F complains that National  Westminster Bank  Plc raised a fraud  alert when she attempted 
to transfer money  internally between her accounts.  She is also unhappy that she 
encountered difficulties  in escalating her complaint. 
background
On 8 December  2018 Ms F attempted to transfer money online from her NatWest current 
account to her savings  account. NatWest said this payment  was subject to a security  check  
as it was concerned  the transfer may not have been genuine. And Ms Fs online banking 
facility was suspended until NatWest could  confirm with her that the payment was genuine.
Ms F contacted the fraud department and was asked to pass  enhanced security  as part of 
NatWests security measures. She said she experienced long delays when trying to contact 
the fraud department and received poor treatment when  speaking with that department. But 
NatWest said Ms F wasnt able to successfully  answer the identification  questions  it asked 
her. So, she was asked to visit a branch to confirm her identity. 
On 9 December  2018 Ms F attended  a NatWest branch and provided proof of her identity.  
While there  explained  she said she told NatWest she wanted to lodge a complaint about 
what had happened . But she said she was told here was no one available  to record  her 
complaint. Ms F said, instead, she was told she would be contacted  over the telephone  after 
her visit so she could log her complaint. But she said when a staff member  phoned  her they 
told her they werent  able to discuss her complaint at that time and stated they would contact 
her the following day to do so. Ms F said this didnt happen. 
Ms F wasnt happy with this and, on 11 December 2018, she contacted  NatWest  again to 
complain. In her complaint, Ms F stated that she was unhappy that NatWest  had blocked her 
online transfer and asked her to attend  a branch after answering  identification questions over 
the telephone. She also complained that NatWest hadnt escalated her complaint properly. 
She felt, overall, she had received poor service. 
After NatWest investigated what had happened it told Ms F it didnt think  it had done 
anything wrong. It explained why Ms Fs payment had attracted a fraud alert and it said it 
didnt feel the service she received over the telephone was poor.  
Being dissatisfied with NatWests response  Ms F brought her complaint to us. Our 
adjudicator looked into it and thought NatWest had dealt with Ms Fs complaint fairly. They 
didnt think NatWest had done anything wrong. But Ms F didnt agree and asked for her 
complaint to be referred to an ombudsman
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Ms Fs complaint   either about the problems with the transfer 
or logging  her concerns as a formal  complaint. Strictly speaking,  we dont have the power to 
look at how financial businesses deal with complaint handling  as its not a regulated  
activity under the legislation  that governs our service. So, even if I did think  NatWest hadnt 
done things well in this regard, I wouldnt be able to uphold that element of her concerns or 
Ref: DRN19226402make an award. I cant act outside  the law. So, I wont spend any time in this decision on 
that. Ill deal solely with the problems  Ms F had making the transfer and getting her account  
unblocked.
Having carefully considered everything  Ms F and NatWest have said relating to this part of 
her complaint, Im not persuaded that NatWest made a mistake or done anything wrong 
when it subjected Ms Fs online transfer  to a fraud check. Ill explain why.
Banks have a duty to have robust strategies to safeguard customer accounts from potentially  
fraudulent transactions. Preventing fraud is as important for the bank as it is for its 
customers. To do so a bank may subject online payments to a security check.
I understand that when NatWest blocked Ms Fs online transfer it was an inconvenient  and 
frustrating experience  especially given that this transaction  was genuine. But, I think 
NatWest had reason  to suspect this transaction wasnt authentic and it couldnt  have known  
whether it was or wasnt until it could confirm the circumstances  of this transfer with Ms F.
Ms F said shes  transferred  money  on a number  of occasions without experiencing a 
problem. So, shes unhappy that this transfer  was blocked. But, while  Ms F may have made 
previous online transfers,  the issue here is her inability to make  this specific transfer  on 8 
December 2018.  
Ms F disputes that NatWest needed to subject this transfer to a security check  because she 
said this was an internal  transfer from her current account to her savings account.  She 
believes such transfers are exempt  from a fraud  check. But NatWest told our service that it 
experiences fraudsters everyday who transfer funds  internally  between customer accounts  
before later moving the money to their account.  It said this was a common  pattern and this is 
why internal transfers can prompt security checks.
 
This transfer  was for a large amount and, in view of the above, I can understand why 
NatWest had cause  to be vigilant here. I think it was reasonable for it to have processes in 
place to check online internal transfers  given the pattern  of fraud  it has experienced. This 
was just as much for Ms Fs protection as it was for NatWests. 
NatWest is entitled  to determine  its own policy in this regard. So, we cant comment  on 
whether a business policy is right or tell it that its policy should be changed. But in the 
individual circumstances  here, Im satisfied  NatWest followed its own policy  on security 
checks for online transfers. So, I cant fairly conclude it made an error  when  it subjected  the 
online transfer Ms F had wanted to make  to a security check.
After this payment  was blocked Ms F was asked to complete security during a telephone call 
with NatWest. Ms F has told our service that she believes the questions she was asked by 
NatWest during this call were not designed to prove  who she was. Rather, she feels  the 
questions were irrelevant  and intended  to trip her up. Having listened to the call in question I 
dont agree with what Ms F says here. And I believe  that the questions NatWest asked her 
were in efforts to ascertain whether  it was Ms F with whom it was speaking. 
NatWest has explained  that fraudsters will often pose as genuine customers  and that they 
can sometimes pass all of the security  questions theyre asked. It stated that, even where  a 
customer answers questions correctly, a member  of staff can ask them to attend a branch if 
they feel they may not be genuine or where they dont match  the customers  profile.
Ref: DRN19226403In this instance, NatWest  said it had concerns  over whether Ms F had proven her identity to 
it. It explained this was because she was unable  to correctly answer a number of specific  
and multiple choice questions it asked to confirm her identity. So, it said Ms Fs responses  to 
questions asked during that telephone  call attracted red flags. And NatWest  stated  that, in 
the interests of protecting the security of Ms Fs account, she was asked to attend a branch 
with proof  of identification.  
Im satisfied that asking  Ms F to attend  a branch was a reasonable precaution  for NatWest  to 
adopt here. But I can understand how this caused inconvenience and frustration to Ms F. I 
think, overall, it was reasonable for NatWest to respond in the way it did to ensure it was 
acting in Ms Fs best interests.   In doing so, I believe NatWest  was simply trying to safeguard  
Ms Fs account from potential  fraud. So, taking everything into consideration, I cant  fairly 
conclude that the way in which  it responded was unreasonable in the circumstances. 
I understand Ms F feels very strongly about the issues raised in this complaint. But, for the 
reasons set out above, I think that NatWest acted fairly and reasonably. So it follows  that Im 
not going to be asking  it to do anything.   
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 June  2019.
