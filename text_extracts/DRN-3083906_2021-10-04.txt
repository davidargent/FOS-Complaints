The complaint
Miss B is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, approved her for credit that wasnt
affordable for her at that time and later increased the limit on her credit account which also
wasnt affordable for her at that time.  
What happened
Miss B applied for a NewDay administered credit card account in November 2015. Miss Bs
application was approved, and she was issued with a credit card with an initial credit limit of
£250. Three month later, in February 2016, NewDay increased the credit limit on Miss Bs
account to £1,250. NewDay then increased the credit limit again, to £2,450, in September
2016. Miss B cleared the full outstanding balance and closed her account in March 2019.
In December 2019, Miss B applied for a second NewDay administered credit card account.
This application was also approved, and Miss B was issued with a new credit card with an
initial credit limit of £250. In April 2020, Miss B informed NewDay that she was experiencing
financial difficulties, and her account subsequently fell into arrears.
In February 2020, Miss B raised a complaint with NewDay on the basis that she felt that
NewDay approving her for credit, and later increasing her credit limit, had been unaffordable
for her at those times.
NewDay looked at Miss Bs complaint. But they noted that theyd conducted checks into
Miss Bs financial position before approving her for credit and before increasing the credit
limit on her account, and that there had been nothing resulting from these checks that they
felt should have given them cause to suspect that Miss B might not be able to afford the
credit being offered to her at those times. So, they didnt uphold Miss Bs complaint.
Miss B wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so she referred her complaint to this
service. One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that while NewDay didnt
act unreasonably in providing the initial credit account to Miss B in 2015, Miss Bs
circumstances  including that wasnt employed  meant that NewDay should have
undertaken more borrower focussed checks into Miss Bs financial position before
considering any credit limit increases on Miss Bs account. Additionally, our investigator felt
that had NewDay undertaken further checks, it should have been apparent to NewDay that
Miss B wouldnt be able to afford any credit limit increases at that time.
Our investigator also felt that this same rationale applied to NewDays approval of the
second credit card account, which our investigator felt also shouldnt have been approved by
NewDay. So, our investigator recommended that this complaint be upheld in Miss Bs favour
on that basis.
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 2 September 2021 as follows:
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how 
much and on what terms. What this service would expect would be that, before 
approving a customer for a new line of credit, or for a credit limit increase on an 
existing line of credit, that the business would undertake reasonable and 
proportionate borrower focussed checks to ensure that any credit being offered to a 
customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
NewDay say that that they did that here. When Miss C applied for credit in both 2015 
and 2019, they obtained information from Miss C about her income to confirm that 
she could afford to make any monthly account repayments that might become due. 
Additionally, NewDay also obtained information about Miss B from a credit reference 
agency in order to gain a better understanding of Miss Bs wider financial position, 
and NewDay state that there was nothing resulting from any of these checks that 
gave NewDay any reason to suspect that Miss B might not be able to afford the lines 
of credit she was applying for at those times.
Furthermore, NewDay also explain that before increasing the credit limit on Miss Bs
account, they reviewed how Miss B had managed her NewDay credit account up to 
that time to ensure that there were no indications that Miss B might be struggling 
financially. NewDay also obtained further information from a credit reference agency 
to update their understanding of Miss Bs wider financial position, and again NewDay 
contend that there was nothing resulting from these checks that should have made 
them consider that Miss B might not be able to afford the credit limit increases being 
provided to her.
I can appreciate NewDays position here, and while Im satisfied that the initial 
approval of Miss Bs account application in 2015 was reasonable  given the 
information provided to NewDay by Miss B at that time and the relatively low initial 
credit limit of £250 - Im not convinced that the checks that NewDay undertook into 
Miss Bs financial position at the time of the credit limit increases were reasonable or 
proportionate, or borrower focussed.
I say this because at the time of the account application Miss B had informed 
NewDay that she was a homemaker with an annual income of £17,000. In effect, this 
meant that Miss B was unemployed with a high likelihood that her annual income 
was received in the form of benefits  which Miss B herself has subsequently 
confirmed.
As such, while I consider it reasonable that NewDay would approve Miss B for a 
credit account with a low credit limit of £250, I struggle to understand why NewDay 
subsequently increased the credit limit on Miss Bs account to first £1,250, and then 
to £2,400  almost ten times the initial credit limit of £250  within ten months of Miss 
B opening the account.
My concerns here are only exacerbated by the fact that NewDay, despite being 
informed of Miss Bs status of a homemaker, didnt contact Miss B to ask her directly 
about her financial situation at that time  which would be expected by this service 
given that Miss B had made NewDay aware that she wasnt in full time employment.Its also notable that NewDay elected to increase the credit limit on Miss Bs account 
by a factor of five  from £250 to £1,250  after only three months of Miss B opening 
the account. Which again, given Miss Bs employment status, seems somewhat rash, 
and didnt, in my opinion, give due regard or care to Miss Bs stated circumstances at 
that time.
Furthermore, had NewDay contacted Miss B and confirmed with her that she 
remained unemployed, I can only conclude that the only reasonable decision that 
NewDay should have made was that it wouldnt be appropriate to increase the credit 
limit on Miss Bs account at that time, as this would risk drawing an unemployed 
customer into greater levels of debt.
For these reasons, I dont feel that NewDay should have offered either of the credit 
limit increases to Miss B that they did, and so I will be provisionally upholding this 
aspect of Miss Bs complaint.
Miss B repaid and closed her first NewDay account in March 2019, and in December 
2019 she applied for a second NewDay administered account. Our investigator felt, 
given that NewDay should have been more aware of Miss Bs earlier financial 
position, that they also shouldnt have approved this later credit account application.
I can appreciate our investigators position here, but Im satisfied that by clearing and 
closing the previous account, and given the length of time that had elapsed since 
then to when Miss B applied for the second credit account, that it was reasonable for 
NewDay to consider Miss Bs application from a clean slate perspective.
And, given that NewDay approved Miss Bs later application and issued her with a 
credit card with the same relatively low credit limit of £250 as had been issued on 
Miss Bs earlier account, I dont feel that it was unreasonable or unfair for NewDay to 
have done this.
It also must be noted that, while Miss B did confirm at the time of the second 
application that she was still a homemaker, she also confirmed that her annual 
income had risen from £17,000 to £24,000, which I feel further confirms that NewDay 
were justified in approving Miss B for that later credit account with the same credit 
limit as she was approved for in the first instance. As such, I will not be provisionally 
upholding this aspect of Miss Bs complaint.
All of which means that my provisional decision will be that I uphold this complaint 
against NewDay on the basis that I feel that it wasnt fair or reasonable for them to 
have increased the credit limit on Miss Bs first credit account beyond the initial credit 
limit of £250 at which the account was first approved.
My provisional instructions are therefore that NewDay must reimburse all interest, 
fee, and charges incurred or accrued on that account for any balance above £250 
from the point of the first credit limit increase onwards.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance in Miss Bs favour, NewDay must 
pay that credit balance to Miss B along with 8% simple interest.
NewDay must also remove any adverse credit reporting from Miss Bs credit file in 
relation to this account from the time of the first credit limit increase onwards.In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Miss B and NewDay the opportunity to provide 
any comments or further information they might wish me to consider before I moved to a 
final decision.
Miss B confirmed that she was happy to accept the provisional decision and had no further 
comments to make. However, NewDay did provide some further comments, essentially 
reiterating their position as to why they felt that the credit limit increases that theyd 
implemented on the first account shouldnt be considered as being unfair or unreasonable.
I can appreciate NewDays position here, but they havent provided any new information that 
I havent already considered when arriving at my provisional decision. Furthermore, it 
remains my position that NewDays increasing the credit limit on Miss Bs first account from 
£250 to £1,250 and then to £2,400  increases which I do consider to be significant - without 
first contacting Miss B to discuss these potential increases with her, at times when NewDay 
had been made aware that Miss B wasnt in employment, arent indicative of the kind of 
borrower focussed checks that this service would expect here.
As such, I see no reason not to issue my final decision on the same basis as that outlined in 
my provisional decision, and I can confirm that my final decision will be that I uphold this 
complaint against NewDay on that basis.
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse all interest, fees, and charges incurred or accrued on Miss Bs first 
NewDay account for any balance above £250 from the point of the first credit limit increase 
onwards.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance in Miss Bs favour, NewDay must pay that 
credit balance to Miss B along with 8% simple interest calculated until the date of the 
payment by NewDay to Miss B.
NewDay must also remove any adverse credit reporting from Miss Bs credit file in relation to 
the first account from the time of the first credit limit increase onwards.
  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, on the 
basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 November 2021.
