The complaint
Mr O complains that he was disadvantaged when Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited (Aviva) 
backdated his pension transfer to when they received it. 
What happened
Mr O decided to transfer a pension plan held with another provider to his Aviva pension plan. 
He intended to take 25% of the transferred funds as tax-free cash. He told Aviva that he 
wanted to do this as soon as theyd received the funds.
Aviva received the transfer on 20 February 2020. It had a value of £200,663.92 at that time. 
But the transferring company didnt use the specific reference Aviva needed. So they werent 
able to identify who the payment belonged to. 
On 3 March 2020 Mr O called Aviva to chase the transfer. At this point Aviva were able to 
match the transfer theyd received to Mr O. The following day they processed the transfer. 
They followed their policy to backdate the purchase of units in Mr Os chosen investment 
funds to the date they received the transfer. 
Aviva spoke to Mr O to tell him he could now take his tax-free cash. He was unhappy as the 
transferred funds were now worth £187,812.43, around £13,000 less than the amount Aviva 
had received. Mr O took tax-free cash of £46,953.11. 
Mr O complained to Aviva about the fall in value of his transfer. He said that he wouldve 
been able to take more tax-free cash if theyd processed his request using the value of the 
funds theyd received.
Aviva upheld his complaint. They agreed they couldve processed his tax-free cash payment 
more quickly. They confirmed that the earliest date they shouldve contacted him to arrange 
his tax-free cash was 24 February 2020. This was the date Aviva had received confirmation 
about the transfer from the transferring company. To correct the tax-free cash payment, 
Aviva used the fund value on the 24 February 2020. This was £199,665.81. They worked out 
that the total tax-free cash Mr O shouldve received was 25% of this amount, or £49,916.45. 
So they offered to pay Mr O an additional £2,963.34. They adjusted this slightly for interest. 
And also offered Mr O £100 for the trouble and upset theyd put him through.
Aviva also told Mr O that theyd check if they needed to buy additional units on his behalf to 
correct the remaining funds in his drawdown account. After their actuarial team had reviewed 
the complaint, Aviva confirmed that Mr Os drawdown account did in fact already hold the 
correct number of units. Aviva showed their calculations to Mr O.
But Mr O was unhappy with their response. So he brought his complaint to this service. He 
felt that Aviva shouldve based both his tax-free cash and his drawdown units on the initial 
transfer value of £200,663.92. 
Our investigator didnt think Aviva needed to do anything more. He felt that Aviva had put Mr 
O back into the position he shouldve been in. 
Mr O didnt agree. He said his complaint was that when Aviva applied the transferred funds 
to his account, they immediately reduced the value. While he acknowledged that Aviva had 
applied their policy in backdating the purchase of units to the date they received the transfer, 
he felt hed been disadvantaged. So his complaint has come to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not going to uphold this compliant. I appreciate this will be disappointing 
to Mr O. But Ill explain why Ive reached this decision.
Aviva have a policy of backdating transfers to the date they first received the funds. They 
said: When a transfer payment is applied our procedure is to always backdate the effective 
date of this to the date it was received. Therefore, the transfer for your plan was applied with 
effect from 20 February 2020. Mr O said that this policy has disadvantaged him. So I need 
to decide if the policy is fair. 
If Aviva didnt have this policy, their customers would take on market risk during the transfer 
process. Transfers and re-investment do take time. And customers have the right to expect 
not to lose out just because theyve decided to transfer to a different provider. Avivas policy 
means that they invest the transferred funds according to their customers choices on the 
day they receive the money. In Mr Os case, the application of this policy meant that the 
£200,663.92 received on 20 February 2020 was used to buy the number of units it wouldve 
bought on that day. Effectively Avivas policy means that customers are never out of the 
market. So Im satisfied that the policy is fair.
I also need to consider if Aviva applied their policy correctly. I note that the transfer was 
received on 20 February 2020. But I can see that the transferring provider first confirmed 
that the transfer had been paid on 24 February 2020. At this point Aviva didnt know who the 
transferred funds belonged to, as the transferring provider hadnt used the correct payment 
reference. But on 3 March 2020, Aviva were able to match the transfer to Mr O. 
I consider that if the transferring provider had used the correct payment reference, the 
transfer wouldve been processed when itd been received. This was 20 February 2020. 
I acknowledge that if Aviva had used the unit prices from the date they processed the 
transfer  4 March 2020  then Mr O wouldve received more units. This is because unit 
prices fell between 20 February 2020 and 4 March 2020. But Mr O has himself said that he 
wouldnt have complained had the move in markets gone in his favour.
In using 20 February 2020 as the effective investment date, Aviva have put Mr O in the 
position he wouldve been in had everything in the entire process worked as it should have. 
So I consider that they used their policy correctly in this case.
Tax-free cash 
Mr O had made it clear to Aviva that he wanted to take tax-free cash as soon as theyd 
received the transferred funds. 
When trying to put things right for Mr O, Aviva noted that they shouldve contacted him when 
they received the transfer confirmation letter from his previous provider. They said that if 
theyd done this, his tax-free cash couldve been paid with effect from 24 February 2020.Looking at the sequence of events, I agree that this is the earliest date Aviva could 
reasonably have arranged the tax-free cash payment. So Im satisfied that this is a 
reasonable date to use.
Aviva said that the value of the fund on 24 February 2020 was £199,665.81. So the 
maximum tax-free cash Mr O couldve taken was £49,916.45. Hed actually taken tax-free 
cash of £46,953.11, based on the 4 March 2020 fund value of £187,812.43. So, to put Mr O 
back to the position he shouldve been in if hed been able to take his tax-free cash on 24 
February 2020, Aviva arranged to pay him an additional £2,963.34. This meant hed now 
received the full tax-free cash he wouldve received if hed taken it on the earliest possible 
date. Aviva also added interest to the additional payment. 
Aviva noted that theyd caused Mr O some trouble and upset, so they gave him £100 
compensation. 
In their 27 April 2020 letter Aviva told Mr O: Had the TFC been paid with effect from 24 
February 2020, the remaining amount moved to drawdown would have been £149,749.358. 
This is a difference of £8,890.04 (£149,749.35 - £140,859.32).
Therefore, Ive contacted our actuarial department and asked them to calculate what your 
current unit holding, and fund value would have been, had £149,749.358 been moved to 
drawdown with effect from 24 February 2020. I can then arrange for any additional units 
required to be added to your plan.
So understandably Mr O still felt that hed lost out. Aviva had given him reason to think hed 
be getting some units added to his drawdown fund. 
But that wasnt correct. Aviva didnt owe Mr O any extra units in his drawdown fund. They 
wrote to him again on 15 May 2020 to explain why. Theyd correctly allocated 75% of the 
transferred amount on 20 February 2020, following their usual policy. This was worth 
£149,749.35 on 20 February 2020 and £140,863.52 on 5 March 2020. But Mr O had the 
correct number of units in his drawdown fund throughout. 
Avivas policy ensured that Mr O was invested in his chosen assets from 20 February 2020. 
Unfortunately for Mr O, unit prices fell between then and 4 March 2020. But he was correctly 
invested throughout that period.
From everything Ive seen, Aviva have put Mr O back to the position he shouldve been in if 
hed actually been able to take his tax-free cash on 24 February 2020. And theyve shown 
why they dont need to do anything to correct the number of units in his drawdown fund. 
I appreciate that a couple of sentences (copied above) in Avivas letter of 27 April 2020 were 
unhelpful. But I consider that Aviva took reasonable steps to provide further explanation as 
to why Mr O already held the correct number of units in his drawdown fund.
Under the circumstances of this complaint, Im satisfied that given the additional tax-free 
cash payment Aviva have made to Mr O, theyve returned him to the position he shouldve 
been in had his transfer gone ahead normally. I acknowledge that Mr O feels Aviva also owe 
him additional units in his drawdown fund. But Im not persuaded that they do. From what 
Ive seen, Mr Os drawdown fund contains the number of units it should. So Im not going to 
ask Aviva to do anything more. 
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 August 2021.
