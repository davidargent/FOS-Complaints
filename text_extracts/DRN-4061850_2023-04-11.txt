The complaint
Miss W complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) declined a loan 
application. She would like it to agree a loan, and to refund hotel costs she says she incurred 
whilst going through the loan application process.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
NatWest has explained that it declined loan applications submitted by Miss W on 29 
September 2022 as they didnt meet its required lending criteria based on the 
information Miss W provided, and on her credit score. That might not have been 
made clear during the online application process, but this was explained to Miss W in 
NatWests final response letter (frl)
I also understand the applications didnt reach the point whereby these decisions 
could be overturned. I think this explains why they werent referred to the 
underwriters or appeals teams. Its clear from the frl that NatWest issued that it 
looked to see if it could overturn these decisions but was unable to do so
I appreciate Miss W had a previous loan agreed in 2021 but that doesnt 
automatically mean further loans would be approved. Neither does it necessarily 
mean that NatWests lending criteria has changed. Or that if it had, it would be under 
an obligation to advise Miss W of this. As Miss W didnt meet NatWests lending 
criteria I cant say it was unreasonable in turning down her loan applications. So, I 
cant reasonably ask NatWest to agree a loan with Miss W or to reimburse any costs 
she says she incurred whilst going through the loans application process.
I understand Miss W applied for a loan of a lower amount to test the system. This 
loan was approved but she says NatWest didnt cancel it as requested. Looking at 
the customer notes the loan was cancelled on 2 December 2022 the day after she 
applied for it. But as I understand it  Miss W hadnt appreciated she would need to 
repay the full balance within 30 days. NatWest offered in principle to rebuild the loan, 
and credited Miss Ws account with Â£300 for the distress and inconvenience caused 
by cancelling the loan. It also asked the Credit Reference Agencies(CRAs) to 
remove any adverse data reported on this loan in December 2022 and January 2023. 
I cant find fault with NatWests actions here.
Miss W has raised some other issues with us. Firstly, the fact that NatWest no longer 
offers the option online for alternative loan amounts to be offered when applying for 
loans. Thats a business decision for NatWest and not for us to comment  on.
Secondly, I understand Miss W is not happy that NatWest declined a mortgage 
application. As this didnt form part of her original complaint we havent investigated 
this or given NatWest the option to comment. If Miss W feels she hasnt been fairly  
treated she will need to raise this with NatWest. If she isnt happy with its response 
she can consider putting in a new complaint to us.
I do appreciate the difficult financial and personal situation Miss W has shared with 
us. But ultimately its a business decision for NatWest as to who it lends to. And as 
Miss W didnt meet its lending criteria for the larger loans I cant say it did anything 
wrong in not agreeing to those loans.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 May 2023.
