The complaint
Ms P complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc didnt do enough to prevent her losing money to a 
scam.
Ms P has used a representative to bring her complaint, but for ease of reading, Ill mostly just 
refer to Ms P herself.
What happened
The detailed background to this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide 
a brief overview of some of the key events here. 
In December 2020 Ms P reported to HSBC that shed made a series of payments as the 
result of a scam. HSBC advised her at the time that as the payments had been made to an 
account in her own name, they couldnt help. They referred her on to the other business she 
had an account with (which I understand to be a cryptocurrency provider C). 
On 1 February 2023 Ms Ps representative wrote to HSBC requesting reimbursement for 26 
payments made between August and December 2020 which she said were as the result of a 
romance / investment scam. They said Ms P had met someone online who had later tricked 
her into making payments to a fake investment. HSBC responded and said they wouldnt 
treat this as a case of authorised push payment fraud as Ms P had transferred the money to 
an account in her own name and provided referral rights to our service.
On 14 March 2023 Ms Ps representative wrote again to HSBC and clarified that the claim 
was actually in relation to a loss of £46,850.93 which arose from 19 payments made 
between August and November 2020. HSBC reiterated their position from their previous 
response. 
The matter was referred to our service and one of our Investigators didnt recommend it 
should be upheld. In summary he wasnt persuaded all the payments Ms P had mentioned 
were made as the result of a scam, and for those that were, he didnt think there was a 
reasonable basis upon which to ask HSBC to provide any redress. Ms P didnt accept this 
outcome and asked for an Ombudsman to review her complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as our Investigator and for similar reasons. 
I know this will be disappointing for Ms P, so Ill explain why. 
Which, if any, of Ms Ps payments were made as the result of a scam?
The circumstances of the scam that Ms P has described are that she met an individual on a 
dating website. Over a period of weeks they formed a friendship and ultimately he tricked her 
into making payments towards a scam investment which involved him pretending that he 
worked for a genuine business. 
Ms P initially alleged that the scam payments took place between 2 August and 15 
December 2020. She is now alleging that 19 payments made between 2 August and 23 
November 2020 were made as the result of a scam  she says the payments after that date 
were her doing further investments to try to make her money back. Ms P has also provided 
evidence of the text messages between her and the scammer. 
As there is conflicting information here (and I accept Ms Ps memory may have faded with 
time) I must first make a finding as to which payments were part of the scam, and which 
were Ms P investing in her own right. 
Ms Ps bank statements show that she had been making payments to C as far back as 
October 2019. And whilst Ms P isnt seeking reimbursement for payments from that time, it 
does indicate that she was already investing in cryptocurrency, before the involvement of the 
scammer. And the first time the scammer persuades her into making a payment appears to 
be on 22 October 2020 when the following exchange takes place:
Scammer: One can become a referral with as low and £1000 which is about
0.1 btc.
Ms P: Count me in then, Fed up with [C]  I did not make anything with them sold low 
bought high.
Scammer: Lol, great.
Ms P then goes on to make a £1,000 payment from her HSBC account to C on 23 October 
2020. On balance, I think this is the first payment she made towards the scam. Im not 
persuaded any of the previous payments can fairly be said to have been made as a result of 
the scam. I find the message history to be persuasive evidence of this. 
Ms Ps most recent submissions also only referred to payments up until 23 November 2020. 
But the message history between her and the scammer indicates this wasnt the case. One 
strong example of this is on 30 November 2020 when Ms P said to the scammer: send me 
the wallet address for today and I will make the remaining transfer when I get home. Whilst 
this could have been with reference to funds already credited to C, I think it shows that the 
scam was ongoing at that point. And on balance, I think its likely the payments at that time 
from HSBC to C were also part of the scam. 
The first evidence I have that Ms P was certain shed been the victim of a scam, is an email 
she has shared of her reporting this to the dating website on 11 December 2020. I think its 
implausible that Miss P would have continued to make payments towards the scam, once 
she had discovered it. So I dont think any payments after that date were as a result of the 
scam. 
Overall, on balance, I think this leaves the following payments (from 23 October until 8 
December) as those that were made as a result of the scam. If a payment was made to C 
and returned the same day it has been considered as part of the account activity, but Ive 
excluded it from the table. Further to this, Im aware that following the discovery of the scam, 
there was a transfer from C back to Ms Ps HSBC account on 20 December 2020 for over 
£11,400. Were I upholding this complaint, Id need to consider whether that payment 
included any of the funds Ms P had sent during the scam  but as Im not requiring HSBC to 
pay anything, I dont need to establish this.  Date Event Beneficiary / Payer

Were the scam payments so unusual that HSBC ought to have done more before 
processing them?
Ms Ps previous account history includes payments going back to 2019 towards 
cryptocurrency (and specifically the same payee, C). These include but arent limited to:
five payments on one day in October 2019 to C which together totalled £9,000.
two payments for £3,000 each on consecutive days in January 2020.
a payment for over £10,000 in March 2020.
a payment for £6,700 in May 2020.
a payment to C for £10,000 in August 2020.
payments for £6,800 and £5,000 (both to C) on consecutive days in September 2020. 
And it is in the context of the above payments (and others like them) that I dont think any of 
the payments towards the scam would have stood out as so unusual, suspicious or 
potentially indicative of fraud such that HSBC ought to have done more at the time. The 
scam payments were a continuation of the established way in which Ms P used her account. 
So I cant say that HSBC acted unfairly when following Ms Ps instructions and processing 
the payments without taking any additional steps. 
However, for the one payment listed above on 8 December 2020 and which went to L, there 
is evidence that HSBC did intervene in that payment. There was a call between Ms P and 
HSBC which Ive listened to. On the call the HSBC agent asked some questions and 
provided some generic warnings about scams. 
I have to keep in mind that the payment being questioned was for £1,000 and wasnt 
something that I would have necessarily expected HSBC to have intervened in. And the 
main purpose of the call seemed to be to check that it was authorised by Ms P, and the call 
achieved this. But once there is interaction, Id expect HSBC to take advantage of that 
opportunity to speak with their customer. I think the adviser could and should have gone 
further in the questions asked and warnings provided. But overall, this doesnt change my 
mind as to the outcome of this complaint. 
This is because even if HSBC had gone further, Im not persuaded this would have made a 
difference. I say this because within the chat history there is evidence that on 13 November 2020 Ms P shared a link with the scammer which included details about online romance 
scams. The following exchange then took place:
Ms P: (in reference to the link) Gosh you are ticking all the boxes.
Scammer: Its sad thats what you think about me. I love you and one thing I cant stoop so 
low to do is to be dishonest about my personality.
Ms P: I do not think thats my problem.
I think the above exchange makes clear that Ms P was fully aware of the possibility of her 
friend being a scammer. The scammer managed to talk her round and persuaded her to 
continue making payments. But as she was already well aware of the risk of this type of 
scam, Im not persuaded that any reasonable level of intervention by HSBC would have 
made a difference to Ms P instructing the payment. And I dont think this is a case where 
HSBC should have refused her instruction altogether. 
So overall, Im not persuaded that HSBC ought to have done more before processing the 
payments to C (which was already an established payee) or the £300 payment to L. And Im 
not persuaded that any reasonable level of interaction in relation to their call about the 
£1,000 payment to L would have made a difference to Ms P going ahead. 
Recovery.
I dont think HSBC should have done more when Ms P reported the scam with regard to 
recovery efforts. As Ms P was in control of the account with C, had anything remained, she 
could have obtained this herself. And I can see from the evidence provided that she did 
attempt such a recovery, sadly without success. 
Summary
Ms Ps complaint form to our service also mentioned that she would like HSBC to pay her 
£500 compensation and to cover any legal fees shes incurred. As I dont think HSBC fairly 
and reasonably caused Ms Ps loss or that theyve provided poor service, there isnt a 
reasonable basis upon which I can require them to provide redress or compensation. 
The choice to use a representative to bring her complaint was Ms Ps. And if she has 
incurred costs in doing so, that isnt something that I think HSBC are responsible for. 
Im sorry to hear Ms P lost so much money to a scam, particular one of this nature where its 
clear her emotions were preyed upon. But my role requires that I remain impartial, despite 
my natural sympathy. And for the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding this complaint.
 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 November 2023.
