Complaint
Mr A has complained that Advancis Limited (trading as Buddy Loans) provided him with an 
unaffordable guarantor loan. He says the information on his credit file ought to have shown 
Buddy Loans that he was already in financial difficulty.  
  
Background
Buddy Loans provided Mr A with a loan of £7,500.00 in August 2015. This loan had an APR 
of 49.9% and a 60-month term. This all meant the total amount repayable of £17,793.55 was 
due to be repaid in 60 monthly instalments of approaching £300.
One of our adjudicators looked at this complaint and thought that Buddy Loans had unfairly 
provided Mr A with this loan. So she recommended the complaint be upheld. Buddy Loans 
disagreed with our adjudicator and asked for an ombudsman to review the complaint.
  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.

reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending -
including the key rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. And Ive
referred to this when deciding Mr As complaint.
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr As complaint. These two
questions are:
1. Did Buddy Loans complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself
that Mr A would be able to repay his loan in a sustainable way?
o If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
o If not, would those checks have shown that Mr A wouldve been able to do 
so?
2. Did Buddy Loans act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Did Buddy Loans complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that
Mr A would be able to repay his loan in a sustainable way?
Buddy Loans provided this loan while it was authorised and regulated by the Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA). The rules and regulations in place required Buddy Loans to
carry out a reasonable and proportionate assessment of Mr As ability to make the
repayments under this agreement. This assessment is sometimes referred to as an
affordability assessment or affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower focused  so Buddy Loans had to think about whether
repaying the loan would cause significant adverse consequences for Mr A. In practice this
meant that Buddy Loans had to ensure that making the payments to the loan wouldnt
cause Mr A undue difficulty or adverse consequences.
In other words, it wasnt enough for Buddy Loans to simply think about the likelihood of
it getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr A. The 
existence of a guarantee and the potential for Buddy Loans to pursue the guarantor instead 
of Mr A, for the loan payments doesnt alter, lessen, or somehow dilute this obligation.
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application. 
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount / type / cost of credit they are seeking.
Even for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different
applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the longer the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit is
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make payments for an extended 
period); and
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed a proportionate check
shouldve been for a given loan application  including (but not limited to) any indications of
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in future circumstances.
Ive carefully thought about all of the relevant factors in this case.
Were Buddy Loans checks reasonable and proportionate?
Buddy Loans says that it carried out an income and expenditure assessment with Mr A prior 
to providing him with his loan. It also carried out a credit check. Mr A confirmed that he was 
earning around £1,540.00 a month, had expenses of £886 and would have to make 
payments of £520.44 to creditors each month once this loan was approved. 
The credit check Buddy Loans carried out showed that Mr A had two relatively recent 
defaulted accounts, three more credit cards with balances close to the credit limit and had 17 
separate searches carried out on him by credit providers in the months leading up to this application. Buddy Loans says Mr A had enough left to make the required monthly loan 
payments, when the living costs and the monthly payments left needed to meet the credit 
commitments shown on the credit check were deducted from Mr As monthly income. 
 
Ive carefully thought about what Buddy Loans has said. But simply requesting information 
from a borrower doesnt, on its own, mean that a lender will have carried out a borrower 
focused assessment of the borrowers ability to sustainably repay a loan. 
The credit check Buddy Loans carried out indicated that Mr A had significant difficulties with 
credit in the past, other accounts which were showing signs of potential difficulty and that 
hed made a significant number of other applications for credit in the months leading up to 
this application. Ive seen that Buddy Loans has said as a sub-prime lender it expects its 
customers to have credit commitments that have at some stage fell behind. Be that as it 
may, bearing in mind the regulatory rules place an obligation to carry out a borrower focused 
check, where previous repayment difficulties are apparent, I would expect a lender to take 
additional steps to verify that a consumer can take on an additional commitment before 
providing it.  
In this case Buddy Loans appears to have simply accepted Mr As explanation that his 
defaulted accounts were in dispute and proceeded to exclude them from consideration. Im 
also concerned about the low monthly payments attributed to Mr As other credit cards too. 
These payments were simply not enough to ensure that the balance would be repaid within 
a reasonable period of time. 
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that Buddy Loans needed to take steps to verify Mr As 
income and expenditure instead of choosing to rely on an over optimistic calculation of his 
monthly disposable income based on data, his income and less than sustainable 
repayments to existing credit. As I cant see that this Buddy Loans did do this, or in fact take 
any steps at all to address the inconsistencies, I dont think that the checks it carried out 
before providing Mr A with his loan were reasonable and proportionate.
Would reasonable and proportionate checks have indicated to Buddy Loans that Mr A
would have been unable to repay this loan?
As reasonable and proportionate checks werent carried out before this loan was provided, 
I cant say for sure what they wouldve shown. So I need to decide whether it is more likely 
than not that a proportionate check would have told Buddy Loans that Mr A wouldve been 
unable to sustainably repay this loan.
Mr A has now provided us with evidence of his financial circumstances at the time he applied 
for this loan. Of course, I accept different checks might show different things. And just 
because something shows up in the information Mr A has provided, it doesnt mean it 
wouldve shown up in any checks Buddy Loans mightve carried out.
But in the absence of anything else from Buddy Loans showing what this information would 
have shown, I think its perfectly fair, reasonable and proportionate to place considerable 
weight on it as an indication of what Mr As financial circumstances were more likely than not 
to have been at the time.
As Ive already explained, Buddy Loans was required to establish whether Mr A could 
sustainably make his loan repayments  not just whether the loan payments were technically 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation, or simply proceed on the basis that it, in 
any event, had a second bite of the cherry in terms of being able to recover payments from 
the guarantor.Of course the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence basis might be 
an indication that a consumer could sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow that this is the case. And as a borrower shouldnt have to borrow further 
in order to make their payments, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to sustainably make their repayments if 
it is on notice that they are unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further.
Ive carefully considered the information Mr A has provided in light of all of this.
The information provided shows that Mr A was already struggling to manage the credit 
commitments he already had. His monthly expenditure exceeded his income and he was 
using credit in an attempt to make ends meet. In my view, this clearly demonstrates that    
Mr A was in no position to have been able to make the repayments to this loan without 
borrowing further or experiencing significant adverse consequences.
Bearing all of this in mind, Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would 
more likely than not have demonstrated that Mr A would not have been able to make the 
repayments to this loan. 
Did Buddy Loans act unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr A in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about everything provided. Having done so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude Buddy Loans acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr A in 
some other way.  
So I find that Buddy Loans didnt act unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr A in some other 
way.  
Did Mr A lose out as a result of Buddy Loans unfairly providing him with this loan?
As Mr A has paid or is being expected to pay interest and charges on a loan that he
shouldnt have been provided with, Im satisfied that he has lost out as a result of what
Buddy Loans did wrong.
So I think that Buddy Loans needs to put things right.  
Fair compensation - what Buddy Loans needs to do to put things right for Mr A
Having thought about everything, I think its fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of 
Mr As complaint for Buddy Loans to put things right by:
refunding all the interest, fees and charges Mr A paid on this loan;
adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded payments from the date
they were made by Mr A to the date of settlement;
removing any adverse information regarding this loan from Mr As credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Buddy Loans to take off tax from this interest. Buddy 
Loans must give Mr A a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks for one.
  
My final decisionFor the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr As complaint. Advancis Limited needs to 
put things right in the way set out above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2021.
