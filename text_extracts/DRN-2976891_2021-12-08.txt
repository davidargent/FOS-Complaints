The complaint
The estate of Mr P complains that Allay Claims Limited are asking for their success fees for 
payment protection insurance (PPI) claims made in the late Mr Ps  name.
Ms S has brought the complaint on behalf of Mr Ps estate.
  
What happened
Ms S said shed made PPI claims with Allay for herself. And when they found PPI shed 
been willing to pay their fee until she was alerted by a lender Ill call B, who said the claims 
were for her husband, whod died in 2016. Ms S said she never signed any claims on behalf 
of her husband. She complained to Allay.
Allay said they received an enquiry about a PPI claim in February 2019, and were provided 
with Mr Ps full address, previous address, telephone number, DOB and a list of lenders to 
claim back PPI from. At this time, no Letter of Authority (LoA) was signed, so no further 
action was taken to contact Mr Ps lenders. But in May 2019 an application was made for 
their services for 11 lenders. And later in August 2019 a further application was made for 
other lenders including B. And theyd acted in good faith in submitting these to Mr Ps 
lenders, pursuing his mis-sold PPI claims based on the information provided to them in the 
initial application.
One of the lenders Ill call H said the LoA was invalid. They didnt say why the LoA wasnt 
valid so Allay asked Mr P to complete another one. The LoA was sent by Allay via the post 
but it wasnt returned to them. With the approach of the August 2019 deadline for making 
such claims, Allay said they reached out to make sure the opportunity to claim wasnt 
missed. They sent a message to the mobile telephone number that was provided in 
February 2019. And a LoA was submitted to them with the addition of another couple of 
lenders, including B.
Allay said theyd provided updates about the claims when PPI had been found, and theyd 
provided their claims service. Allay said Ms S told them her husband had passed, and that 
she was happy to continue with the claims. She completed the PPI questionnaire (PPIQ) 
theyd asked her to complete to strengthen Mr Ps claim that the PPI had been mis-sold. 
Allay said B told them when Mr Ps claims were successful, and Ms S had agreed to pay 
their fees.  But later she denied signing the LoAs.
They said their fee was justified as theyd acted in good faith in submitting the LoA to Mr Ps 
lenders and Ms S had acted for his estate pursuing his PPI claims based on the information 
shed provided to Allay in the initial application.
Ms S wasnt happy with Allays response and referred the complaint on behalf of Mr Ps 
estate to us.
Our investigator said that Allay hadnt been authorised to act on behalf of Mr P and so they 
couldnt charge their fee.
Allay didnt agree, they said by Ms S getting the notification of Mr Ps successful claim it 
suggested shed submitted the claim for him.  And as the claim was successful Ms S, as the 
beneficiary, should pay their fee. They asked for an ombudsman to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im upholding this complaint. Ill explain why.
Ive seen a copy of the LoA completed and signed in May and August 2019. Each LoA is in 
the name of the late Mr P. The applicants details were pre-printed on the LoA by Allay and 
to be submitted a digital signature was added to it. But it doesnt mention that Mr P was 
deceased. Nor does it mention anyone acting as an executor for him. I can also see for the 
LoA signed in August 2019, that the initial given in the signature isnt the initial of Mr Ps first 
name. I think Allay could have questioned the signature, given the initial was different but 
they submitted the claims to Mr Ps lenders. And the LoA was initially accepted by some of 
Mr Ps lenders so Allay wouldnt have known Mr P had died.
But as Mr P died in 2016, for a PPI claim to have been made in May and August 2019, it 
would have had to have been made on behalf of the estate of Mr P. For Allay to have been 
authorised to pursue a PPI claim for Mr P they would have needed a LoA that correctly 
reflected the claim being made. The LoA would have needed to have shown both, Mr Ps 
name and that of the person acting for the estate, in this case Ms S, as she has grant of 
probate.  And lender H I think recognised this which is why they said the LoA sent to them 
was invalid, as it couldnt have been signed by Mr P.
When making the online application, the applicant in signing the LoA is agreeing to Allays 
terms and conditions. But as I outlined above the only applicant named on the  LoA is Mr P, 
and it wasnt possible for him to agree to Allays terms and conditions or to sign the LoA. 
When Allay was made aware that Mr P had died, I would have expected them to send 
another LoA to Ms S for her, if she accepted the terms and conditions, to sign. And by doing 
so Ms S would have authorised Allay to act on behalf of the estate of Mr P. I can see Allay 
sent another LoA that Ms S signed for lender L, but I cant see they took the same action 
for lender B.
Allay and Ms S spoke several times over the phone and Ms S said a number of times she 
would pay Allays fee. She also made it clear that her husband had passed. Ive listened to 
the calls and at the time Ms S completed the PPIQ, I think its clear Ms S knew the claim was 
for her husband as she said she was his next of kin. And would arrange for the grant of 
probate to be sent to Allay. But at no point in the call was Ms S told by Allay shed have to 
sign a LoA to authorise them to act on behalf of the estate for the claim to continue. 
For lender B there were three successful claims. A****674, A****675 and A****688. For 
A****675 and A****688 the redress was made to Mr P. But Allay said the redress paid for 
mis-sold PPI for a mortgage claim, reference A****674 has been made in Ms S name and 
therefore their fee for this claim is justified. But I can see in August 2020, B asked for 
further information about this claim addressed to Mr P. In November 2020, B told Allay that 
their authority to act on behalf of Mr P was no longer valid. So, by the time the redress letter 
was sent by B in December 2020, I think theyd accepted that Ms S was acting on behalf of 
the estate and had made out the redress in her name.as shed grant of probate. Ms S said 
shed been alerted by her lender that Allay didnt have authority to pursue claims on behalf of 
her husband. And I think from the timeline of events  B had recognised the LoA couldnt have been signed by Mr P, and that Allay didnt have a valid LoA from Mr P or an LoA 
signed on behalf of his estate.
As Allay didnt have a LoA signed on behalf of the estate of Mr P for his mis-sold PPI claims 
with B their terms and conditions hadnt  been agreed to. So, I dont think Allay were 
authorised to act for Mr P to pursue a PPI claim, and so they cant charge their success fee 
for his claims.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. And ask Allay Claims Limited to waive their fees for successful mis-
sold PPI claims with lender B. 
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S and the 
estate of Mr P to accept or reject my decision before 5 January 2022.
