The complaint
Mr S complains that PrePay Technologies Limited blocked his account and didnt give him 
access to the remaining funds when the account closed.
What happened
Mr S had an account with one of PrePays agents. To keep things simple Ill refer to PrePay 
in this decision. In December 2020, PrePay asked Mr S to provide information about funds 
paid into the account  and Mr S replied the same day. Mr S contacted PrePay for updates, 
but was told he needed to wait to hear from the compliance team.
Dissatisfied, Mr S referred his complaint to us.
PrePay completed the review and decided to close Mr Ss account. It offered to pay Mr S 
£100 for the inconvenience caused by the delay in its investigation, and asked Mr S to 
provide account details to return the remaining funds. But Monese said it in fact sent 
£995.50 back to the remitter of the funds  and sent just £5.69 to Mr Ss other account.
I looked at this, and didnt think PrePay had shown it had cause to return the funds to the 
remitter. But in response PrePay sent me additional information which led me to ask Mr S for 
further details about the funds paid into the account. I then issued provisional findings on 31 
March 2023, in which I concluded that PrePay had paid fair compensation for what had 
happened and that it didnt need to do anything further.
Mr S disagrees. He says these funds are his hard earned money, and that hes sure that 
PrePay should be able to get the funds back from the remitter and pay them to him. PrePay 
hasnt sent me anything further to consider.
Ive therefore considered the complaint afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Financial businesses, like PrePay, are subject to a number of legal and regulatory 
requirements. These require them to monitor their customers transactions and may mean 
they need to review an account at any time. Where it does this it doesnt need to give 
reasons. Based on what Ive seen, Im satisfied PrePay was acting in line with its legal and 
regulatory obligations when it blocked the account. Im also satisfied this is something tit was 
able to do under the terms and conditions that applied to Mr Ss account.
Id expect PrePay to complete any investigation in a timely manner. Although PrePay 
blocked the account in December 2020, it doesnt appear to have completed the review until 
April 2021. And it didnt return the remaining funds to Mr S and the remitter until December 
2021. PrePay says this was the result of internal backlogs. Im satisfied much of this delay 
was avoidable.
Finally, I considered PrePays decision to return most of the funds to the remitter. The terms 
and conditions allow PrePay to return funds to the sender in certain circumstances. But Id 
only expect PrePay to do this where it was satisfied Mr S wasnt entitled to them.
PrePay doesnt appear to have asked Mr S anything about this specific transaction at the 
time. So initially I didnt think PrePay had shown cause to return these funds. But PrePay 
has sent us additional information in response to my initial findings, which led me to ask Mr 
S for further details of this payment.
Mr S says that the payment related to a cash in hand job  he was working a trial period in 
household insulation. But he hasnt been able to provide any paperwork or payslips relating 
to this job. Nor was he able to provide this in response to my provisional decision. Mr S says 
that had PrePay asked for this sooner, he might have been able to provide this. But while 
Ive carefully considered what Mr S has said about this, Im not persuaded Mr S would have 
been able to provide satisfactory evidence of his entitlement to the funds. Given that he cant 
now provide documentary evidence, and given the concerns PrePay have now told us about, 
I dont accept that PrePay acted unfairly in returning the funds to sending account.
Ive therefore considered what PrePay needs to do to put things right. PrePay has paid Mr S 
£100 to reflect the distress and inconvenience the delays caused Mr S. It has also returned 
the remaining £5.69. Thinking about everything that happened, Im satisfied that this is a fair 
resolution to Mr Ss complaint. I acknowledge the delay would have caused inconvenience. 
But Ive found PrePay was ultimately justified in returning the funds. I make no further award.
My final decision
For the reasons above, my final decision is that PrePay Techologies Limited has paid fair 
compensation for the delay in reviewing Mr Ss account. I make no further award.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 May 2023.
