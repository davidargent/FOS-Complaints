The complaint
Miss H complains that TransUnion International UK Limited didnt update her credit file when 
asked. Miss H wants TransUnion to compensate her for the trouble the delay caused to her.  
What happened
Miss H has a credit card account with a business I will refer to as T. In 2019, Miss H 
complained to T about its handling of her account. As a result, T amended her credit file to 
remove some missed payment markers.
Miss H noticed that TransUnion hadnt updated her credit file correctly, so she complained 
again to T in May 2020. T explained that it had sent the amendment request to TransUnion 
in December 2019. The delay in updating information lay with TransUnion and not T. 
Miss H complained to TransUnion. In March 2021, TransUnion told Miss H that the 
information was now correctly recorded and didnt uphold her complaint.
The investigator thought that TransUnion had delayed updating the information from T and 
recommended that it pay Miss H £100 compensation for the upset this caused.
TransUnion has given this service limited information and didnt reply to the investigators 
recommendation, so the complaint has come to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have very little from TransUnion other than a very short case synopsis and final response. 
This means Ive decided Miss Hs complaint based on information we have as part of her 
complaint against T and on the evidence shes given to us.
As far as Miss H was aware, T had taken steps to update her credit file at the end of 2019. I 
can appreciate that Miss H was later upset to find out that her TransUnion credit file hadnt 
updated in the way shed expected. 
Thankfully it appears the reporting by TransUnion is now correct. But I consider it fair to 
require TransUnion to compensate Miss H for the upset caused when it delayed updating 
her credit file between December 2019 and at least May 2020. The delay led to Miss H 
complaining first to T and then to TransUnion. If TransUnion had processed the amendment 
to Miss Hs credit file as T requested, Miss H wouldnt have been put to this trouble. 
I agree with the investigator that £100 is a fair reflection of the impact the delay had on    
Miss H in terms of time spent dealing with the issue and the upset caused to her.
Putting things right
TransUnion International UK Limited should pay Miss H £100 compensation. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I require TransUnion 
International UK Limited to take the step outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 November 2021.
