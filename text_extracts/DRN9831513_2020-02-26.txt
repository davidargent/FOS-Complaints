K821x#15complaint
Mr R says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 22 loans Sunny provided to Mr R between  January 2015 and March 
2018. 
Sunny has already made an offer in line with our approach for loan nine to loan twenty-two 
which is in line with our approach.  So only loans  one to eight will be considered in this 
decision.
Mr Rs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date  Taken Date 
RepaidInstalments Amount Highest monthly 
Repayment Due*
1 06/01/2015 27/05/2015 6 £200.00 £62.38
2 07/01/2015 27/04/2015 6 £100.00 £93.35
3 18/02/2015 26/06/2015 6 £200.00 £150.27
4 17/05/2015 26/06/2015 6 £200.00 £177.28
5 04/06/2015 27/08/2015 6 £350.00 £225.78
6 05/07/2015 27/11/2015 6 £250.00 £189.79
7 01/08/2015 27/11/2015 6 £200.00 £254.44
8 08/09/2015 27/11/2015 6 £200.00 £204.90
*At times,  Mr R had more  than one loan outstanding   this figure represents  the highest total due for 
all outstanding loans.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Rs complaint and thought  the loans from loan five 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. 
Sunny disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr R could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN98315132the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr R could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Rs complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan five would most likely  have 
shown that Mr R was having problems managing his money.
At this time, Mr R had another  short-term loan with a different lender  and he also had two 
outstanding loans with Sunny. Had Sunny completed proportionate checks, I think  it ought to 
have realised that Mr R may have  had problems sustainably repaying  this, and any 
subsequent loans  and decided not to continue  the lending relationship at this time. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Rs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr R was not managing  to repay  their 
loans sustainably. Mr R had taken  out six loans within six months and Mr R had been 
indebted to Sunny  for seven months. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more  
likely than not Mr R was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his 
Ref: DRN98315133previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Rs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr Rs first loan was for £200 and loan six was for £250.  At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that Mr R was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
Mr R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  eight was 
taken out nine months after Mr Rs first. And Mr R had paid large amounts of interest 
to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Rs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr R borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Rs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loan five and loans six to eight and Sunny should 
put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
if it hasnt already done so, it should put things right as offered for loans nine to 
twenty-two;
refund  all interest and charges Mr R paid on loans five to eight;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan five from Mr Rs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan six onwards  means  any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  six to eight should be removed 
from Mr Rs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr R a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 March  2020.
