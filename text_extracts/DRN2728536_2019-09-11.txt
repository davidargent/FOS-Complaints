K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains that DJS (UK) Limited,  trading as PiggyBank, lent to him irresponsibly.
Mr W is represented by a third party.
background
I attach the substantive parts of my provisional decision dated  16 August 2019, which forms 
part of this final decision and should be read with it. In it I explained why I intended to uphold  
Mr Ws complaint  in part. Both parties  had time to provide any further  comments they may 
have by 30 August  2019 before I reached  a further  decision.
Here I have used a table  of approved  loans  which was sent to us by PiggyBank. I have  
altered some  of the details having  looked at the loan agreements and the other records 
PiggyBank has sent to us. It is meant to be a summary  only. 
Originally I understood that there was an outstanding balance  on Loan 6. Recently I have  
been given evidence from Mr W to show that Loan  6 was repaid  in full in February  2019.  So 
the loan table used in my provisional decision is corrected here.

my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Mr W has sent to me screen  shots  of his account  with PiggyBank which appear to confirm  
that he has repaid  Loan 6. Apart from that he has added nothing  further.  
I have not heard from PiggyBank.
Ref: DRN27285362The date for replying to my provisional decision has passed and so I see no reason to alter 
the conclusions  I reached in my provisional decision on 16 August 2019. I uphold  Mr Ws 
complaint in relation to Loans 3 to 6. 
putting things right  what PiggyBank  needs  to do
refund  the interest and charges Mr W paid for loans 3 to 6, adding interest at 8% 
simple per year* from when Mr W paid them until the date of settlement; and
remove any negative payment information about loans 3 to 6 from Mr Ws credit  
history.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires PiggyBank  to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mr W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above and in my provisional  decision  dated 16 August 2019,  
I uphold Mr Ws complaint  in part. 
DJS (UK) Limited, trading  as PiggyBank,  should put things right for Mr W in the way I have 
set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr W to accept 
or reject my decision on or before 11 October  2019.

background
PiggyBank gave  details to Mr Ws representative  of how it approached each loan application.  This 
included noting that that Mr W had said he lived with his parents. PiggyBank  applied Office of National 
Statistics data (ONS) to increase Mr Ws outgoings figure which for him was an ONS sum of £566. 
This was included  in the calculations it says it carried out to come to Mr Ws disposable income 
figures. These were used when assessing affordability.
PiggyBank has said to us that there were times when Mr W was not its customer  and thinks these  
gaps make a difference. 
In summary PiggyBank said: In consideration of the information provided and in conjunction with the 
proportionate checks which were undertaken, there was nothing  that would give PiggyBank reason to 
believe that the loans  would be unaffordable.
In its final response to Mr Ws representative, PiggyBank offered to write off the Loan 6 balance  
about £118. Mr Ws representative has told us he did not wish to accept that. 
One of our adjudicators  looked  at the complaint  and thought that none of the loans  ought to have 
been approved. She thought that the lending  history with other  short term lenders,  revealed through 
PiggyBanks own credit  checks before Mr W applied for Loan  1, ought to have impacted on 
PiggyBanks decision.  
PiggyBank did not agree  and said that Mr W had not taken out a loan since November  2013  several 
months before Loan  1. It said that any cycle of borrowing had been broken. And during Mr Ws 
lending relationship with PiggyBank there were gaps throughout. 
The complaint remains unresolved and was passed to me for a decision.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
gaps in lending
The gap between Loans 2 and 3 was two years  and four months long. It was long enough  that it was 
reasonable for PiggyBank to treat Mr Ws application for Loan 3 as if he were a new customer. 
There is a gap after Loan 4 which stretched from the end of March  2017 to the beginning of 
September 2017  just over 5 months. My view is that this was too short a period of time to justify 
PiggyBank treating Mr Ws application for Loan 5 as a new lending  relationship in a new loan chain. I 
think that the relationship continued. 
Having made  these provisional  findings in respect of these periods,  Ive applied them  to my 
provisional findings  below. 
the loans 
PiggyBank needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr W could  repay  the loans 
in a sustainable manner. 
Ref: DRN27285364These checks could take into account a number of different things,  such as how much  was being lent, 
the repayment amounts  and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  
stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that PiggyBank should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that PiggyBank  was required to establish whether 
Mr W could  sustainably  repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  and its predecessor the Irresponsible Lending 
Guide -  defined sustainable as being  without  undue difficulties and in particular the customer  should  
be able to make repayments  on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having to borrow  to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower 
wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their 
repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
Loans 1 and 2
I can see that PiggyBank carried out credit checks before  Loans 1 and 2. In fact, comparing them they 
seem to be identical  sets of results which may be understandable as the searches were both carried  
out before loan applications  made in the same month and credit bureaus can take time to be updated.
Our adjudicator thought that the pattern  of borrowing from other short term loan (STL) lenders before 
Mr W approached it for Loan  1 was enough to mean that PiggyBank ought  not to have lent. 
PiggyBank replied that its records show that Mr Ws previous STL was in November  2013 and that 
was long enough before to have made no impact. 
I take a different view. 
Using the credit search results, Mr Ws personal  credit file and his bank statements, Mr W appears to 
have got a short term loan on 5 March 2014. I can see that he was still repaying STL all through 
January and February 2014. So I do not think  that the previous STL had been  many months before 
Loan 1 as PiggyBank  says.  
Ref: DRN27285365The search  results do show that Mr W was in the habit of taking several STL.  But at the time Mr W 
applied for Loan 1, they show  that he had one outstanding  loan with a balance of about £51. In my 
view this ought to have prompted additional questions but on balance that information  was likely to 
have been the same as that which PiggyBank had already obtained. It would have  been 
disproportionate for PiggyBank to obtain Mr Ws copy bank statements for a first loan application, so I 
would not have expected  it to have done that. 
One outstanding STL of £51 was not likely to have caused  PiggyBank too much concern. It has 
explained that it did not. PiggyBank had taken  into account Mr Ws personal living circumstances and 
the ONS statistics  to increase his perceived  outgoings figures. The lending  decision appears to have 
been taken following  proportionate  checks bearing in mind  the loan was his first one and for £50 for a 
seven day loan agreement.  The same  reasoning and facts lead me to say the same in relation  to 
Loan 2. 
So I am not planning to uphold Mr Ws complaint for Loans  1 and 2. 
Loans 3 and 4
The period of time when Mr W was not a PiggyBank customer has to have had a bearing on the 
approach it took when Mr W asked for Loan 3. It has summarised what  it did and this is set out in the 
background section of this provisional decision. I have looked  at the credit search  results produced 
by PiggyBank and seen that it has said in its final response letter  that Mr Ws credit commitments 
were between  just under £115 and just over £229. I take this to refer to payments each month.  
What I can see on the search results before Loan  3 is that Mr W did have some unsecured loans and 
at least  one home  credit account,  two credit cards  with modest  balances and one outstanding payday 
loan with a £258 balance.
His declared income at this stage was £1,248. So the £566 ONS outgoings  figure, plus the £258 plus 
the £123  (just under) for what  was going to be Loan 3, added up to at least  £947 a month.  PiggyBank  
had information that he had other unsecured  loans and other  credit commitments  (not necessarily 
STL) so the £301 left over was not likely to have covered the remaining  repayments needed  for those 
other items.  These other  commitments added up to a total balance  of £5,547 at the date PiggyBank 
carried out the search and likely to require significant sums to repay these.
So I think that this was a close enough margin  in relation to affordability to prompt  additional enquiries  
including a full review  of his finances.  That could have included viewing Mr Ws bank statements  as 
its an efficient (not the only)  method of carrying out a comprehensive review of his financial  situation. 
For the period leading up to the application  for Loan 3 PiggyBank would  have seen that Mr W spent 
money on websites and gaming sites extensively: sometimes several  hundred pounds a day. 
This information combined with PiggyBanks own research and information, plus the fact that Mr W 
was going to be indebted  to it for several  months for Loan  3 lead me to think that this was not a 
responsible lending decision. 
Loan 4 was for a similar amount but for a lesser  period of time which  meant that the instalments were 
higher at £150  a month. So for the same reasons outlined  above in relation to Loan 3, and as I have 
not seen a fundamental  change in Mr Ws financial situation when I view all the information I have,  
then I do not think that the Loan 4 approval was a responsible lending decision.
I am planning  to uphold Loans 3 and 4. 
Loans 5 and 6
Loan 5 was for £505 and with a declared income of £1,248 with repayments spread over five months 
of around £177. This was much larger than the Loan 4 application. 
Ref: DRN27285366PiggyBanks own credit  search results (which are the same set of results for both Loans 5 and 6) 
show that Mr W had four unsecured loans  one of which was marked as delinquent.  So the full 
financial review checks would have been warranted in the same way that they were for Loans 3 and 
4. I have not had any indication that Mr Ws spending on gaming sites and other sites had altered or 
abated into 2017. 
So if PiggyBank had been prompted by its own checks to carry out further and more extensive 
checks, as I think it should have done, then I think it would have realised  that Mr W was not a person 
to whom a responsible lender would  lend £505 in early September 2017 and then £900 in late 
September 2017. 
I am planning  to uphold Loans 5 and 6.
