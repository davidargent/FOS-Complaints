The complaint
Mr Ws complaint is about not being allowed to open a current account.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Its not for us to tell a bank what accounts it should allow a customer to open. 
NatWest was entitled to decide if it wanted to grant Mr W an upgraded current 
account.
Although Mr W says he was told in branch the application was acceptable NatWest 
was entitled to carry out more checks. Here it assessed Mr Ws request to upgrade 
his basic account to a current account with an overdraft. It took into account 
information on his credit file, his account history and carried out its own credit scoring 
process. Thats reasonable. But after doing so it declined to allow Mr W to upgrade 
his account, as it was entitled to do, when he didnt meet its criteria.
NatWest has acted reasonably and in line with its own processes. I have seen 
nothing to suggest it treated Mr W differently to its other customers. And its not 
obliged to give him further information on why it didnt accept his application. 
Although Mr W didnt meet NatWests criteria he may be accepted by another bank 
that has different criteria.
Overall I dont think NatWest has done anything wrong.
 
For these reasons, although I recognise Mr W's frustration, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about National Westminster Bank 
PLC. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 April 2020.
