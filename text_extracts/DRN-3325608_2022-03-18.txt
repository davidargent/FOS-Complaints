Mr B complained that 118 118 Money hadnt carried out proper checks before lending to 
him.
118 118 Money looked into his complaint. It said it had carried out proper checks and it 
thought the loans were affordable. 
Mr B referred his complaint to us. Our adjudicator upheld the complaint in part. She didnt 
think 118 118 Money should have offered Loans 4 and 5 to Mr B. 
118 118 Money accepted the outcome in respect of Loan 4 but not Loan 5. So the matter 
has been referred to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending - 
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions 
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr Bs complaint. These two 
questions are:
1. Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr B would be able to repay the loans without experiencing significant adverse 
consequences?
If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
If not, would those checks have shown that Mr B wouldve been able to do so?
2. Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
The rules and regulations in place required 118 118 Money to carry out a reasonable and 
proportionate assessment of Mr Bs ability to make the repayments under this agreement. 
This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or affordability 
check.
The checks had to be borrower-focused  so 118 118 Money had to think about whether 
repaying the loan would be sustainable. In practice this meant that the business had to 
ensure that making the repayments on the loan wouldnt cause Mr B undue difficulty or 
significant adverse consequences. That means he should have been able to meet 
repayments out of normal income without having to borrow to meet the repayments, without 
failing to make any other payment he had a contractual or statutory obligation to make and 
without the repayments having a significant adverse impact on his financial situation.
In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 Money to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr B. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of 
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they are seeking. Even 
for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
Loan 1
When Mr B applied for the loan, he told 118 118 Money that his monthly income was £3,250 
and his expenses were £1,300. 118 118 Money calculated that his expenses were more 
likely to be around £1,898.50 and used that figure. 118 118 Money carried out a credit 
search. There was nothing concerning revealed by it. Mr B had a lot of settled credit 
accounts. 
I think 118 118 Moneys checks were proportionate given the size and term of the loan and 
the value of the repayment in relation to Mr Bs monthly income. So, I dont think 118 118 
Money ought to have been concerned the loan wouldnt be sustainably affordable for Mr B. 
It follows I dont think 118 118 Money was wrong to give Mr S Loan 1. 
Loans 2 and 3
Loans 2 and 3 were similarly affordable on paper according to 118 118 Moneys 
calculations. But what had changed according to the credit search is that Mr B had taken on 
a mortgage. He was near his overdraft limits of £3,500 and £2,000 respectively. He was also 
almost up to the limit on a credit card hed only taken out a few months before applying for 
Loan 2. With each new loan he borrowed a higher amount and used part of the loan to settle 
the previous one. There was only a gap of 8 months between Loans 1 and 2 and a gap of 
10 months between Loans 2 and 3.
Due to these factors I think 118 118 Money should carried out further checks to assure itself 
that Mr B would be able to repay the loans in a sustainable way over the 24 month term. I 
think it ought to have carried out a more thorough review of Mr Bs finances. For instance it 
could have requested copies of Mr Bs bank statements. Im not suggesting here that these 
are the checks that 118 118 Money should necessarily have done. But I think looking at 
these would have given a good indication of the extent of Mr Bs financial situation at the 
relevant time. As I cant see that this was done, I dont think that the checks carried out 
before providing Mr B with these loans were reasonable and proportionate.
But that isnt the end of the matter. For me to be able to find that 118 118 Money shouldnt 
have given these loans, I have to be satisfied that by not carrying out proportionate checks 
118 118 Money has caused Mr B a loss. However, Im not able to do that here because Ive 
not been provided with any information about Mr Bs actual financial position at the time of 
these loans. In the absence of this information, I cant conclude 118 118 Money made an 
error when it approved these loans.  
Loan 4
As 118 118 Money has accepted that it shouldnt have approved this loan, I dont need to 
consider it further.
Loan 5
118 118 Money carried out a further credit search before granting the loan. The search 
showed that Mr Bs borrowing had increased. By the time of his application for Loan 5 Mr B 
owed £6,048 on an unsecured loan hed taken out a few months previously. He had four 
credit card accounts and was either close to the limit on them or in two cases, over the limit. 
He was also close to the overdraft limits of £3,000 and £3,500 on two current accounts. 
I think that and the continuing pattern of borrowing should have rung some alarm bells for 
118 118 Money. A lender ought to realise that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to do so without borrowing further. In 
this case I think 118 118 Money should have realised that Mr B had become reliant on this type of lending and it shouldnt have continued to lend to him. It follows that I dont think it 
made a fair lending decision.
Ive also thought about whether 118 118 Money acted unfairly in some other way and I 
havent seen any evidence that it did.
Putting things right
As I have concluded 118 118 Money shouldnt have provided Loans 4 and 5, it should:
  refund all interest, fees and charges applied to those loans;
pay interest* of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest, fees and charges from the 
date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement; and
remove any negative information about Loans 4 and 5 from Mr Bs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mr Bs complaint and require Madison CF UK Limited 
trading as 118 118 Money to put things right for Mr B as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 April 2022.
