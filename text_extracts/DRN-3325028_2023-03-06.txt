The complaint
Mr M complains that technical issues with Trading 212 Ltd.s platform prevented him 
from accessing his account, so he was unable to sell his positions when he wanted, causing 
him financial losses.
 
What happened
Mr Ms position
Mr M held a Contracts for Difference (CFD) account with Trading 212 Ltd (T212). On 9 
November 2020, he says he tried to access his account at 14:30 but due to a technical IT 
error on their platform, he was unable to do this. He says the following positions have been 
affected by these issues:
- POS530211244 (Aurora Cannabis), showed a profit of £1,420 but he says when he 
tried to close this in profit, the platform wouldnt allow him to do so. He saw a 
message saying No Data Available followed by another saying it could not connect 
to the server. He says by the time he was able to sell, he has lost around £3,100. 
- POS534035239 (Aurora Cannabis), he says he was unable to log in to put a stop 
loss in to break even. When he closed it, he lost around £1,280.
- POS533244454(Pfizer), POS533286371(Pfizer) he says the stop losses on these 
were triggered incorrectly when the market opened, and he would have kept these 
positions for a little longer to make a profit. He lost around £2,680 on these positions.
He says because he was prevented from accessing his account, he could not sell his 
positions and lost out on £7,000 profit. Unhappy with the loss he incurred, he complained to 
T212.
T212s position 
They issued their final response in December 2020, saying the downtime in their platform 
was due to an increased demand in the US markets following the US election results  an 
event which they say was out of their control. The terms of the client agreement he agreed to 
describe this as a Force Majeure, an event beyond their reasonable control and say they 
are not liable for any loss that may result from this event. T212 say, that in signing the client 
agreement, Mr M had specifically agreed to waive his rights to make a claim in such an 
event. 
They then proceed to consider the positions Mr M says were impacted by this event and 
whether he was in any way disadvantaged. They say three of these positions 
POS533244454(Pfizer), POS533286371(Pfizer) and PO533417285(Pfizer), were correctly 
closed using a stop loss placed by Mr M and any stop loss placed before the market was 
opened was not guaranteed. They also say based on available market price, the two Pfizer 
positions would not have returned him a profit and he must be mistaken about the price. 
In terms of losses on POS534035239 and POS530211244, T212 say these were not 
impacted by the downturn on the platform as he was showing as being online managing 
other positions on a different screen of the platform and so it was clear that platform access 
was not the issue here. Overall, they dont think he was disadvantaged by the downturn in 
the platform and didnt consider any compensation was due to Mr M. 
Unhappy with this outcome, Mr M brought his complaint to this service.
Investigators view
The investigator here didnt uphold his complaint. She says the following:-
- POS533244454  There was no attempt to close this position. A stop loss was 
placed on this and due movements in the price of the instrument the stop loss was 
triggered.
- POS533286371  Mr M didnt attempt to close this position, he added a stop loss at 
16:32:07, this position closed due to a movement in the price of the instrument which 
triggered a stop loss.
- POS534035239  A stop loss was placed at 14:36 and no attempt to close this 
position was made. The stop loss was triggered at 14:37:13.
- POS530211244  This position was manually closed at 16:37:39 around four 
minutes after the peak price.
She accepted that platform issues can happen when there is a sudden increase in demand 
but concluded she hadnt seen any evidence showing his losses were a result of T212s IT 
issues.
Mr M didnt accept the investigators view, so this has come to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In deciding what is fair and reasonable, I must consider the relevant regulation and best 
industry practice, but its for me to decide, based on the information and evidence that I have 
been given, whats more likely than not to have happened. Having done so, I am not 
upholding this complaint and for similar reasons as the investigator. I will explain further.
I think there are two main issues here. One is whether Mr M was denied access to his 
account during the period he complains of, and secondly whether T212 are responsible for 
any losses he incurred because he was unable to log into his account to sell his positions 
when he wanted to. 
Whilst I dont dismiss Mr Ms account, that system problems had happened several times 
before which meant he wasnt able to access his account, it would be unreasonable to 
expect any technology to be at 100% all of the time. That said, I would still expect the 
platform to be able to perform its functions and be fit for purpose, so I have looked 
specifically at what happened on this day. 
It is not in dispute that there was downtime in the platform on 9 November 2020. It was the 
first opening of the US markets following the US elections and it was not uncommon for such 
world events to cause high traffic and market volatility. In these circumstances it is 
understood that the increased level of activity would mean there would have been a demand 
on their servers and platform. T212 have relied on the terms of their client agreement, 
particularly clause 25 Force majeure which says:-Whilst we endeavour to comply with our obligations in a timely manner, we shall 
incur no liability whatsoever for any partial or full default of our obligations by reason 
of any cause or event beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to any 
communications, systems or computer failure, market default, suspension, failure or 
closure, or the imposition or change (including a change in interpretation) of any law 
or governmental or regulatory requirement and we shall not be held liable for any 
loss you may incur as a result.
I am satisfied with T212s explanation that the US elections was most likely cause of surge in 
demand on their servers and platform and that this a Force Majeure - an event that was 
outside of their reasonable control. I dont think it is fair or reasonable to use an event 
outside of their reasonable control to determine that the platform wasnt fit for purpose or that 
they had acted outside of their terms and conditions. In signing the Client Agreement, Mr M 
agreed to the terms outlined and in clause 7.8 waived his right to any claims against them in 
these circumstances. 
You hereby agree and acknowledge that in the event of downtime of the Trading 
Platform You shall waive any claims against Trading 212 of missed profits and/or 
claims that You would have executed an order on a specific price during the 
downtime.
Even if I was to find that T212 were unfair in terms of Mr M not being able to log into his 
account, I have considered how his individual positions closed and whether his losses were 
as a result of the downtime. He says he was unable to log into his account on the platform at 
14:30 due to these IT issues so it prevented him from selling his positions. When he was 
later able to sell, he lost a total of around £7,000 profit. Ive looked at each of the positions 
hes said were affected by this.
POS533244454 (Pfizer) and POS533286371 (Pfizer)
Mr M said he couldnt access his account at 14:30 and lost profit as he was not able to close 
these positions. Ive looked at his account information which shows he placed a stop loss on 
POS533244454 at 13:36:52 and POS533286371 at 14:32:07. The movement in price 
triggered the stop loss and the positions closed at 14:34:46 and 14:36:27 respectively. At the 
time POS533286371 closed, Mr M was placing a stop loss on another position 
POS534035239. The evidence Ive seen shows these positions closed when the stop loss 
was correctly triggered.
To address Mr Ms point that he would have made a profit on the Pfizer positions if he had 
kept these open. These positions were opened at 41.56 and 41.68 respectively and the 
market on 9 November 2020 at its peak reached 41.044, so despite Mr Ms believe that he 
would have made a profit on his Pfizer positions, there is no evidence to support this would 
have happened.
POS534035239 (Aurora Cannabis) and POS530211244 (Aurora Cannabis)
His account information also shows Mr M placed a stop loss on another Pfizer position 
POS33820808 at 14:32:07 and on POS534035239 at 14:36. This stop loss triggered at 
14:37:13 while it seems he was closing POS530211244, which he closed at a profit on 
14:37:39. The evidence Ive seen suggests POS534035239 closed because the stop loss 
was correctly triggered.
Mr M was able to access his account to place a stop loss at 14:32:07 which appears to be 
the first action hes taken. There is no evidence hes tried to close any of his positions at this 
point. The evidence hes provided show there was no data available at 14:33, 14:35 and 14:37, but there is clear evidence as outlined above, that Mr M was actively placing stop 
losses and closing positions on the platform within the same timeframe that he is 
complaining about. 
While I accept, he may have had initial IT issues with accessing the platform, Im not 
persuaded this was the reason for not being able to close these positions. Looking at the 
information available, I am satisfied that he was reasonably able to access and trade on his 
account as explained above. I appreciate Mr M will be disappointed with my decision, but on 
balance, I cant say T212 were responsible for his losses so I wont be asking them to do 
anything.
My final decision
My final decision is that I am not upholding this complaint against Trading 212 Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 April 2023.
