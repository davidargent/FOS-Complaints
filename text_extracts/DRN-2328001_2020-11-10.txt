DRN-2328001
The complaint
Mrs P complains about end of contract charges when her agreement with Mercedes-Benz 
Financial Services UK Limited ended. 
What happened
I issued a provisional decision explaining why I didnt propose to uphold this complaint. In 
summary, I concluded that all of the damage exceeded fair wear and tear in accordance with 
the BVLRA guidelines and that the charges had been fairly applied. In particular I concluded 
that the LHF wheel was buckled and I explained why I was persuaded that this damage was 
present at the time of the inspection.
I invited Mrs P and MBFS to let me have any further evidence or arguments they wanted to 
make before I finally determined the matter.
Mrs P didnt respond to my provisional decision. MBFS responded and said it had already 
provided all the information it wanted to.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs P hasnt responded to my provisional decision. MBFS responded but hasnt said 
whether it agrees with it or not. I havent seen any further information or arguments which 
give me reason to reach different conclusions to the ones I set out in my provisional 
decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2020.
