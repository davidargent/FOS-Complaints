The complaint
Mr M is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) shared his personal 
information with third parties when reviewing direct debit indemnity claims hed submitted.
What happened
Mr M submitted some direct debit indemnity claims to NatWest. When considering those 
claims, NatWest contacted the businesses involved as part of their review. Mr M wasnt 
happy about this and felt that NatWest had shared his personal information with those third-
party businesses without his consent. So, he raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Mr Ms complaint but didnt feel theyd acted unfairly as Mr M believed. Mr 
M wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to this service. One 
of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also didnt feel that NatWest had acted 
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation, and so didnt uphold the complaint. Mr M 
remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This service isnt a regulatory body or a Court of Law. As such, it isnt within my remit here to 
declare whether NatWest have acted in a non-regulatory or unlawful manner. Such 
declarations would be for a regulatory body or a Court of Law to potentially make. Instead, 
this service is an informal, impartial dispute resolution service with a remit based on fairness 
of outcome.
In this instance, Mr M feels that NatWest should have had the information needed to process 
his direct debit indemnity claims without needing to contact the relevant businesses, given 
that NatWest confirm that they retain direct debit information for a period of seven years. 
However, the direct debit indemnity claims submitted by Mr M attempted to reclaim direct 
debits going back to 2005 in one instance and 2011 in two other instances  all of which 
predate the seven years of records that NatWest confirms that it keeps. It therefore seems 
fair to me that in order to process Mr Ms claims, NatWest would reasonably need to contact 
the relevant business in regard to those claims as they did.
Similarly, in a more general sense, it seems fair to me that if Mr M was asking NatWest to 
recover historical direct debit payments  even potentially direct debits made within any 
period that NatWest might retain records of those direct debits  its tacitly accepted within 
that request that NatWest may need to contact the relevant businesses to discuss the claims 
so as to ascertain their validity. Indeed, from a fairness perspective, this feels like common 
sense to me. And I dont feel that Mr M can reasonably ask NatWest to recover direct debit 
payments from close to 20 years ago and not fairly expect NatWest to attempt to do so 
without contacting the relevant businesses to discuss those claims.
As such, I dont feel that there has been an unfair outcome here, and it follows from this that 
I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action. 
I reiterate that this decision is made within the remit of this service as an informal dispute 
resolution service with a remit based on fairness of outcome and isnt in any way a 
declaration that NatWest have of havent acted in a non-regulatory or unlawful manner. 
If Mr M continues to feel that NatWest have acted in a non-regulatory manner, I can only 
refer him to the Information Commissioners Office, who are the relevant regulatory body in 
this instance.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 February 2023.
