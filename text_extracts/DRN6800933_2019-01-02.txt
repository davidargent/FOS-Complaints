K821x#15complaint
Mrs L complains  about issues shes experienced with a car supplied with finance from 
Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited.
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint, a copy  of which  is attached and forms part 
of this final decision.
In my provisional decision I explained  why I proposed to uphold Mrs Ls complaint and to 
require Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited  to reimburse Mrs L for the repair costs 
shes incurred and pay compensation. 
I invited Mrs L and Volkswagen Financial  Services  (UK) Limited  to let me have any further  
evidence or arguments  they wanted to make before I finally  determined  the matter.
Mrs L said she was pleased with my provisional  decision.  Volkswagen  Financial Services 
(UK) Limited didnt reply  to my provisional decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs L has indicated that she accepts my provisional decision. Volkswagen Financial 
Services (UK) Limited hasnt said anything at all. So I see no reason to reach  different 
conclusions from the ones I set out in my provisional  decision.
my final decision
For these reasons  as well as those set out in more detail in my provisional decision  my 
final decision  is to uphold  the complaint. Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited 
should:
Reimburse Mrs L for the sum of £2500 which shes incurred towards  the cost of the 
new engine together with 8% simple interest per annum from the date of payment  to 
the date of settlement
Pay compensation of £350 to Mrs l for distress  and inconvenience
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 February  2019.
