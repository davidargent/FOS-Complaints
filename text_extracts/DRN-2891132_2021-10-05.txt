The complaint
Mr P complains about the low maturity value he was paid on his forty-five year investment, 
which Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited (Aviva) was responsible for. He considers he should 
have been paid more.
What happened
In September 2019, Aviva sent Mr P a maturity value for his policy which was due to mature 
in mid- October 2019. His maturity value was £11,291.51, having paid a premium of £4.88 
per month throughout, over a forty-five year term. Mr P is unhappy with the return generated 
by this investment.
Aviva told Mr P his maturity value was calculated as follows:
Sum Assured £2000
Reversionary bonus  £3820.37
Total £5820.37
Terminal Bonus Rate 94%
Terminal Bonus £5471.14
Total maturity value £11,291.51
Mr P said, through his adviser, that this reflected a low average annual growth rate of 6.1% 
on investable premiums and that a normal expectation, despite the uncertainties created in 
the with profits life funds market caused by government intervention, wouldve been 8-10% 
for this term.
Mr Ps adviser expressed concern, in summary, that the lost value in the policy may have 
been due to:
the bonus rates and extraordinary charges payable;
the impact on bonus rates caused by different ownership of the fund; and/or
the terminal bonuses payable.
The adviser also pointed out his criticism of the way the Government meddled in the with 
profits market and the regulatory issues this caused between 2000 and 2003.
Mr P, through his adviser, raised these concerns with Aviva. The adviser asked Aviva to 
provide him with some additional background information regarding the calculation of the 
maturity value, in particular:
(1) the bonus rates or bonuses added to the original sum assured at each anniversary since 1974, 
when the policy was taken out;
(2) the reversionary bonuses added at each anniversary since inception; and
(3) the terminal bonus rate history for policies with a term of 25-45 years at each policy anniversary for 
a maturing 45-year policy, from inception, 
Aviva responded to Mr Ps advisers inquiries, over several responses, providing, in 
summary, the following additional information:
the maturity value represented an average annual return of 6.6% against the premiums
invested over the period of investment. The average annual return achieved by the fund was 
7.3%.
the return on the premiums was lower than the return on the fund, reflecting the effect of 
charges.
the return was based on a premium of £3.63 per month. The total monthly premium was
£4.88, but this included £0.30 per month to cover £2,000.00 Accident Benefit and £0.95 per 
month for decreasing term assurance, both of which were not part of the with profit fund 
returns. 
there were no extraordinary charges, any charges were included in the premiums.
the Reversionary Bonuses increased from 2013 onwards; (they were zero from 2002 to 
2012).
the Reversionary Bonuses increased each year as follows:
31/12/2012 £3563.04
31/12/2013 £3598.67
31/12/2014 £3634.66
31/12/2015 £3652.83
31/12/2016 £3671.09
31/12/2017 £3685.27
31/12/2018 £3727.91
pre 2002 bonus system information was not migrated over when the business 
changed. The only bonus information available before 2002, was the first bonus 
amount.
Final bonus rates are not guaranteed until a claim arises.
Sample final bonus rates, for the period commencing 1 October 2019 were:
Term in years Final bonus rates
20 0%
25 69%
30 59%
35 65%
40 70%
45 94%
50 165%
Aviva also explained how with-profits plans worked and highlighted the Principles 
and Practices of Financial Management (PPFM). Aviva explained that with-profit 
funds hadnt performed as well as had been expected, It apologised for not being 
able to provide a more positive response about the value of the fund.
Mr P didnt agree that he had been provided with a fair maturity value. So, he brought his 
complaint to our service. Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Ps complaint. Mr P asked for his 
complaint to be referred to an ombudsman.
In summary, Mr Ps adviser said that our investigator had not understood the product, the 
issues involved and had not thoroughly investigated the complaint. Mr Ps adviser said he 
had set out the basis of his concerns in his letter of 30 January 2020, and this should be 
referred to when determining this case.
As agreement couldnt be reached Mr Ps complaint comes to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have looked carefully at Mr Ps letter of complaint of 30 January 2020 and the further 
correspondence exchanged between Aviva and Mr Ps adviser regarding the maturity value.
I appreciate Mr Ps disappointment that his maturity value is not as high as he was expecting 
after investing with Aviva and its predecessors over a forty-five year term. I also appreciate it 
must be particularly frustrating to feel that the performance of this policy may not have 
possibly matched the performance achieved elsewhere.
Looking at the information I have seen, I think Aviva has reviewed the maturity value 
provided, and I dont think there is anything that suggests this value was incorrectly 
calculated and should be higher. I understand that the policy Mr P has complained about 
doesnt seem to have performed as well as he hoped or indeed as well as his adviser says 
others seem to have done, but this doesnt mean Aviva has done anything wrong. 
I understand that performance and returns in relation to with-profits investments can be 
tricky to understand and the information is not that opaque. With-profits funds have attracted 
criticism for their lack of transparency. I also accept that it can be difficult for policy holders to 
satisfy themselves they have received what they are entitled to under the terms of their 
investment. I think Aviva has responded here in a fair way to Mr Ps requests for additional 
information, providing fairly the information available to it, to explain how the maturity value 
was reached.
The growth achieved by an investment in a with-profits fund depends on the level of bonuses 
awarded by the business, which in turn depends on the underlying performance of the 
assets in the fund. The level of growth is not guaranteed and the way smoothing is applied, 
for example, will also have an impact. Aviva is accountable to the industry regulator for the 
way in which it operates its with-profits fund in accordance with its Principles and Practices 
of Financial Management document (PPFM), and the regulator monitors the management of 
it. Businesses are required to appoint a with-profits actuary and the regulator provides rules 
and guidance on their duties. I have not seen any persuasive evidence to show that Aviva 
has mismanaged the with-profits fund in which Mr P is invested, or that his maturity value is 
incorrect. 
Here, I can see that a number of different businesses were responsible for Mr Ps investment 
over the forty-five year term. As Mr Ps adviser points out, this was a particularly long-term 
investment, so its perhaps not surprising that there were some business changes over this 
period, although I can see there were quite a number. I have not seen anything which 
persuades me that changes in business entity has, of itself, caused Mr P to lose out. Nor 
have I seen any evidence of Mr P being charged extraordinary charges as a result of these 
changes.
For these reasons, I do not consider that Aviva has done anything wrong. I therefore do not 
uphold Mr Ps complaint.
My final decision
 I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 November 2021.
