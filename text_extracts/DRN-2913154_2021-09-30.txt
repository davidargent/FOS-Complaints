The complaint
Mr C complains that Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) mismanaged his credit card account.
What happened
Mr C had a credit card with Lloyds. On 19 November 2020, Lloyds agreed to transfer a credit 
balance of £1263.47 on Mr Cs credit card to his Lloyds bank account. This refund wasnt 
made. On 27 November 2020, Lloyds transferred the credit balance of £849.91 to his Lloyds 
account. In January 2021, two amounts of £1263.47 and £849.91 were debited to Mr Cs 
credit card account.
Mr C complained. He said that because the debits to his card account were made late, he 
thought he had more money than he had  and had spent it. So  he shouldnt have to pay it 
back to Lloyds. It should be written off.
Lloyds said theyd made a mistake in not debiting the money from Mr Cs credit card in 
November 2020 as they should have. But the amount on Mr Cs card was what he owed, 
and he had to repay it. But because theyd made an error, they offered Mr C compensation 
of £150. And to help him through the period where he couldnt pay off the credit card, they 
also waived interest on the card account for six months from January 2021. Mr C didnt 
accept Lloyds offer of compensation.
Mr C brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Lloyds had made an error in that the 
debits to Mr Cs credit card were delayed to January 2021. But  he owed the money to 
Lloyds and it had to be repaid. He could see that only one transfer of £849.91 was made  
as the first request made by Mr C wasnt processed. He considered that the compensation 
offered by Lloyds was fair for what had happened.
Mr C didnt agree and asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive listened to the calls made by Mr C in November 2020. On the call on 19 November 
2020, Mr C realised that two repayments had been made to his card account  because the 
direct debit had been paid, and in addition, he had made a manual payment. He asked that 
the credit balance was transferred to his current account. The call handler worked out that 
this was £1263.47 after considering pending transactions. Mr C agreed to this. On 26 
November 2020, Mr C called again and asked that the credit balance was returned to his 
bank account. The call handler worked out that it was £849.91  after pending transactions. 
Mr C agreed that this would be transferred to his bank account. He also asked that the direct 
debit be cancelled  so he would make manual payments only going forward.
I can see that the first transfer of £1263.47 was made. Mr Cs bank account was credited 
with that amount. But, on the second call  the call handler appeared to calculate the credit 
balance without realising that the first transfer of £1263.47 had been made - because that 
amount hadnt been debited to the credit card account. So  he calculated amount of 
£849.91 was the new amount - being the credit balance of £1263.47 (from 19 November 
2020), from which further purchases of £413.56 had been made in the meantime. £849.91 
was then transferred to Mr Cs bank account on 27 November 2020. So  in summary, Mr 
Cs bank account was credited with £1263.47 too much. This was an error by Lloyds.
But  Lloyds then made another error. Due to systems problems, the debits to the credit card 
werent processed until 5 January 2021  when debits of £1263.47 and £849.91 were put 
through  just over a month later than they shouldve been. Mr C argues that he thought 
theyd gone through in November  and therefore he had spent the money when it was 
transferred to his bank accounts. And now  he had a debt on his credit card which was 
unforeseen. The debt on his statement in January 2021 was £3387.89. He says  he 
shouldnt have to pay back the amounts of £1263.47 and £849.91.
On his complaint, I dont agree that Mr C isnt responsible for the debt. He did receive 
statements in December 2020 and then in January 2021 which show the position on his 
credit card. I can also see that he checked his card account and bank accounts regularly 
online. So  he had the information available to him to see what had happened. I agree that 
Lloyds made a mistake, but I dont think that means its fair that Mr C doesnt pay back the 
amount of the transfers. As I see it, this was still a valid debt which Mr C had to repay.
Lloyds apologised for their mistake and offered compensation of £150, and they put in place 
a six-month interest free period from January 2021 on Mr Cs credit card - to help him pay 
the amounts back. And  they did this quickly, as soon as the issue arose. So - I think this 
was reasonable by Lloyds in the circumstances. 
And so  I am not asking Lloyds to do anymore here. Mr C has rejected Lloyds offer of 
compensation of £150. I assume that this offer still stands, and if Mr C wishes to accept that, 
he should contact Lloyds to organise for it to be paid to him.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2021.
