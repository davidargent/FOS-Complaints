K821x#15complaint
Mr R complains about the short term loans he took out with Active Securities Limited  trading  
as 247Moneybox.  Mr R says that he became dependent  on these payday loans. He says 
that the lending made  his financial situation  worse  and if 247Moneybox  had made  better 
checks it wouldve seen this and not lent to him.
background
Mr R took out six payday loans  between  June 2015 and July 2016. 247Moneybox didnt 
provide a business file and it hasnt confirmed what it lent to Mr R. However,  I understand 
247Moneybox approved  the following loans:
number date startedamount  
borroweddate ended
1 12/06/2015 £80.00 01/07/2015
2 20/07/2015 £155.00 01/09/2015
3 22/09/2015 £230.00 30/10/2015
4 02/11/2015 not known 29/04/2016
5 10/06/2016 £410.00 01/07/2016
6 24/07/2016 £429.00 14/06/2017
Mr R repaid £327 for loan 4. So its likely that he wouldve  borrowed a lower amount than 
this. 
247Moneybox has looked at Mr Rs complaint and said that it shouldnt  be upheld. It said 
that it did appropriate checks for all of the lending. And these checks showed  that the loans 
were affordable.
One of our adjudicators looked  at what Mr R and 247Moneybox said.  He thought  Mr Rs 
complaint should  be partially upheld. He thought that it had made  proportionate checks  for 
loans 1 to 3. So he thought that 247Moneyboxs  decisions to lend were reasonable for these 
loans. 
He didnt think that 247Moneybox  had made proportionate checks for loans 4 to 6. He 
thought if it had then it still wouldve agreed  to loans 4 and 5. But it wouldnt have approved 
loan 6. This is because  he didnt think that Mr R could afford the repayments.  And 
247Moneybox wouldve  seen this had it completed  better checks.  
247Moneybox agreed with our adjudicator and offered to settle the complaint  in the way the 
adjudicator recommended. Our adjudicator informed Mr R about this. However Mr R didnt 
respond to the offer. So as no agreements  been reached the complaints been passed to 
me to me to issue a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Ref: DRN94138742Having done so, Ive decided to partially  uphold Mr Rs complaint.  Having  reviewed the 
evidence I have available I think 247Moneybox  was wrong to have given Mr R loan 6. Ill 
explain why.
Before lending money to a consumer a lender should take proportionate steps to understand 
whether they will be able to repay what theyre  borrowing  in a sustainable manner. A lender 
should gather enough  information for it to be able to make an informed  decision on the 
lending. The lending shouldnt adversely impact  a consumers  financial  situation. 
The guidance and rules themselves didnt set out compulsory  checks.  But they are clear that 
any checks needed to be proportionate and could take into account a number of different 
things. This could include how much was being  lent, the size of the repayments  and what  the 
lender found out about the consumer. 
So Ive firstly looked at whether 247Moneybox  performed proportionate checks. If I think that 
the checks were proportionate then it usually wouldve been reasonable for it to lend. But if 
247Moneybox didnt do proportionate  checks,  Ive looked at whether  it wouldve  been 
apparent to it that the loan repayments  were affordable had it done  better  checks. 
247Moneybox should  put things right if its likely to have then found that the loan repayments  
were unaffordable.   
Mr R didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 5. Because of this its not 
clear if there is any ongoing  disagreement about  these loans. And 247Moneybox has made 
an offer to settle  the complaint about loan 6. So Ill only comment  briefly on 247Moneyboxs 
decisions to approve  these loans. 
Ive seen a record  of the information Mr R provided  when he completed his loan applications 
for loans  1 to 3. This showed that Mr R wouldve been able to afford  the loan repayments. 
I havent seen  anything in the rest of the information provided, at this stage, to suggest  that it 
was unreasonable for 247Moneybox to rely on this information. So I dont think  further 
checks were needed  given the proportion  of the amount being borrowed in relation to what  
Mr R declared  as his monthly  disposable income. So Im not upholding Mr Rs complaint  
about loans 1 to 3.
By the time Mr R took loan 4 he had been  borrowing from 247Moneybox  for not far short  of a 
year. The amounts he borrowed  started  to increase and he went on to have problems  
repaying loan 4. I think these factors indicate  that Mr R may have been having  some 
financial difficulties over this period of lending. 
I think for loan 4 that it wouldve  been proportionate to find out about Mr Rs normal  monthly 
living costs  and financial commitments including any existing short-term lending.  And I think 
that for loans 5 and 6 that it needed to verify this information to get an accurate picture of Mr 
Rs finances. 
I dont think 247Moneybox did this here. It only obtained information  about Mr Rs income  
and regular expenditure. So I need  to think about  what 247Moneybox wouldve seen if it had 
carried out proportionate checks.
Mr R has provided some  information about his financial  circumstances. Looking at what  he 
has provided Im unable to say that 247Moneybox  wouldve seen  that loans 4 and 5 werent  
affordable. So Im not upholding  Mr Rs complaint about loans 4 and 5.
Ref: DRN94138743But by the time 247Moneybox approved loan 6, looking at Mr Rs bank statements, it seems 
that his income  had fallen. And 247Moneybox  has agreed with our adjudicators  opinion  that 
it shouldve seen that Mr R wouldnt have been able repay  loan 6 in a sustainable way 
because of this. 
So I think that 247Moneybox shouldnt have  given loan 6 to Mr R and I think  hes lost out as 
a result of this. So Im upholding  Mr Rs complaint about loan 6.
what 247Moneybox should do to put things  right
To put things right for Mr R, 247Moneybox should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loan 6; and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement;
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Rs credit  file about this loan
HM Revenue & Customs requires 247Moneybox to take off tax from this interest. 
247Moneybox must give Mr R a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for 
one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Rs complaint.
Active Securities Limited should put things right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 February  2019.
