The complaint
Mr K complains that Tesco Personal Finance PLC (Tesco) charged him a late payment fee 
and interest after the end of his balance transfer period.
What happened
Mr M had an18-month interest-free balance transfer offer from Tesco. It was due to expire 
on 18 February 2022. Up to then, he paid the minimum amount of £25 each month on a 
regular basis  by direct debit. On 28 January 2022, Tesco wrote to Mr K to say the offer 
was ending on 18 February 2022  after then the interest rate increased to 18.324% APR. 
On 18 January 2022, Tesco sent him a statement which showed the balance due was 
£1,322.46  payable by 12 February 2022. The statement showed a direct debit payment of 
£25 would be taken on 12 February 2022. Mr K called Tesco on 6 February 2022 to discuss 
the letter he had received and the payments due on his account.
Mr K complained. He said the direct debit had been cancelled for the February 2022 
payment and wasnt told it would be. He was charged a late payment fee and interest as a  
result. He said this was unfair and Tesco were using unscrupulous and underhand tactics to 
increase profits.
Tesco said they listened to the call on 6 February 2022. On the call, Mr K asked to change 
his direct debit to the full balance. The call handler agreed to do that but said it would take 
effect from the next statement. Therefore the payment for the statement dated 18 January 
2022 should be paid manually, and Mr K agreed with that. Tescos call handler then told Mr 
K how he could do that - via his bank or online banking. 
Tesco said Mr Ks direct debit was then changed from taking the minimum payment to full 
balance, but a manual payment was needed for the January 2022 statement. Because no 
manual payment was received by the due date of 12 February 2022, a late payment fee of 
£12 was charged. When Mr K called later, on 16 February 2022, Tesco agreed to refund the 
late payment fee and waived interest for one month. And on that call, took Mr Ks payment of 
£1,310.46.
Mr K didnt agree and brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Tesco acted 
reasonably. She said Tesco charged the late fee of £12 and interest correctly  as the 
manual payment hadnt been made by Mr K. But Tesco had refunded the fee and waived 
interest as a gesture of goodwill in any case. She noted that Mr K had sent some emails to 
Tescos CEO but as these were after the referral of his complaint to our service, Tesco didnt 
need to take any action on those.
Mr K asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint. He said that on the call on 6 February 
2022  he wasnt told the direct debit for £25 due on 12 February 2022 was to be cancelled 
 as this caused the problems. So  his complaint has come to me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of Mr Ks complaint hinges on the call on 6 February 2022  which Ive listened to. 
On it, Mr K asked that his direct debit was changed to collect the full balance. Tescos call 
handler agreed to do that  and said it would only take effect from the next statement (i.e. 
the statement dated 18 February 2022, for payment by 15 March 2022). And so  the call 
handler said the payment due to be made in February 2022 had to be paid by Mr K 
manually. Mr K agreed with that. The call handler advised Mr K how he could do that  
through his bank or online banking. Mr K agreed with that. Mr K then asked about a disputed 
transaction  which isnt relevant to this complaint.
But  what Mr K is saying is that the call handler didnt go as far as saying the direct debit 
due on 12 February 2022 would be cancelled (as it was being replaced by that due in March 
2022). Thats the point that our investigator  and Tesco  havent addressed  so I 
appreciate where Mr K is coming from. And I can also see that on the statement dated 18 
January 2022  it says payment due date 12 February 2022. Minimum payment 
£25.00We will collect your minimum payment direct debit of £25 on 12/02/2022 or soon 
after. Therefore  I think Mr K assumed that the direct debit would go through (for £25), and 
he would then pay off what was left. He would then have avoided the late payment fee and 
interest for the month. And he then paid £1,310.46 on 16 February 2022.
Therefore I need to consider whether it could be expected that Tescos call handler 
shouldve told Mr K that the direct debit for £25 due 12 February 2022 would be cancelled. 
On the one hand, Tesco would say that the February direct debit was replaced by the new 
one due in March 2022. On the other hand, Mr K would argue he wasnt to know that. In all 
honesty, on balance - I think it wouldve been reasonable for the call handler to have told Mr 
K that. But I then must consider whether that justifies whether Mr Ks complaint should be 
upheld and an amount of compensation awarded. And I dont think it does in the 
circumstances of what happened and the actions that Tesco took.
I say that as in this case, Tesco put things right immediately  within a few days. They 
refunded the late payment fee  and waived any interest payable for the month.  So  Mr K 
was put back in the position he wouldve been in. And that is one of the guiding principles 
this service operates by.
So overall, on balance, I think the outcome  the refund of the £12 fee and waiver of interest 
- was a fair and reasonable way for both parties to resolve this dispute. And I wont be 
asking Tesco to do anymore here.
After bringing his complaint to this service, Mr K sent emails to Tescos CEO  this raised 
the same complaint points. And as his complaint has now reached a final decision by our 
service, Tesco do not need to respond to those again. (continued)
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 March 2023.
