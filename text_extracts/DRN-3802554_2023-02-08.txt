The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) are holding him liable for a 
loan he says he didnt apply for.
What happened
The background to this complaint is well known to both parties and so Ill only refer to some 
key events here.
A £14,600 loan was applied for in Mr Ds name with NatWest through his online banking on 
27 September 2020. It paid off an existing joint loan Mr D had with his wife (Mrs D) that was 
set up in 2018 and the remaining funds, about £6,000, were paid into his bank account. 
The monthly loan repayments were made until October 2021, when Mr and Mrs D visited a 
NatWest branch and  with this assistance of branch staff  he called the relevant fraud 
department to report he hadnt taken out the loan. A debit card payment for about £6,500 
made on 13 October 2020 to a car garage from Mr and Mrs Ds joint bank account was also 
disputed. NatWest refunded this payment.
After not hearing from NatWest about the loan, he contacted them in November 2021 and 
complained. NatWest provided a final response to Mr Ds complaint which, in short, said:
Following an investigation carried out by their ID theft team, a decision was made to 
decline the claim. And, as no fraud was found, a response wasnt sent out which is in 
line with their processes  so the loan remained in Mr Ds name.
Mr Ds online banking was disabled, in line with their processes, as funds were 
reported as being moved between accounts without Mr Ds permission.
Theyd followed the correct processes with Mr Ds fraud case and there hadnt been 
a bank error. 
The complaint was considered by one of our investigators that thought NatWest had acted 
fairly by holding Mr D liable for the loan. He said NatWest had shown Mr D logged onto his 
online banking the day the loan was applied for. And he didnt think it was plausible the loan 
was applied for fraudulently, or that NatWest processed it by mistake, given it was used to 
pay off an existing loan, with the rest paid into Mr Ds account for his use. He also hadnt 
seen anything to show it wasnt Mr D who applied for the loan.
Our investigator noted there was a disputed payment for about £6,500 made shortly after the 
loan was applied for but he hadnt seen any anything to suggest it was linked. He also 
explained that Mr D couldnt access his online banking as it had been disabled when the 
loan went into debt recovery, as per NatWests policy. Our investigator further added that, 
while Mr D has questioned the evidence NatWest had provided the Financial Ombudsman, 
he had no reason to question its authenticity.
Mr D disagreed and so the matter has been passed to me to decide. In short, hes added:
He doesnt dispute the money went into his account. But he didnt apply for it and 
NatWest cant provide the evidence to show he did. And, had NatWest not set the 
loan up, the existing 2018 loan wouldve now been repaid. 
He only became aware of the loan when he received a statement 12 months later. 
And he didnt notice it earlier due to the repayments being similar to those for the 
2018 loan. 
He hasnt received any proof the loan was taken out despite numerous requests for 
this information  which he says NatWest ignored. Whereas he always received 
confirmation of previous loans taken out. And he questions why NatWest has 
provided the Financial Ombudsman evidence of the loan but refused his requests. 
NatWest immediately stopped him accessing online banking which made it 
impossible to check his bank and credit card statements/balances. The investigator 
was wrong to say his online banking was disabled due to the loan going to debt 
recovery as it happened before this. 
Upon becoming aware of the loan, he went to a NatWest branch and branch staff 
asked  in relation to the £6,500 payment  if Mr and Mrs D had bought a car from 
the garage named on the bank account statement. Mrs D confirmed they hadnt and 
within minutes NatWest refunded the £6,500 payment. They never went into the 
branch to report the payment as fraudulent. So how did NatWest think this was a 
fraudulent payment when they didnt make such a claim?
Since then, hed spoken to a garage that they did purchase a car from at that time for 
the same value. The garage explained that the payment was processed under their 
previous trading name  which was the one shown on the bank statement - as it 
couldnt be changed at the time due to the covid-19 pandemic. The garage confirmed 
they hadnt heard anything from NatWest about the payment. So, he questions why 
NatWest refunded the payment without carrying out any form of enquiry or 
investigation. Yet his dispute about the loan has been ongoing for more than 12 
months without being provided the documentation he requested. 
Although NatWest has provided the bank account statements, he doesnt think 
theyve provided evidence to show he took out the loan. He feels this loan was taken 
out internally by NatWest, or was an administration error, that theyre trying to cover 
up by providing false information.
The IP address used to access online banking when the loan was applied for doesnt 
prove he did so. This is because, NatWest already had it and theyve already 
provided false information and lied about what happened. 
Hes received threatening letters from the debt recovery company asking for 
payment. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I want to reassure Mr D that Ive given careful consideration to everything hes said in 
support of his complaint. I appreciate he feels very strongly about this matter as he says he didnt apply for the loan. I also understand that receiving debt collection letters, due to Mr D 
stopping the repayments in October 2021, has been very worrying for him and his wife. But 
Ill concentrate my comments on what I think is relevant. So, if I dont mention any specific 
point, its not because Ive failed to take it on board and think about it, but because I dont 
think I need to comment on it to reach what I think is a fair and reasonable outcome. Having 
done so, Ive reached the same outcome as our investigator as I think NatWest has acted 
fairly by holding Mr D liable for the loan. Ill explain why. 
Id firstly like to acknowledge Mr Ds concerns about the evidence NatWest provided the 
Financial Ombudsman as he thinks theyve provided false information and/or lied about what 
happened. While Ive noted his concerns, Ive no reason to question the legitimacy of the 
information received from NatWest and I havent seen anything to support Mr Ds claim in 
this respect. I therefore think its reasonable for to me take the evidence provided by 
NatWest into consideration here. 
The loan was applied for via Mr Ds online banking and so, if it was fraudulent, the person 
who made the application wouldve had to have known Mr Ds banking and log on details. 
NatWests records also show the IP address used to access Mr Ds online banking when the 
loan was applied for had been used previously. This doesnt confirm Mr D applied for the 
loan but it does demonstrate that it was applied for using his personal computer. And I 
havent seen anything to suggest another person had access to Mr Ds personal computer, 
or that Mr Ds online banking and log on details were shared or accessible to anyone else. 
Ive also considered what happened to the loan funds, with the majority (about £8,600) used 
to repay an existing loan and the rest (about £6,000) paid into Mr Ds account. At the time 
Mr D informed NatWest he hadnt applied for the loan, the card payment for about £6,500 to 
the car garage  made shortly after the loan was set up - was also disputed. NatWest 
refunded this payment but its since come to light that, while Mr and Mrs D didnt recognise 
the car garage named on their bank statement at the time, they did make that payment but 
the car garage processed it under their previous trading name (which explains why Mr and 
Mrs D didnt recognise it). 
The car garage payment was therefore a genuine transaction. Mr D also hasnt suggested or 
put forward any suspicious or fraudulent transaction activity on his bank account after the 
loan funds were received. And, in situations whereby a loan is applied for fraudulently, Id 
expect the funds to have been used for the benefit of the fraudster. I therefore wouldnt have 
expected the existing loan to be repaid or the surplus funds to have remained in Mr Ds 
account for his benefit. Because of this, I find it highly unlikely the loan was applied for 
fraudulently. 
Mr D has asked why the £6,500 card payment was considered fraudulent by NatWest given 
he didnt visit the branch with his wife to make such a claim. He also questions why NatWest 
refunded the payment so quickly without carrying out any form of enquiry or investigation. 
Ive noted Mr Ds concerns here but, as Ive explained, when credit is fraudulently taken out 
the funds would ordinarily be used for the benefit of the fraudsters. So, given Mr D told 
NatWest he didnt apply for the loan, I think it was reasonable NatWest asked Mr and Mrs D 
to review their bank account statements to check whether there had been any transactions 
they didnt authorise. And, due to the car garage using their previous trading name, the 
£6,500 card payment wasnt recognised by Mr and Mrs D which prompted NatWest to treat it 
as fraudulent. So, although we now know it to be genuine, I think it was appropriate for 
NatWest to consider it as fraudulent at the time. 
The card payment was swiftly refunded by NatWest. As banks often temporarily credit 
disputed transactions while an investigation is carried out, I think it was reasonable NatWest 
did this. Now thats its known the payment is genuine, if they havent already, NatWest may 
look to re-debit the payment from Mr and Mrs Ds bank account. And, although Im not aware of what investigation NatWest carried out in respect of this disputed payment, I dont 
consider it materially relevant when determining whether Mr D is liable for the loan  as it 
seems to be an unrelated genuine transaction.  
For the above reasons, Im not persuaded the loan was applied for fraudulently. I also 
consider it highly improbable the loan was set up due to an internal error on NatWests part  
and Ive not seen anything to suggest thats happened here. Instead, on balance, I think its 
most likely Mr D applied for the loan given it repaid an existing loan and hes had use of the 
funds. 
Im aware Mr D has also raised concerns about his online banking access being restricted 
and that he hasnt received information  such as proof the loan was taken out  despite 
various requests made to NatWest. The online banking was initially restricted by NatWest 
due to security concerns because of the alleged fraud. I think this was reasonable in the 
circumstances as a way of preventing further potential losses. Following this, Mr D stopped 
making the loan repayments and his account was referred to debt recovery as it was in 
arrears. At this point, as per NatWests policy, Mr Ds online banking access remained 
restricted. I realise Mr Ds dissatisfaction at not being able to use online banking but I dont 
think NatWest acted inappropriately  or treated Mr D unfairly  by restricting his access. 
Mr D says he hasnt received information from NatWest regarding the loan and hes 
questioned what information the Financial Ombudsman has received. Its unclear what 
specific information Mr D has asked NatWest for but, Im satisfied the loan was set up and 
NatWest sent details of it to Mr D via his online banking account at the time (as thats how it 
was applied for). Ive attached a copy of the loan acceptance letter sent to Mr D for his 
records. The Financial Ombudsman has also received bank statements showing the loan 
funds being paid into Mr Ds account  that weve provided Mr D copies of  and some of 
their internal records relating to the loan. If Mr D is unhappy with how NatWest is handling 
his personal data, then he may wish to contact the Information Commissioners Office. 
I know this isnt the outcome Mr D is hoping for but, for the above reasons, I think NatWest 
has acted fairly by holding him liable for the loan
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2023.
