The complaint
Mr S complains that FirstRand Bank Limited, trading as MotoNovo Finance, wouldnt allow 
him to have a payment holiday on his hire purchase agreement.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr S under a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo Finance 
that he electronically signed in October 2017. He agreed to make: 53 monthly payments of 
£398.47 starting 2 months after execution of the documents followed by 1 monthly payment 
of £557.47.
He contacted MotoNovo in August 2019 and asked it for a payment holiday so that he could 
go on holiday and he then complained to it. MotoNovo Finance said that it doesnt offer 
payment holidays and that the two month period before the first payment under the 
agreement wasnt a payment holiday. Mr S wasnt satisfied with its response so complained 
to this service.
Our investigator recommended that this complaint should be upheld in part. He said that he 
was unable to conclude that a payment holiday option was available for Mr S but he said that 
the comments in MotoNovo Finances final response letter to Mr S could be perceived 
negatively and had caused him inconvenience. He recommended that it should pay him £50 
for that inconvenience.
MotoNovo Finance has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. It says, 
in summary, that Mr S has never raised a complaint with it regarding the handling of his 
complaint.
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr S 
and to MotoNovo Finance on 8 February 2021. In my provisional decision I said as follows:
Mr S had agreed to make the monthly payments referred to above for the car. He 
asked MotoNovo Finance for a payment holiday in August 2019 so that he could pay 
for a holiday. The agreement did not allow him to take a payment holiday and I dont 
consider that there was any requirement in these circumstances for MotoNovo 
Finance to allow Mr S not to make the required payments. 
A credit provider is required to respond to a customers financial difficulties positively 
and sympathetically. That doesnt mean that its obliged to offer a payment holiday, 
or to take any other particular action, as whats appropriate in each case will depend 
on the customers individual circumstances. But Im not persuaded from the evidence 
that Ive seen that Mr S was experiencing financial difficulties when he contacted 
MotoNovo Finance about the payment holiday.
For these reasons, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
MotoNovo Finance acted incorrectly in declining Mr Ss request for a payment 
holiday.
Mr S has complained about the customer service that hes received from MotoNovo 
Finance and about the comments that it made in its final response letter. Ive read 
that letter and I dont consider that the comments that MotoNovo Finance has made 
in it fall below the standard of customer service that I would reasonably expect it to 
provide and I dont consider that they would be enough to justify an award of 
compensation to Mr S. 
So I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require MotoNovo Finance to take any action in response to Mr Ss complaint.
So, subject to any further representations by Mr S or MotoNovo Finance, my provisional 
decision was that I wasnt minded to uphold this complaint.
Mr S and MotoNovo Finance have both accepted my provisional decision, but Mr S has 
referred to the mental health issues that hes suffered.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I sympathise with Mr S for the mental health issues to which hes referred but as both he and 
MotoNovo Finance have accepted my provisional decision, I see no reason to change that 
decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 March 2021.
