The complaint
X and Mrs D complain about the way Aviva Insurance Limited handled a claim against their 
home emergency insurance policy. 
Reference to Aviva include their agents. 
What happened
The background to the complaint is known to all parties so I wont repeat it here. In my 
decision Ill mainly focus on giving the reasons for reaching the outcome I have. 
X and Mrs D reported a leak from a radiator to Aviva in November 2021. Mr D says he had 
isolated the leak and used towels to stem the flow of water. He says Aviva were only able to 
send an engineer to their property the following day which he thought was unacceptable. 
Mr D says the policy is a home emergency policy, and the appointment for the following day 
given to him by Aviva wasnt acceptable. They complained the policy was mis-sold and 
thought Aviva should refund the premiums. 
Aviva say Mr D reported hed isolated the leak so no further damage was being caused. And 
although isolating the leak meant Mr D and Mrs D would have no access to mains water, 
they say they offered the next available appointment which was the following day. They 
thought this was reasonable, and the policy didnt promise an emergency service. 
Mr D and Mrs D remained unhappy and approached our service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend it be upheld. He considered the policy terms and didnt 
think Aviva offered an appointment within an unreasonable timeframe based on these, and 
what Mr D reported. Mr D and Mrs D remained unhappy and approached our service. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My final decision
