The complaint
Mr R complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with 
Blue Motor Finance Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality. His wife is also involved with his 
complaint.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr R under a hire purchase agreement with Blue Motor 
Finance that he electronically signed in March 2019;
Blue Motor Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory quality 
will depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the car and the 
price that was paid for it;
the agreement shows that the car that was supplied to Mr R was nearly five years 
old, had been driven for 63,000 miles and had a price of £7,530;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car had passed an MOT test with no advisories in March 2019, before the car 
was supplied to Mr R, and its mileage was recorded as 63,384;
Mr R paid £441.44 for the front brake discs and pads to be renewed and a tyre to be 
replaced in May 2019 when the cars mileage was 66,163 and, later that month, he 
paid £137.99 for another tyre to be replaced when the cars mileage was 67,864; 
he says that he then noticed oil leaking from the car so he complained to Blue Motor 
Finance in June 2019 about the issues that hed had with the car and he arranged for 
the oil leak to be repaired under the cars warranty - but he had to pay £72 for items 
that werent included under the warranty;
Blue Motor Finance arranged for the car to be inspected by an independent expert in 
August 2019 when its mileage was recorded as 72,115  the experts report 
concludes: 
Based on the vehicles MOT history the vehicle passed an MOT in and 
around the date of sale with a similar mileage. This leads us to the conclusion 
that the vehicle was roadworthy and fit for purpose for a vehicle its age and 
reported mileage at the date of sale.
the warranty repair hadnt remedied the oil leak so Mr R took it to a different garage 
for further work in September 2019 and he paid £549.67 for that work but the car 
continued to leak oil so the garage repaired it again in October 2019 and he paid it 
£1,125;
that repair did remedy the fault and the car passed an MOT test in March 2020 when 
its mileage was recorded as 83,604 but, as Blue Motor Finance wouldnt reimburse 
him for the repair costs that hed incurred, he arranged in May 2020 for an 
independent expert to write a report on his issues with the car - the report, which 
contains a detailed explanation of the events, concludes:
I am satisfied that on the balance of probabilities, for those reasons 
mentioned above, that the engine main rear oil seal had failed/started to fail 
prior to purchase, technically making the vehicle unsuitable for purpose;
but it then says that the warranty company accepted replacement of the seal under 
the terms of its agreement but the repairs werent carried out correctly so the 
additional costs that Mr R had incurred in rectifying the issues should be recovered 
from the warranty company;
the car had passed an MOT test in March 2019 so I consider that its more likely than 
not that it was in a roadworthy condition at that time  and Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to support Mr Rs claim that the MOT test was incorrect or 
fraudulent;
Mr R was then able to use the car to drive more than 2,700 miles in about six weeks 
before he paid for the brake discs and pads and a tyre to be replaced  Im not 
persuaded that its likely that hed have been able to do so if the tyres and brakes 
hadnt been in a roadworthy condition when the car was supplied to him  he would 
also have had the opportunity to inspect the car before it was supplied to him and I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have checked the tyres;
the two independent experts who have provided evidence have given inconsistent 
opinions  which Ive quoted above  but its my understanding that Mr R was able to 
use the car to drive about 4,600 miles in eleven weeks before the oil leak was 
noticed;
the car had passed an MOT test in March 2019, Mr R had taken it to garages twice in 
May 2019 for the brake and tyre issues and hed used the car for about eleven weeks 
before he noticed the oil leak  so I dont consider it to be likely that that the oil leak 
was present when the car was supplied to him and I consider it to be reasonable to 
expect that the leak would have been noticed earlier than it was if it had been present 
since then;
the warranty which paid for the June 2019 repair was provided by the warranty 
company and Im not persuaded that Blue Motor Finance is liable for any failure of 
the garage to properly repair the oil leak at that time;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the car wasnt of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr R; and 
I sympathise with Mr R for the issues that hes had with the car and the repair and 
other costs that hes incurred but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Blue Motor Finance to reimburse Mr R for those 
costs, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2020.
