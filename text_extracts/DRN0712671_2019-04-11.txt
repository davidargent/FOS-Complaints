K820x#14complaint
Mrs E says The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) mis-sold Royalties and Royalties  Gold  
packaged bank  accounts to her. Shes used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to 
complain. 
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mrs Es complaint  and as Mrs E had not actually paid an account  
fee for these accounts he did not think that they were mis-sold. The CMC disagreed  and 
asked for an ombudsmans review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mrs Es complaint.  Having done  so, I dont think Mrs E has suffered  a loss, 
even if RBS had mis-sold  the packaged accounts to her. Id like to explain why I think thats 
the case. 
We have explained  to Mrs Es representative  that Mrs E has not paid any account fees for 
either of these accounts. And having checked  her bank statements, I am satisfied that is the 
case. 
I am a little surprised that the CMC,  who purports itself to be a professional complaint 
representative, has asked  for a final decision  on this case  and has provided no argument for 
why they disagree  with the adjudicators assessment. 
Despite this, I have  reviewed this complaint and I am satisfied  that Mrs E has never paid a 
fee for either  the Royalties  or Royalties Gold account. So I dont think that RBS selling Mrs E 
these account  caused her a loss or that RBS needs to do anything.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold Mrs Es complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 May 2019.
