The complaint
Mr W says CarCashPoint Limited lent to him irresponsibly.  
What happened
Mr W borrowed £850 from CarCashPoint on 23 December 2014. The loan had a 156-week
term, the weekly repayments were £25.07 and the total repayable was £3910.93. As Mr W
was unable to make his repayments his car was repossessed in December 2015. 
CarCashPoint sold it for £2050.82 in February 2016 and wrote off the remaining outstanding
balance.
The loan was a log book loan. It was given on the basis that Mr W provided CarCashPoint
with a bill of sale for his car. This meant that if Mr W didnt make his loan repayments,
CarCashPoint could potentially recover its losses through the sale of the car  as happened.
Mr W says CarCashPoint lent to him when he already had financial difficulties and was
gambling. He was using two bank accounts and making large transfers between them but
this wasnt questioned, CarCashPoint only wanted to check his income.
The adjudicator didnt recommend Mr Ws complaint should be upheld. She said the lenders
checks werent proportionate, but she didnt think if it had completed better checks
CarCashPoint ought to have made a different lending decision. Mr W disagreed saying
checking his credit file would have showed hed defaulted on multiple accounts.
As agreement could not be reached the complaint was passed to me to make a decision. I 
reached a different conclusion to the adjudicator and so issued a provisional decision (an 
extract follows and forms part of this final decision) to give both parties a chance to submit 
any final comments or new information. I asked for their responses by 9 August 2021.
Extract from my provisional decision
CarCashPoint asked for some information from Mr W before it approved the loan. It asked
for details of his income (and checked this against recent bank statements), living expenses
and about any credit cards or loans he was repaying. It added a buffer of £200 to the
expenses he declared. And it checked he hadnt been declared bankrupt. From these
checks combined CarCashPoint concluded that Mr W had £395 of disposable income and
so the loan was affordable.
Like our adjudicator I dont think these checks were proportionate given the term of the loan
and the fact it was secured against Mr Ws car. However I wont comment further on this as
even based on the checks it carried out I dont think CarCashPoint made a fair lending
decision.
Whilst CarCashPoint has explained how it verified Mr Ws income, I cant see it did the same
for his expenditure. It had the information it needed in Mr Ws bank statements but it doesnt
seem that it fully considered Mr Ws expenditure. Had it done so it would have seen that
Mr Ws financial position was not as it assumed. He was having problems managing his
money, spending a significant amount of his monthly income on gambling in each of the
three months prior to this loan application. I note the adjudicator pointed to just two or three
gambling transactions the day before the loan was approved but this is inaccurate. My
analysis of the bank statements Mr W provided to the lender shows he was spending
hundreds of pounds each month  and in excess of his income in the month before he
applied for this loan.
CarCashPoint should also have noticed Mr W was regularly transferring money to a second
account and looked to understand this. Mr W has supplied this service with statements for
this second account which show further gambling transactions. So I disagree with
CarCashPoints comment in its final response letter that Mr Ws bank statements showed his
finances were in good order.
I think CarCashPoint ought to have realised from the data it had gathered that Mr Ws
finances were not stable and that there was a high risk he wouldnt be able to sustainably
repay this loan. So I think CarCashPoint, as a responsible lender, ought to have made a
different lending decision. It follows I currently think Mr W has lost out because of what
CarCashPoint did wrong.
I havent seen any evidence that CarCashPoint acted unfairly or unreasonably in any other
way.
I went on to set out what the lender would need to do if I upheld the complaint.
Both parties responded to the provisional decision before the deadline.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 Our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending, including all the relevant 
rules, guidance and good industry practice, is set out on our website and I have followed it 
here.
In response to my provisional decision Mr W said he thought it was fair and he had nothing 
further to add. CarCashPoint said it accepted the outcome.
As neither party sent in any comments or new evidence, I have no reason to change the 
findings I set out or the conclusion I reached. It follows I am upholding Mr Ws complaint.
Putting things right
CarCashPoint must put Mr W back in the position he would be in had it not made an 
irresponsible lending decision. This means Mr W should have repaid no more than the 
capital he borrowed and he should not have lost his vehicle.
CarCashPoint has confirmed that it sold the car for £2050.82. To work out the fair way to put
things right I need to understand the market value of the car. To do this I have relied on a
standard industry price guide that is used for valuing vehicles (CAP) and assumed the car
was in average condition. Ive done this based on the vehicle inspection report completed
when the car was collected in December 2015 that the lender has provided. I have taken into
account the mileage at the date of sale. On this basis I am estimating the market value to
have been £3275.So CarCashPoint should:
- add up the total amount Mr W repaid and deduct this sum from the capital amount of
the loan
- if this results in Mr W having paid more than he received the overpayments
should be refunded along with 8% simple interest* (calculated from date of the
overpayments until the date of settlement)
- if a capital balance remains outstanding the lender should try to arrange an affordable
repayment plan with Mr W, ensuring any fees associated with the repossession are not
included in this balance
- refund £3275 to Mr W to reflect the estimated market value of his vehicle that he had
to surrender to repay in part a loan he shouldnt have been given
- remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ws credit file in respect of the loan
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to deduct tax from this interest. CarCashPoint
should give Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
I am upholding Mr Ws complaint and CarCashPoint Limited must put things right as set out 
above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 September 2021.
