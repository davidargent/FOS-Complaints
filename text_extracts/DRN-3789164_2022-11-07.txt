The complaint
Mr G complains about arrears information recorded on his credit file by NewDay Ltd. 
What happened
Mr G opened a credit card with NewDay in March 2018. Mr G later experienced some 
financial difficulties and fell into arrears. Mr G went on to arrange a Debt Management Plan 
(DMP) via a third party organisation. 
In 2021 Mr G complained that, unlike other creditors, NewDay had failed to close his credit 
card and record a default. Mr G went on to refer his complaint to this service and it was 
reviewed by an investigator. They asked NewDay to backdate the default to September 
2019, six months after Mr Gs account first fell into arrears. NewDay agreed and Mr G 
accepted so his complaint was closed. 
We received further contact from Mr G after he looked at his credit file. Mr G said that one of 
the credit reference agencies was incorrectly recording payments from 2017, including 
arrears. Mr G pointed out the monthly payment markers and arrears predated the point his 
account was opened with NewDay. 
An investigator at this service upheld Mr Gs complaint and asked NewDay to remove the 
incorrect information recorded and pay him £50. NewDay has repeatedly told us its 
recording accurate information on Mr Gs credit file. NewDay didnt accept the investigators 
view. As a result, Mr Gs complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NewDay has confirmed Mr G opened his credit card in March 2018. And thats reflected by 
the start date recorded on Mr Gs credit file. But one of the credit reference agencies 
contains too many monthly payments for an account that was only open for around 18 
months. NewDay forwarded a copy of the information it reports. Ive copied the relevant 
section below: 
The credit file information correctly shows the account start date and default date. But, the 
lowest row sets out the payment profile. It shows in excess of 40 monthly payments. And it 
shows a period of 31 months when the account was in arrears. But Mr Gs credit card was 
only opened in March 2018 and NewDay agreed to reflect it as closed from September 2019 
 18 months. I agree with Mr G and the investigator that the number of arrears recorded is 
inaccurate and should be corrected. 
In order to resolve Mr Gs complaint, NewDay will need to ensure it only reports payments 
for an 18 month period from March 2018 until September 2019. All payments reported 
before March 2018 will need to be removed from Mr Gs credit report. 
Im aware NewDays case handler recently asked for an extension. But the investigators 
have been making the same points since March 2022 and Im satisfied NewDays had fair 
chance to respond. 
I can see this issue has caused some inconvenience to Mr G, so Im also going to tell 
NewDay to pay him £50 to reflect that. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Gs complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to accurately report his 
payment profile, removing all payments reported on his credit file prior to March 2018 and 
after September 2019. NewDay Ltd should also pay Mr G £50 for the distress and 
inconvenience caused
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 December 2022.
