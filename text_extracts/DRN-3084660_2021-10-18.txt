The complaint
Mr H complains about problems he experienced after setting up a PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCA (PayPal) account using the wrong name.  
What happened
Mr H has explained he set up a PayPal account so he and colleagues could arrange 
collections during the pandemic. Mr H set up his account with an administrative user name, 
not his personal name. 
Mr H talked to PayPal via its chat facility over the course of around three weeks in October 
2020 and asked for help to change the account name. Mr H was given various pieces of 
advice, including being told to amend the account type from personal to business. Mr H also 
submitted identification documents to PayPal. 
Ultimately PayPal permanently locked the account and told Mr H it would release the funds it 
held after 180 days passed. The funds were released to Mr H in April 2021. 
Mr H referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They agreed 
with PayPal that Mr H had opened the account in the wrong name and not in line with the 
terms. But they thought PayPal had failed to provide reasonable assistance to Mr H when he 
asked for help. The investigator recommended PayPal pay Mr H £150 to recognise the 
trouble and upset caused. They also asked PayPal to close the account and remove the 
funding account information. 
PayPal asked to appeal and repeated that Mr H set up the PayPal account using the wrong 
personal information which wasnt in accordance with its user agreement. As PayPal didnt 
accept the investigators view, Mr Hs complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive set out the background to this complaint in far less detail than the investigator as all 
parties broadly agree about the overall timeline. And all parties appear to agree that Mr H 
made a mistake when he used an administrative user name when setting up his PayPal 
account. Ive looked at the user agreement, and I agree with PayPal that the account 
shouldve been set up using his legal name. 
That being said, we all make mistakes and Im satisfied Mr Hs error was genuine. So whilst I 
agree PayPal acted reasonably when it took the decision to limit Mr Hs access to the funds 
it held, it still needed to treat him fairly. 
Ive read all the chat logs provided as well as the correspondence submitted by both parties. 
Having read the chat logs, I can understand why Mr H was upset and frustrated at the 
information provided. Contrary advice was provided by different representatives and I felt the 
responses and information Mr H received was somewhat chaotic. Whilst I dont agree 
PayPal made a mistake by restricting access to the funds for 180, I think it shouldve been 
clearer when providing information to Mr H. 
I agree with the investigator that the way Mr Hs enquiries were handled caused an 
unnecessary level of frustration and inconvenience. The investigator has recommended 
PayPal settle by paying Mr H £150 and I agree thats a fair approach. In my view, £150 fairly 
reflects the impact of this situation on Mr H. 
Our investigator also asked PayPal to close the account and remove Mr Hs bank details. In 
its response, PayPal has explained the account in question is already permanently disabled 
on its systems. In addition, PayPal has confirmed Mr H can set up a new account if he 
wishes, using the same bank details. Im pleased PayPal has a process should Mr H wish to 
open a new account in the future. PayPal hasnt given any reasons why it cant delete the 
existing bank details and I understand thats of particular concern to Mr H. So Im also going 
to tell PayPal to delete Mr Hs bank details from the permanently locked account.   
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to pay 
Mr H £150.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2021.
