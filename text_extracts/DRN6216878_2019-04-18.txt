K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) have downgraded his 
current account to a basic account.  To put things right he wants  them to reinstate his current  
account.
background
In January 2019 NatWest sent Mr M a new debit card and a letter  telling him that his current  
account had been downgraded to a basic account. 
When he queried this NatWest said theyd done  so because theyd received a report  from 
the insolvency service  informing them that hed entered  a Debt Relief  Order (DRO). But the 
insolvency service disputed that they had sent anything to NatWest, so Mr M asked for a 
copy of the letter. Mr M chased NatWest  a number of times for this. And he didnt receive  a 
call back that was promised. His calls were  also disconnected on a number of occasions, 
and Mr M wasnt  connected to speak to a manager when he asked. 
NatWest agreed that Mr M hadnt received the service he should expect from them,  and paid 
him a total of £150 compensation for this. But they stood  by their decision to downgrade his 
account. So Mr M brought his complaint to our service.
Our investigator didnt  think that the complaint should be upheld.  He said it was NatWests 
commercial decision to decide what facilities they wish to offer their customers. And he was 
satisfied theyd followed their usual process when  theyd  downgraded Mr Ms account.
Mr M still feels that NatWest acted unfairly  because they told him that theyd received a 
report from the insolvency service,  and this wasnt true. And they hadnt  shown him any 
evidence they were aware of his DRO before they downgraded his account.  So the case has 
been passed to me to review.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I know  Mr M will be disappointed, but I 
wont be asking NatWest  to take any further  action here. Ill explain why.
Mr M has a DRO which was approved  in January  2019. But, as he does not have  any debt 
with NatWest, he feels its unfair that they have downgraded his account  because of this. 
Hes explained that its very inconvenient for him as he is no longer able to use his debit card 
to make contactless payments. 
I understand why this is frustrating for Mr M. But Im afraid I agree with our investigator that 
NatWest were entitled to downgrade  his account. Their personal  banking terms and 
conditions explain that they can change a current account to another  account in their range if 
they have a valid reason. They also say that they can close an account that isnt a basic  
account if a customer  has entered a voluntary arrangement with creditors  to repay their 
debts. And I think its fair to say that a DRO is of a similar nature. 
Ref: DRN62168782NatWest have also shown  us evidence that they followed their standard process  for 
customers with a DRO here. Including customers with a DRO who do not have a debt with 
NatWest. And its not my role to tell NatWest what their process should be. So whilst I 
appreciate Mr M will be disappointed, I cant see that they have acted unfairly or 
unreasonably towards  him.
Mr M wants to have  a contactless debit  card.  But NatWest have explained that they dont 
offer these  with their basic account. Again, this is a decision that NatWest  are entitled to 
make about  the services  they wish to provide with an account. So whilst I understand this is 
inconvenient for Mr M, I cant  reasonably ask NatWest  to issue  him with a contactless  card.  
I appreciate that NatWest  initially told Mr M that they had taken  this action following receipt  
of a report from the insolvency service. Ive seen evidence that the insolvency  service say 
they did not contact  NatWest directly. But they did explain  to Mr M that his DRO appears  on 
the public  Individual Insolvency  Register. And NatWest have since confirmed to our service 
that they do check this register  periodically.  And this is how they became aware of Mr Ms 
situation. 
I appreciate Mr M doubts this is true, as the only evidence NatWest  have  provided  him about 
their knowledge  of his DRO is dated 14 February  2019, after they had already downgraded 
his account. But it is common  practice  for banks to check  the Individual Insolvency  Register.  
And I can see that the DRO is dated  9 January 2019, before NatWest  downgraded Mr Ms 
account. So I dont  think there is any evidence that they did anything wrong here.
I can see Mr M spent  a lot of time chasing NatWest  because  they gave him incorrect 
information about receiving this report directly  from the insolvency service.  And hes 
described the experience he had when doing so. I agree that he did not receive the level of 
service he should  expect from NatWest here. But I think that the £150 compensation 
NatWest have paid him is reasonable  in the circumstances.  So I wont be asking them  to do 
any further.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 April 2019.
