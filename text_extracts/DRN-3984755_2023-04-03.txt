The complaint
Mr C complains about a sum of money Moneybarn No. 1 Limited (Moneybarn) is seeking 
the recovery of after he decided to voluntary terminate his conditional sale agreement 
(agreement) with it. 
What happened
In April 2021 Mr C entered into an agreement with Moneybarn for the purchase of a used car 
costing £17,450.00. Under the terms of the agreement, everything else being equal, Mr C 
undertook to make an advance payment of £4,000 followed by 59 monthly payments of 
£472.26 making a total sum repayable of £31,863.34 at an APR of 39.9%.
Between May and August 2021 inclusive Mr C should have paid Moneybarn £1,889.04 
(4 monthly payments of £472.26). Instead, Mr C paid Moneybarn £130.00 putting him in an 
arrears position (as of August 2021) of £1,759.04.
In July 2021 Mr C called Moneybarn to discuss exiting the agreement. Moneybarn explained 
to Mr C that he had three options, voluntary termination of the agreement, voluntary 
surrender of the car and settlement of the agreement.
In August 2021 Mr C took the decision to voluntary terminate his agreement. After doing so 
Moneybarn sent him an invoice for £11,801.67. This was broken down as follows:
50% of the total sum repayable under the agreement £15,931.67
advance payment made (£4,000.00)
other payments made (£130.00)
total repayable £11,801.67
In March 2022 Mr C complained to Moneybarn about the sum it was seeking the recovery of 
from him.
In April 2022 Moneybarn issued Mr C with a final response letter (FRL). Under cover of this 
FRL Moneybarn said it stood by the sum it was seeking the recovery of from Mr C which, 
following a payment of £70.49 made by Mr C in January 2022, stood at £11,731.18 
(£11,801.67 less £70.49).
In March 2022 Mr C offered Moneybarn, via a third party debt charity, £5.00 a month against 
the debt of £11,731.18.
 
In May 2022, and unhappy with Moneybarns FRL, Mr C complained to our service.
Mr Cs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who concluded that Mr Cs 
complaint should be upheld, at least in part. In summary he said Moneybarn, because of 
misleading information it gave Mr C in July 2021 about his three exit options, should 
recalculate the sum due and owing from him as if he had voluntary surrendered the car 
rather than voluntary terminated the agreement. 
He also said that Moneybarn should amend what it had recorded with one or more third 
party credit reference agencies to reflect voluntary surrender of the car rather than voluntary 
termination of the agreement and to pay Mr C £100.00 for the distress and inconvenience its 
management and administration of the agreement had caused.
Moneybarn accepted the investigators conclusion and explained that had it treated the car 
as being voluntary surrendered, rather than the agreement being voluntary terminated, then 
the sum due and owing from Mr C (in August 2021) would have been £9,233.34 calculated 
as follows:
100% of the total sum repayable under the agreement £31,863.34
advance payment made (£4,000.00)
other payments made (£130.00)
proceeds from sale of car at auction (£18,500.00)
total repayable £9,233.34
rather than £11,801.67.
On receipt of the above calculation from Moneybarn the investigator considered Mr Cs 
complaint afresh. And after doing so he came to the conclusion that it would be fairer for 
Moneybarn to:
write off the sum outstanding under the agreement
retain the proceeds from the sale of the car
retain the payments made by Mr C under the agreement up to and including 
August 2021
refund to Mr C any payments he had made under the agreement after August 2021
pay Mr C 8% simple yearly interest on the above refunds from the date each 
payment was made to the date of settlement
pay Mr C £100 for the distress and inconvenience its management and 
administration of the agreement has caused
ensure the agreement status recorded with third party credit reference agencies 
shows it as settled with nothing owing (backdated to August 2021)
The investigator concluded the above to be and fair reasonable because had Moneybarn 
been clearer in explaining the three exit options to Mr C (in July 2021) then on balance Mr C 
would have sold the car himself and settled the agreement in full, with nothing further to pay. 
He also concluded the above to be fair and reasonable because it allowed Moneybarn a 
gross return under the agreement of £5,180.00 (£18,500.00 sale proceeds, plus £130.00 
paid by Mr C less £13,450.00 capital sum originally advanced) and a net return of £3,669.15 
(£18,500.00 sale proceeds, plus £130.00 paid by Mr C less £13,450.00 capital sum originally 
advanced less interest for the period April to August 2021 of £1,510.85).
Moneybarn didnt accept the investigators second view, so Mr Cs complaint has been 
passed to me for review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Having done so I can confirm that Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator 
ultimately did and for the same reasons. There is also very little I can usefully add to what 
has already been said.
When Mr C called Moneybarn in July 2021 he had been in possession of the car for only a 
few months and was already in substantial arrears. Furthermore, Mr C made it clear in this 
call that due to a change in his personal circumstances he was in severe financial difficulties, 
in discussion with a third party debt charity and speaking to his GP about his mental health.
So, in my view, Moneybarn should have taken extra care when discussing with Mr C his 
various exit options because it should have been clear to it that choosing the right option 
would have been very important to Mr C.
Now I accept that it wasnt for Moneybarn to advise Mr C as to what option he should take. I 
also accept that Moneybarn wouldnt have known the exact amount Mr C would owe it if he 
voluntary surrendered the car, or what he would owe it (if anything) if he sold the car himself 
and settled the agreement due to the uncertainty over the cars sale price (whether at 
auction or sold privately).
But I think that given the very short period of time Mr C had been in possession of the car, 
the miles he had added to the odometer, the substantial advance payment Mr C had made 
and what was happening to second-hand car prices Moneybarn could and should have done 
more to explain the advantages of selling the car privately (himself) and settling the 
agreement with the proceeds. I certainly dont think it should have agreed with Mr C when he 
said voluntary termination is the best and cheapest option then.
In my view had Moneybarn explained more clearly the three exit options available to Mr C he 
would have elected to sell the car privately and to settle the agreement with nothing further 
payable under it. And I think this is the position Moneybarn should now place Mr C in by 
writing off the sum recorded in its books as being outstanding and due under the agreement 
and by refunding him all the payments he made (together with interest) after August 2021.
For the sake of completeness, I would add that I accept that by signing the agreement Mr C 
undertook not to sell or make any attempt to sell the [car] before [he had] made all the 
payments required under [it]. But given the circumstances Mr C found himself in (which he 
openly shared with Moneybarn) and Moneybarns various regulatory obligations (which the 
investigator made reference to in his second view) Im satisfied that it would have been 
appropriate, fair and reasonable for Moneybarn to have allowed Mr C to have sold the car 
and to then settle the agreement, rather than the other way round.
I accept that when having regard to what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances I need 
to have regard to not just whats fair to the consumer but whats fair and reasonable to the 
business. But, in this case, Im not persuaded that by finding what I have that Im being 
unfair or unreasonable to Moneybarn. I say this because even after settling this complaint in 
full its my view that Moneybarn will still have returned a profit from its decision to make the 
advance to Mr C that it did. I would also add that by treating the car as being voluntary 
surrendered, or the agreement as being voluntary terminated, results in a disproportionate 
benefit accruing to Moneybarn that is simply unfair and unreasonable.
 
Finally, and like the investigator, I think its only fair that in the particular circumstances of 
this case that Moneybarn pay Mr C £100.00 for the distress and inconvenience its 
management and administration of the agreement has caused him and that it needs to 
amend anything that it has recorded with third party credit reference agencies to show the 
agreement as settled with nothing owing backdated to August 2021.Putting things right
Given what Ive said above, Im satisfied that to fairly and reasonably compensate Mr C 
Moneybarn must:
write off the sum recorded in its books as being outstanding and due under the 
agreement
refund to Mr C any payments he made under the agreement after August 2021
pay Mr C 8% simple yearly interest on the above refunds from the date each 
payment was made to the date of settlement*
pay Mr C £100 for the distress and inconvenience its management and 
administration of the agreement has caused
ensure the agreement status recorded with third party credit reference agencies 
shows it as settled with nothing owing (backdated to August 2021)
*HMRC requires Moneybarn to take off tax from this interest. If Mr C asks for a certificate 
showing how much tax has been taken off this should be provided
My final decision
My final decision is that Moneybarn No. 1 Limited must compensate Mr C in line with what 
Ive said above under the heading Putting things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 May 2023.
