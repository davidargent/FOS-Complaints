K821x#15complaint
Mr and Mrs S complain  that National Westminster Bank Plc failed to process a CHAPS 
payment quickly enough.  The delay meant that Mr and Mrs S couldnt move into their new 
home and had to pay additional removal and hotel costs.
background
Mr S went  in to a branch of NatWest  on 5 September 2018 to make  a CHAPS payment. 
NatWest didnt process the payment  that day as it was close to the cut-off time.
On 6 September 2018 NatWest needed  further  information from Mr S. Mr S didnt realise 
that there  was a message  on his mobile phone and he continued  to contact NatWest for an 
update on progress. Once Mr S become aware  of what further information NatWest  required 
it was near the processing cut-off time.  This meant that NatWest  didnt process  the payment 
until 7 September  2018.
Before this service became involved NatWest offered to pay Mr and Mrs S £55 to apologise.  
Mr and Mrs S dont  think that this is enough.
The adjudicator recommended that Mr and Mrs Ss complaint be upheld.  She asked  the 
bank to pay Mr and Mrs S the additional  storage costs that they incurred  as well as the cost 
of the hotel. The adjudicator also thought  that NatWest should  pay more  compensation than 
the £55 it had previously offered. She asked the bank  to pay a total of £150 compensation. 
NatWest doesnt  agree  with the adjudicators recommendation. It says that Mr S shouldve  
been aware that NatWest was going  to call him back. NatWest  thinks that Mr S shouldve 
been looking  out for the call.
Mr and Mrs S dont  think £150 is enough. They think that NatWest should be paying nearer 
to £1,000. Mr S says that hes banked with NatWest for many years and feels  very let down. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate that Mr and Mrs S want NatWest to pay significantly  more  compensation than 
the adjudicator  recommended. I dont underestimate  the stress  that the delay caused to Mr 
and Mrs S. However, this service isnt the regulator   thats the role of the Financial Conduct 
Authority. So I cant punish NatWest for the failures in customer  service and I cant require 
the bank to pay more simply because Mr S has been a longstanding  customer  of the bank.
I appreciate that NatWest  says it cant guarantee when a CHAPS payment will be processed  
due to the possibility of further checks being necessary. However, Im also mindful of the fact 
that Mr and Mrs S explained why the payment was time sensitive.  And theres a reasonable 
expectation of speed when a customer uses the CHAPS payment system.
Its unfortunate that when Mr S rang NatWest early on 6 September 2018 the member of 
staff wasnt able to tell him what information  the team needed to process the CHAPS  
payment.
Ref: DRN60520722Ive listened to a recording  of the call that Mr S had with NatWest  in the morning of 6 
September 2016. During this call, NatWest explains to Mrs S that someone  will call him back  
that day as part of the compliance process. NatWest cant  be sure what  time that will be. 
And although NatWest  says it understands that the relevant team  will make contact by 
phone, it doesnt specify that the call will be made to Mr Ss mobile.
Although NatWest says that it was reasonable to expect Mr S to keep an eye out for the call 
I cant see any reason why Mr S would  ignore  a call from the bank as he continued to chase 
for updates  for the rest of the day. I wouldve  also reasonably expected NatWest to make  at 
least a second  attempt to contact Mr S before the processing cut-off time approached again. 
I agree  with the adjudicator that its reasonable to require NatWest to pay the additional 
storage and hotel  accommodation costs that Mr and Mrs S incurred because the CHAPS 
payment didnt go through on 6 September 2018.  This is because had NatWest done  more 
to explain what information it needed to Mr and Mrs S earlier  on during the day, it seems  
likely the CHAPS payment wouldve been  processed in time to allow  the house purchase  to 
complete thereby avoiding the additional costs.
The adjudicator recommended that NatWest pay Mr and Mrs S £702 for the re-delivery 
costs. Ive noted that this doesnt  include the VAT element  which the company charged on 
top. I calculate this to be £140.40 making  the total re-delivery costs to be £842.40. 
If Mr and Mrs S accept  my final decision they will be put back in the same financial position  
that they wouldve been had there  been  no delay. Although I dont underestimate the stress 
that the delay  placed  upon Mr and Mrs S, I also take account  of the fact that they were still 
able to move  in a day later and NatWest cant guarantee a time by which  a CHAPS payment 
will be processed. So the delay while inconvenient wasnt long lasting enough to justify an 
increased compensation payment. 
In the circumstances, I think the adjudicators  recommendation to pay Mr and Mrs S £150 in 
addition to the re-delivery and hotel costs is fair and reasonable. For the avoidance of doubt,  
the compensation payment of £150  includes NatWests offer to pay £55.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement I direct National 
Westminster Bank Plc to pay Mr and Mrs S the following:
£842.40 in respect  of additional removal costs;
£86.33 hotel costs; and
£150 compensation
Ref: DRN60520723Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs S to 
accept or reject my decision  before  11 May 2019.
