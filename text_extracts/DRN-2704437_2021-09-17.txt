The complaint
P  a shop owned by a partnership  complains about how WorldPay (UK) Limited have 
treated them, after a debt was created from a chargeback.
Throughout this complaint, P has been represented by one of the partners in the shop, 
Miss P. So, for ease Ill just refer to Miss P.
What happened
In late summer 2018, P processed two card transactions from a customer over the 
telephone. As the card holder wasnt in the shop at the time of the transactions, WorldPay 
classed the payment as card holder not present (CNP). 
A few months later the card holder raised a chargeback with their bank. They said that the 
card had been stolen and used fraudulently to buy goods from P. Because the transactions 
were completed over the telephone and confirmed as fraudulent, WorldPay told Miss P they 
were unable to defend the chargeback enquiry. As well as loosing the goods, P suffered the 
loss of the funds, which were refunded back to the card holder. This created a debt on Ps 
account with WorldPay.
Miss P says she was unable to repay the debt with WorldPay in one lump sum. Instead, she 
reached an agreement, where shed repay £100 a month to WorldPay, until the debt was 
completely repaid.
The repayments to the debt continued until September 2019, when Miss P says she wasnt 
able to continue making them. WorldPay and Miss P continued to talk about the account 
over the next few months. And in spring 2020, Miss P offered to make an increased payment 
of £200, to try and bring the repayment plan up to date.
WorldPay say they were unable to accept any payment from Miss P, without checking she 
could afford to do so. Miss P says she made several attempts to send WorldPay her income 
and expenditure information by email. She also says it was at this point she was dealing with 
very poor health, where she spent time in hospital.
Because the debt was still unpaid, WorldPay continued to send notices of arrears to P and 
spoke with Miss P over the telephone. Miss P says she found this very distressing and that 
she was trying to make a new repayment plan, by sending the relevant information to 
WorldPay. Miss P says she complained to WorldPay, because she didnt think they were 
treating her fairly.
In their response to Miss Ps complaint, WorldPay acknowledged that one of the telephone 
calls about the arrears, could have gone better. They agreed to reduce Ps debt by £100 and 
to reach a new repayment arrangement with Miss P. 
Over the next few months, Miss P tried again to send WorldPay her income and expenditure 
details, but says they wouldnt acknowledge they had received it. So, Miss P referred her 
complaint to us.
One of our investigators looked into Miss Ps complaint and concluded that WorldPay had 
handled the chargeback claim fairly. She also found that WorldPay had received Miss Ps 
income and expenditure details, but hadnt told her they were incomplete. 
Although the investigator found that WorldPay were correct to make sure she could afford a 
repayment plan, she thought they could have sorted things out sooner. She concluded 
WorldPay should pay Miss P a further £100 for the distress and inconvenience they had 
caused and engage with her, to arrange a new repayment plan.
WorldPay agreed with the investigators conclusions, but Miss P didnt. She said that 
WorldPay didnt consider her health, had called her constantly and that they should consider 
reducing the debt by more than a further £100.
The investigator didnt change her conclusions and Miss Ps case has now been passed to 
me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The Chargeback
Miss P has a regulated hire agreement with WorldPay for the terminal P uses to process 
card transactions. Ive thought about the hire agreement and Miss Ps merchant services 
agreement, as well as the operating instructions for the terminal itself. The section titled Key 
Features of the merchant services agreement says:
You are liable for each chargeback and these represent a debt immediately payable 
from you to us.
This section goes on to say:
It may not always be possible however for you to dispute Chargebacks successfully, 
even where you have provided goods or services. This is a risk of your business, 
which you accept.
Having carefully considered the merchant services agreement, I think WorldPay fairly 
explained to Miss P, that a chargeback claim against P was possible, even when the goods 
or services have been provided. But Miss P says that WorldPay should have protected P 
against the fraud, which created the debt P now owes. So, Ive thought about that further.
Section 3.2 of the operating instructions for the terminal says:
CNP transactions carry a greater risk of fraud as you're unable to verify the 
purchaser. This can make your business susceptible to both credit card and 
chargeback fraud. If a CNP transaction is confirmed as fraud, the liability falls with 
you.
Miss P has told us that the two transactions were accepted over the telephone, where the 
cardholder wasnt present. I can also see from WorldPays records, that the chargeback 
claim was processed because the cardholder explained that the card had been stolen at the 
time.
I understand that P has suffered a loss, both with the goods they sold and with the value of the two transactions. And I sympathise with Miss P that her business was effected by the 
fraudsters actions, similar to the impact felt by the cardholder themselves. 
Having considered everything, I think the terms of Miss Ps agreement with Worldpay and 
the operating instructions fairly explain that P will be responsible for the value of a 
chargeback claim, where the card wasnt present and the transaction is confirmed as 
fraudulent. So, I think WorldPay treated Miss P fairly when they held P responsible for the 
debt created on the account.
WorldPays engagement with Miss P
Miss P says she found WorldPays contact with her excessive and threatening. So, Ive 
considered the letters WorldPay sent to Miss P, as well as the telephone calls they made to 
her, to talk about the debt.
The records sent to us by Miss P and WorldPay show that regular letters were sent to P, 
summarising the arrears on their account. The letters also explain that if no payment is 
received, WorldPay may look to issue a breach of contract notice. From the evidence we 
have, I can see that from April 2020 until very recently, WorldPay sent around five letters to 
Miss P, which talk about the arrears. 
I can understand why Miss P says she felt extremely worried by the letters from WorldPay. I 
think each letter makes it clear that WorldPay will look to take action to repay the debt owed 
by P. But, I also think the letters invited Miss P to talk about any financial difficulties she was 
experiencing. 
Taking everything into consideration, I dont think the frequency of the letters sent by 
WorldPay to Miss P was excessive. I think each letter offered support with repaying the 
balance of the account, although I accept Miss P would have found them worrying at an 
already difficult time. 
WorldPay have provided recordings of three of the telephone calls they had with Miss P. I 
have listened to the calls and I can hear that it was a very difficult time for Miss P, where she 
discussed her personal and financial circumstances. I agree that the discussions at times 
involved WorldPay asking for a plan to be put in place to repay the debt. But, I dont think 
WorldPay treated Miss P unfairly in how they spoke to her, or the information they were 
asking her for.
In all the circumstances, I think WorldPay were able to pursue the debt owed by P. I think 
WorldPay treated Miss P fairly when they sent her letters explaining about the arrears and in 
the telephone calls they made to Miss P, to talk about the account.
The repayment offer and Miss Ps income and expenditure details
Miss P has told us that she was seriously ill in hospital in early 2020, when WorldPay spoke 
to her about the balance of Ps account. She says that she offered £200 as an interim 
payment, while she continued with her recovery. Miss P also says WorldPay didnt accept 
that payment straight away, instead offering a month of breathing space, after which they 
would call her back to take the payment. 
I can see from WorldPays records that Miss P did offer £200, but that they needed some 
income and expenditure details from her, to make sure she could afford it. When WorldPay 
called Miss P back, after a month, their stance remained the same, in that they said they 
couldnt take a payment without Miss Ps financial details.I agree that WorldPay may have caused some confusion here. But, I think they treated 
Miss P reasonably, by wanting to make sure she was able to make the payment she was 
offering. Particularly at a time, where Miss P had explained that she was experiencing 
personal and financial difficulties. 
Having considered all the evidence, I think WorldPay treated Miss P fairly, by reducing the 
debt on Ps account by £100, to compensate for the confusion.
Turning now to the several attempts by Miss P, to get WorldPay to acknowledge her emails 
containing her income and expenditure details. I can see that WorldPay had all the 
information necessary, to tell Miss P they needed more clarification about some of the 
details, in June 2020 and again in October 2020. 
However, it does not seem that Miss P was told this until after our involvement in February 
2021. By which time Miss P had attempted to submit several other emails containing her 
financial details.
Having considered everything, I agree that WorldPay could have avoided causing Miss P 
further distress and inconvenience, had they responded to the information they felt was 
missing from her financial details. I also acknowledge that Miss P says WorldPay havent 
considered her personal circumstances and health.
Its clear Miss P has found the last two years extremely challenging and difficult, which were 
made worse by the actions of the fraudster. But, I think WorldPay have offered breathing 
space where appropriate and have tried to engage with Miss P to bring about repayment 
plans. So, while I recognise that WorldPay could have reached this point sooner, I think they 
have treated Miss P fairly and reasonably.
That said, I do think WorldPay caused Miss P further distress and inconvenience by not 
being clearer about the information they needed, following her attempts to sort things out. 
So, I think WorldPay should increase the payment theyve already made. WorldPay have 
already paid Miss P £100. In all the circumstances, I think its fair that WorldPay pay P a 
further £100, bringing the total amount to £200, to settle this complaint.
The outstanding balance owed to WorldPay
Ive reviewed the repayments and the statements of Ps account with WorldPay, and I can 
see that interest and charges havent been applied since the chargeback claims were 
successful. So, I dont think WorldPay have increased the balance owed by P, or asked 
them to repay any more than the total of the two transactions carried out by the fraudster.
WorldPay will need to engage further with Miss P, to talk about her income and expenditure 
details, in order to agree an affordable repayment plan. Although I think WorldPay could 
have acted sooner, to clarify Miss Ps financial details, I think its fair for them to continue to 
talk to her about the debt owed on Ps account. 
While I dont think WorldPay have treated Miss P unfairly, when they asked her to repay the 
debt, I acknowledge this finding means P will still have a responsibility to repay it. So, I 
remind WorldPay that they should continue to treat Miss Ps personal circumstances fairly, 
when looking to agree a new repayment plan with her, for the recovery of the debt.
Putting things right
WorldPay (UK) Limited must pay P an additional £100, bringing the total amount theyve 
paid P, to £200. My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint, and I direct WorldPay (UK) Limited to pay P 
an additional £100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask P to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 October 2021.
