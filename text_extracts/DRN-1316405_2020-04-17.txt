DRN-1316405
The complaint
Mr P complains that after he repaid the outstanding balance on his Santander UK Plc credit 
card, a direct debt payment was collected which put his current account into an unarranged 
overdraft. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on setting out the key reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Santander called Mr P and upheld his complaint, promising to provide feedback to 
the person he spoke with on 3 June 2019. 
There was no financial loss as Santander reversed the direct debit payment on 7 
June 2019, the day it was collected, and refunded interest and charges Mr P incurred 
for entering an unarranged overdraft. 
Santander apologised for the trouble and upset caused by this situation. 
The impact of the situation on Mr P was limited. Santander resolved the issue on 7 
June 2019 after a short call from Mr P. Whilst I agree Santander made a mistake I'm 
satisfied its apology, along with the action it took to resolve matters, is a fair and 
reasonable way to resolve this complaint. 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 May 2020.
