The complaint
Mr T says Gain Credit LLC, trading as Lending Stream (Lending Stream), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr T says he had to take additional lending in order to keep up with the loan 
repayments. As a result, he had to enter a debt management plan, and which impacted his 
mental wellbeing.                            
What happened
This complaint is about 19 instalment loans Lending Stream provided to Mr T between July 
2018 and July 2019. Mr Ts borrowing history is as follows:

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ts complaint and thought the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been given as by loan four it looked as though Mr T was having 
problems managing his money and by loan seven, he was becoming persistently reliant on 
this type of lending. 
Lending Stream disagreed with the adjudicator and sought clarification about the affordability 
and sustainability of the borrowing and asked for the complaint to be reviewed by an 
ombudsman, so it has been passed to me for decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Lending Stream needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr T could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Lending Stream should fairly and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These 
factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Lending Stream was required to 
establish whether Mr T could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr T didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to three shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr T had with Lending Stream. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ts complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
When Mr T returned for further borrowing at loan four, he had loans one to three still 
outstanding. So, his monthly repayments increased from £45.60 at loan one to £116.29 at 
loan four. And he was becoming further indebted to Lending Stream. Lending Streams 
product allows its consumers to take more than one loan at a time. And while I accept this 
may offer a consumer the flexibility to manage their money  taking smaller loans rather than 
one larger loan as an example  but it can equally be an indication that someone is having 
problems managing their finances. 
With the exception of August 2018, Mr T had been borrowing every month at loan four which 
could have suggested that he was using the loans to supplement his income or to service his 
current debt, which is one of Mr Ts complaint points, so I think this was likely. And while the 
repayments look affordable on a pounds and pence basis, I note that Mr Ts monthly income 
was relatively modest at this time  £1,100 to £1,200. So, I think there was a real possibility 
that Mr T was juggling his finances to make ends meet. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Lending Streams lending history with Mr T, with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which Lending Stream should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Lending Stream should 
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ts case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
seven. I say this because:
At this point Lending Stream ought to have realised Mr T was not managing to repay 
his loans sustainably. Mr T had taken out seven loans within nine months. So 
Lending Stream ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mr T was having to 
borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loans were leaving in his 
finances and that Mr Ts indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 Mr Ts first loan was for £100 and loan seven was for the same amount.  At this point 
Lending Stream ought to have known that Mr T was not likely borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
 
Mr T was regularly taking more than one loan in any one month and was increasing 
the monthly amounts borrowed  in May 2019 this increased from £150 in the 
previous month to £400. So, Mr Ts borrowing pattern further suggested the loans 
were unsustainable for him and he wasnt using short-term credit as intended. 
 
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Lending Stream. Loan 
19 was taken out 12 months after Mr Ts first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr T 
had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Lending Stream over 
an extended period. Lending Stream has pointed out that Mr T did repay many of the 
loans well before the agreed term date. And while I accept this would have reduced 
the amount of interest Mr T paid, I would question why someone would repay a loan 
early only to come back for further borrowing. Looking at the repayment dates of the 
loans the majority of them are on the 25th of any month which I note is the same as 
Mr Ts employment pay date. This suggests he was treating this lending as pay-day 
loans. 
 
I think that Mr T lost out because Lending Stream continued to provide borrowing from loan 
seven onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
 
the number of loans Mr T borrowed was likely to have had negative implications on 
Mr Ts ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
 
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans four to 19 and Lending 
Stream should put things right.
Putting things right  what Lending Stream needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr T paid on loans four to 19;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
 
remove any negative information about loans four to six from Mr Ts credit file;
 
the number of loans taken from loan seven onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans seven to 19 should be removed 
from Mr Ts credit file.
  HM Revenue & Customs requires Lending Stream to take off tax from this interest. 
Lending Stream must give Mr T a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks 
for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ts complaint. Gain Credit LLC 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2020.
