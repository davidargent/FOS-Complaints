The complaint
Ws representatives are unhappy with how National Westminster Bank Plc has handled its 
accounts, in particular by temporarily suspending access. W is represented in this complaint 
by Mrs C, Ms G and Mr F who are currently the authorised signatories in respect of Ws 
accounts.
What happened
W holds accounts, including a current account, with NatWest.  The mandate for the current 
account includes multiple signatories.
In January 2019 NatWest was notified, by one of the signatories on the current account at 
the time, of a dispute between Ws signatories. As a result, NatWest placed a stop on Ws 
accounts, meaning it could not make payments (although credits could still be received).
Mrs C complained, on behalf of W to NatWest about its actions. She said the person that 
had notified NatWest of the dispute had resigned from W and would be stepping down at the 
end of January 2019. Mrs C was unhappy that NatWest had acted on the instruction of that 
party and had not contacted any of the other signatories to verify details of the dispute.
NatWest said it didnt think it had done anything wrong in acting on the notification of a 
dispute. And it set out what would be required for the account to be reinstated.
The relevant information was provided to NatWest and the accounts were reinstated in 
February 2019. The account mandate was updated to show Mrs C, Ms G and Mr F as the 
people authorised to act on Ws behalf. The individuals previously authorised to do so, 
including the person that had notified NatWest of the dispute, were removed.
NatWest didnt contact Ws representatives to notify them that the accounts had been 
reinstated until March 2019.
Mrs C told NatWest that Ws representatives were still unhappy with what had happened and 
requested a further explanation as to why the account was suspended. NatWest received 
this correspondence but didnt provide a reply.
Unhappy with the service provided by NatWest, Mrs C, Ms G and Mr F asked us to consider 
Ws complaints.
An investigator looked into matters. She felt NatWest had acted correctly by temporarily 
blocking the accounts. She felt this was in line with their terms and conditions and NatWest 
was correct to act when notified of a dispute. And as it was notified by someone who was an 
authorised signatory at the time, she didnt think it had done anything wrong by not 
contacting other signatories before doing this. 
She did think that the service provided by NatWest to W couldve been better. In particular it 
couldve notified Ws representatives sooner that the restriction on the account had been 
lifted. So, she recommended that NatWest pay £100 for the inconvenience caused to W.
NatWest accepted the investigators view. Ws representatives did not as they felt that the 
redress recommended was not sufficient and still felt NatWest was incorrect to act on the 
notification of a dispute it was given. They said they felt NatWest had not acted in Ws 
interests, had been disrespectful to it and its members and that redress should be paid at a 
level that would persuade NatWest to improve its procedures.
As Ws representatives did not agree with the investigators opinion, the complaint has been 
passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The terms and conditions of Ws account explain that NatWest can delay or refuse to act on 
instructions (such as to make transactions) if it is notified of a dispute between the account 
holders. They go on to explain that NatWest can limit or stop access to the account if it 
believes its appropriate to do so to protect the account.
Im satisfied NatWest was notified of a dispute between account holders. Ive been provided 
with a copy of the signature mandate which shows that the person who notified the business 
of the dispute was a party to the current account at the time  authorised to act for W. As a 
result, NatWest stopped access to Ws accounts for all account holders. And Im satisfied the 
reason for doing so was to protect Ws accounts from misuse until this dispute was resolved. 
The representatives of W bringing this complaint have gone into a lot of detail about what 
they believe the motivations were of the party that informed NatWest of the dispute, as well 
as providing details of the dispute itself and highlighting that the person in question was in 
the process of ending their involvement with W. But that is all largely a matter between the 
members and signatories of W and any former members.
What I have to consider is whether NatWest did anything wrong by restricting access to the 
account in the way it did. And based on the fact that the person who notified NatWest of a 
dispute was still named on the account mandate at the time of the notification, I dont think 
NatWest made a mistake by temporarily suspending access to Ws accounts until the 
dispute was resolved. Mrs C, representing W, has said that this person was not the primary 
contact for the accounts at the time. But given they were still on the mandate allowing them 
to act on the account I still dont think this means NatWest was wrong to take this action. 
And while I know the current representatives of W disagree, I also dont think NatWest was 
under any obligation to consult the other signatories before suspending the account. 
When the required information to reinstate access to the account was provided, from what 
Ive seen it appears that NatWest reinstated the accounts promptly.
So overall, I dont think NatWest has done anything wrong in terms of placing or lifting the 
block on the accounts. And again, I think this action was done with the intention of protecting 
Ws accounts and ensuring they were not misused. So, I also dont agree that NatWest 
wasnt acting in Ws interests.
Looking at the service provided to W, and its representatives, by NatWest, I can see that Ws 
representatives feel very strongly that this was unacceptable. Theyve said NatWests 
explanation was inadequate and NatWest has not acted fairly in accepting the other partys 
instruction regarding the dispute, or behaved fairly in its dealings with W.
As Ive already explained I dont think NatWest was wrong to act on the notification of dispute. And I can see that, once the complaint was raised in January 2019, a response was 
issued promptly. Ws representatives werent happy with this response and continued to 
request a more in-depth explanation. But I dont think NatWest was required to do more, as it 
had already explained they could contact our service. Although I do think it wouldve been 
better if NatWest had acknowledged the further requests.
The information available to me does indicate that NatWest delayed informing Ws 
representatives that the accounts had been reinstated. Given the sensitivity of the issue, that 
was highlighted in the correspondence sent to NatWest while the block was in place, I agree 
that it shouldve informed them of this sooner. And I dont doubt that this was inconvenient 
as otherwise they couldve recommenced account activities on behalf of W sooner.
So, what is left for me to decide is what I think is a fair way to resolve this complaint.
Ws representatives have said that this whole matter caused it and its members significant 
trouble and upset. And it feels NatWest should be required to pay redress that persuades it 
to review its processes.
Our service is not a regulator and our awards are not meant to be punitive in nature. Rather 
we look at what is fair and reasonable in the individual circumstances of the complaint we 
are considering. And here I am looking at the impact on W, the account holder, not its 
members. Here, while I know Ws representatives feel strongly to the contrary, I dont think 
NatWest has done a lot wrong in terms of the process it has followed. And I think a great 
deal of the trouble and upset that has been referred to actually stems from the dispute 
between Ws current and former members, which is not the fault of NatWest.
So, having taken everything into account, I think the recommendation made by the 
investigator, that NatWest pay £100 to address the inconvenience caused by its delay in 
informing W that the block had been lifted from its accounts, is fair
.My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint in part.
To put things right, National Westminster Bank Plc should pay W £100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C, Ms G and 
Mr F on behalf of W to accept or reject my decision before 30 October 2020.
