The complaint  
Mr W complains that MotoNovo Finance Limited didnt collect his car after it had been  
impounded.  
What happened  
In November 2021 Mr W was supplied with a car and entered into a hire purchase  
agreement with MotoNovo.  
In April 2022 the account fell into arrears. Mr W spoke to the collections department at  
MotoNovo to explain why he had failed to make payments.  
In Nove mber 2022 Mr W contacted the collections department and said the car had been  
seized by DVLA due to it having no tax. Mr W told the agent that the car was in a compound  
and asked how he could get it back. The agent advised Mr W that he would need to provid e 
proof of his driving licence, insurance and evidence that the car was either taxed or SORN.  
Mr W contacted the collections department again a couple of days later and said hed been  
advised that it would cost £200 to release the car plus £21 per day stor age. Mr W said he  
wasnt able to pay these fees.  
MotoNovo looked into collecting the car. It calculated the cost of collecting the car and took  
into account the value of the car and the arrears under the agreement and concluded that  
there was no benefit in  collecting the car. MotoNovo removed its interest in the car and  
notified the compound.  
Mr W complained to MotoNovo. He said that MotoNovo had agreed to collect the car and  
return it to him but instead they had failed to let him know what was happening an d the car  
was later sold at auction. Mr W said he wanted MotoNovo to pay compensation for the loss  
of the car and remove his account balance.  
MotoNovo upheld the complaint on the basis that it had provided poor service to Mr W. It  
acknowledged that the col lections department had failed to notify Mr W of its intentions to  
remove its interest in the car. MotoNovo credited Mr Ws bank account with compensation of  
£100 for the distress and inconvenience caused by the poor service.  
Mr W remained unhappy and comp lained to this service,  
Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. They said that Mr W had told the collections  
department that he couldnt pay the fees to collect the car, and that it was reasonable for  
MotoNovo to have removed its interest in the car because when taking into account the level  
of fees and the arrears, and the value of the car, there was no benefit to MotoNovo collecting  
the car.  
Mr W didnt agree. He said that if MotoNovo had told him that it didnt intend to collect the  
car, he couldve found another way to raise the fees to collect it himself, instead of losing the  
car and ending up in debt.  
DRN-4291354What Ive decided  and why  
 
Ive consi dered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and  
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
 
Ive looked at the hire purchase agreement. The terms and conditions say that Mr W agreed  
to keep the car in his possession at all t imes and to pay all outgoings on the car, which  
includes things like tax and insurance. The terms and conditions also say that Mr W is  
responsible for repossession fees and any other fees which arise out of a breach of the  
agreement.  
 
When the car was impou nded, Mr W contacted MotoNovo and said he couldnt pay the fees  
to have the car released from the compound due to his financial circumstances. When Mr W  
spoke to MotoNovo he said the fees to release the car were £200 plus £21 per day storage.  
However, when  MotoNovo looked into collecting the car, it calculated that the fees to release  
the car were significantly more than this.  
 
MotoNovo explained in its final response that the compound fees and recovery costs were  
£347, the recovery agent low loader fee was £198, the cost to replace the keys was £200  
and the auction fee was £100. This came to £845. There were also legal fees of £593, so the  
total costs of collecting the car as calculated by MotoNovo were £1,483.00.  
 
At the time when collection of the car was b eing considered by MotoNovo, the arrears under  
the agreement were £1,157.07. MotoNovo valued the car at £1,175.00.  
 
It was for these reasons that MotoNovo says it decided not to collect the car.  
 
I appreciate that Mr W doesnt agree that all these costs wouldve been payable. Hes  
queried the auction fee and the cost to replace the keys. I agree that if MotoNovo had  
collected the car and returned it to Mr W then there wouldnt have been an auction fee.  
However,the keys wouldve been necessary to move the car from the compound, so I think  
the cost of replacing the keys was likely to have been payable.  
 
The essence of Mr Ws  complaint is that MotoNovo didnt treat him fairly by not giving him  
the opportunity to collect the car himself. Ive thought about this. However, Mr W had already  
told MotoNovo that he couldnt afford to pay the fees to release the car from the compound.  
And from MotoNovos perspective, the account was already in arrears by £1,157.00. If  
MotoNovo had collected the car, Mr W would have been responsible for all the fees. Those  
fees would have been added to his account, which was already in arrears. Mr W wasn t in 
employment at the time and there was no way of knowing whether his financial  
circumstances would change and whether he would be able to start making payments to the  
account again. In these circumstances, I dont think it was unr easonable for MotoNovo  to 
decide that it wasnt commercially viable to collect the car.  
 
Mr W has said that if MotoNovo had told him that it didnt intend to collect the car, he  
wouldve paid the fees himself by borrowing money from friends or by approaching a charity  
for help. I havent seen any evidence that Mr W would have been able to do this. But even if  
he had managed to borrow enough money to release the car, he would still have been in a  
position where his account was in substantial arrears, with the risk that  MotoNovo would  
terminate the agreement and repossess the car. This would have left Mr W with an  
outstanding balance under the agreement (less the sale proceeds of the car, which were  
unlikely to clear the arrears), and with the addition of repossession an d termination fees to  
the account.  
 
 Taking everything into account, I dont think MotoNovo acted unfairly or unreasonably when  
it decided not to collect the car.  
 
MotoNovo has acknowledged that it couldve provided better customer service by letting Mr  
W know what it had decided to do. Ive explained above why I think MotoNovo acted  
reasonably when it decided not to collect the car. I think the compensation paid to Mr W  
already for the poor customer service aspect of this complaint is fair and reasonable. So I  
wont be asking MotoNovo to do anything further.  
 
My final decision  
 
My final decision is that I dont uphold the complaint.  
 
Under the rules of the Financial Omb udsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or  
reject my decision before 15 January 2024.
