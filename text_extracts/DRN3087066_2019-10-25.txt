Ref: DRN30870662my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mr Cs case. 
Ive decided to uphold Mr Cs complaint  in part and have explained why below.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr C 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Cs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Cs complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr C would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr C would have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Cs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about all of these questions and what  they mean for Mr Cs complaint.
Ref: DRN30870663Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that Mr C would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr C would have been  able to do so?
The first of Mr Cs loans  with QuickQuid which I am considering is loan 7. 
When Mr C applied for loan 7, hed been borrowing from QuickQuid without any substantial  
breaks between the loans  for a period of about five months. The amount hed requested  for 
loan 7 was the largest  single amount borrowed up to that point. At this time Mr C had 
declared a net monthly income of £1,280. The repayment for the loan was £831.25  which  
was about 65% of Mr Cs declared income.
At this time, QuickQuid didnt ask Mr C to provide any information  about his monthly 
expenditure. Given the size of the loan compared to Mr Cs income, I dont  think  QuickQuid 
carried out a proportionate affordability check. I dont  think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid 
to assume a payment which represented almost  two thirds of Mr Cs monthly income  was 
likely to be affordable  without knowing anything about his monthly  expenditure. 
Its notable that there was only a gap of a few days since loan 6 was repaid and the amount  
Mr C borrowed  for loan 7 was similar to the £857  Mr C had paid to settle loan 6. So it 
appears that settling  loan 6 likely  caused  Mr C to need to borrow  again. Thats  not a 
sustainable situation  and I think QuickQuid  ought to have realised that a loan with such a 
large repayment relative to Mr Cs income  was always likely to be unsustainable.  Im 
therefore upholding the complaint about  loan 7.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 8 to 16 because  
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why this is the case  in the next section.
Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall pattern of 
lending increase Mr Cs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending.  Ive looked to see if there was a point at 
which QuickQuid should reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable,  or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Cs case,  I think  that this point 
was reached by loan 8. I say this because:
Mr C had been borrowing from QuickQuid  for about six months without break  
between March and September 2012.  The amounts he was borrowing were 
increasing during  this period. And QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was likely his 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Although there was then a break of about four months  between  loans 7 and 8, I dont 
think that this was a significant enough  break that QuickQuid could have reasonably  
thought there had been a positive  change to Mr Cs financial situation. And had 
QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks at this stage  (such  as asking Mr C for 
proof of income and expenditure) it likely wouldve seen  that Mr Cs expenditure 
around that period exceeded his income. For example, Ive seen he owed over 
£1,000 to a charge card provider.
Ref: DRN30870664Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to reducing  his indebtedness to QuickQuid. And 
he was in effect paying large amounts of interest to service this debt over an 
extended period
Mr C was demonstrating repayment difficulties from March 2013   and notified 
QuickQuid of a reduction in his income.  But QuickQuid continued to lend to him after 
this, charging him late fees on loans 10, 11, 12, 15 and 16.
I think that Mr C lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from loan 8 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Cs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans
So Im upholding  Mr Cs complaint about  loans  8 to 16 because  the overall  pattern of lending 
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  and he lost 
out as a result.
I consider that there was a significant  break between  loans 16 and 17. I dont think 
QuickQuid acted unfairly when it approved loan 17. It assessed Mr Cs income and 
expenditure at this time and given  the break between  loans  16 and 17 I dont think  it acted 
unfairly by relying  on what Mr C had told it. It was reasonable for QuickQuid to think loan 17 
was affordable.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr C in some 
other way.  
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 7 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan 7 from Mr Cs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from 8 means any information recorded about them is 
adverse. So all entries about  loans 8 to 16 should be removed from Mr Cs credit  file
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN30870665my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that Im partially upholding Mr Cs 
complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by taking the steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 November  2019.
