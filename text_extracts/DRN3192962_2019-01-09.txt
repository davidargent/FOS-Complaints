K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest)  failed  to recover a payment 
which was sent to the wrong account.
background
In December 2017 Mr H made an error when transferring £20000.  He contacted  NatWest  
the following  day to ask it to cancel the transaction. Mr H says the recovery process  was 
unsuccessful due to NatWests lack of urgency and unprofessionalism. He doesnt think  they 
acted quickly enough in requesting the funds back from the recipients bank. So he wants 
NatWest to re-credit the £20000 to his account.
NatWest said there  was no evidence the bank had done anything wrong. Itd tried to recover  
the funds. But it was done on a best endeavours basis. When  Mr H spoke to the bank in 
February 2018 it informed  him if it didnt get a response by 6 March it would be unable to 
recover the funds.  NatWest said Mr H told them he no longer wished to continue the case. 
And NatWest should close it. So NatWest ended its recovery  process.
Mr H wasnt satisfied with NatWests response.  So he contacted our service  and our 
investigator looked into the matter. He could appreciate how frustrating this mustve been for 
Mr H. But he felt NatWest had made reasonable efforts to try and recover the payment. And 
the recovery process had been cancelled by Mr H after there hadnt been any success.
Mr H didnt agree. He had contacted NatWest on the day after the payment. But the bank 
had dismissed his request. He was only offered the opportunity to complete a credit payment 
recovery form when he contacted NatWest again in January 2018. So hes asked for an 
ombudsmans final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand Mr Hs frustration. He made a mobile payment of £20000  on 23 December 
2017. But it was sent to the wrong  account. And Mr H feels  NatWest didnt do enough  to 
recover his funds. So Ive looked carefully  at what NatWest has done  to try and help Mr H 
put things right.
Mr H said he contacted  NatWest on 24 December after he realised  he had sent the money 
to the wrong recipient. But it was told too late to stop the transaction  from taking place. He 
says NatWest only tried a credit payment recovery after he spoke to it again in January.
Mr H has provided details  of the December call to NatWest. But unfortunately the bank 
hasnt been able to find a copy of the conversation on its system. So its not possible  to be 
sure exactly  what  was said to Mr H. But in any event I dont  think  the payment recovery was 
affected by any initial  delay.
Once a payment has been made banks can normally only try and recover  the money on a 
best endeavours basis. They contact  the receiving bank and ask it to speak to the recipient 
and request that the funds  are returned. 
Ref: DRN31929622But they arent able to take the funds from the recipients account without their permission - 
even if Mr H didnt mean  to send the money to them. 
I can see the recipient  of the payment is known to Mr H. Hes made a number of payments 
to the account  both before and after the incorrect transaction.  And it appears during one of 
the calls to NatWest Mr H said he had meant  to send £200 but had put in too many zeros.
So I hope Mr H is able to discuss the return of his money directly with the recipient.
I realise how frustrating this must be for Mr H. But. I think NatWest has made reasonable 
efforts to try and recover the payment. And even if Mr H was given some  confusing 
information when  he called in December I dont  think  it wouldve made any difference to the 
outcome. Banks can only ask the recipient to return payments. They  arent able to retrieve  
money without permission. 
I know Mr H will be disappointed with this outcome. But based on what  Ive seen I cant 
really say NatWest has done anything wrong. And I wont be asking it to do anything  more.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 February  2019.
