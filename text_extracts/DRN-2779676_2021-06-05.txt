The complaint
 Mr and Mrs W have complained that CarCashPoint Limited lent to them irresponsibly. 
What happened
Mr and Mrs W were given two logbook loans by CarCashPoint in April and May 2012. The 
loans were secured against a vehicle that they owned.
Loan 1 in April 2012 was for £1, 060 repayable in 78 weekly instalments of around 
£38. The total amount payable if the loan ran to term, including interest, was around 
£2,968.
Loan 2 in May 2012 was for £3,060 repayable in 156 weekly instalments of around 
£90. The total amount payable, if the loan ran to term, including interest, was just 
over £14,077.
I understand both loans accounts are now closed.
CarCashPoint thought that too much time had passed for the complaint to be considered. 
But following an ombudsmans decision that this Service could look into the matter, an 
adjudicator looked into the complaint. He thought CarCashPoint shouldnt have provided Mr 
and Mrs W with the second loan and he asked the lender to put things right. CarCashPoint 
didnt agree with adjudicators assessment.
As the complaint has not been settled, it has been passed to me to make a final decision.    
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to considering unaffordable and irresponsible lending complaints 
on our website - including the key relevant rules, guidance, good industry practice and law. 
And Ive considered this approach when deciding Mr and Mrs Ws complaint.
I think there are overarching questions I need to consider in order to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this particular complaint:
Did CarCashPoint complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr and Mrs W would be able to repay their loans in a sustainable way? If so, did it 
make a fair lending decision each time? If not, what would reasonable and 
proportionate checks have shown at the time?
Did CarCashPoint act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
CarCashPoint needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend to Mr and Mrs W 
irresponsibly. This means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that they could repay the loans in a sustainable way. The lender was required to carry out a 
borrower focussed assessment - sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or 
affordability check. 
The checks had to be borrower focussed  so CarCashPoint had to think about whether 
repaying the loans sustainably would cause any difficulties or adverse consequences for Mr 
and Mrs W. In other words, it wasnt enough for CarCashPoint to simply think about the 
likelihood of it getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of loan repayments on Mr 
and Mrs W.
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of each loan application. 
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer, such as their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications 
of vulnerability or financial difficulty and the amount / type / cost of credit they are seeking. 
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough: 
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); and 
the longer the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit is 
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make payments for an extended 
period).
Ive carefully considered all the evidence, arguments and information Ive seen about this 
matter and what it means for Mr and Mrs W. 
CarCashPoint has told us that it no longer holds much information about what happened 
when it provided each loan. So I have thought about whether there is sufficient evidence 
available overall for me to make a fair and reasonable decision. On balance, I think there is.
Loan 1
There is very limited information available about what happened when Mr and Mrs W applied 
for their first loan in April 2012. Or what checks CarCashPoint carried out before agreeing to 
the loan. So I cant say whether these checks were reasonable or proportionate at the time. 
But taking everything into account, I cant fairly say it was unreasonable for CarCashPoint to 
have provided Loan 1 to Mr and Mrs W. So I dont uphold their complaint about this loan.
Loan 2
The information about what happened when Mr and Mrs W applied for the second loan in 
May 2012 is also limited.
CarCashPoint says it no longer holds Mr and Mrs Ws affordability information (principally 
bank statements). It says it holds an employment contract for Mrs W and sub-contractor 
invoices from Mr W  which suggests its possible that Mr W may have been self-employed at the time. Its not clear, from what Ive seen, what income and expenditure Mr and Mrs W 
declared to CarCashPoint when they applied for the second loan, just a month after taking 
the first loan. CarCashPoint says that it holds an email from Mrs W explaining why she 
wanted to increase the loan amount they had taken a month earlier. It says that Mrs W 
explained that they had wanted to take a small loan initially as they had little experience with 
this type of loan, but now wanted to request an amount that we really need for £4,500. 
CarCashPoint agreed to lend a lower amount of £3,060.
CarCashPoint says both loans were managed very well and were never in arrears. It also 
thinks that there was no detriment to Mr and Mrs W from taking these loans.
I accept that it is difficult to assess what happened when Mr and Mrs W applied for the 
second loan as the information now available is limited. However, I would have expected the 
lender to want to gather enough information for it to have a thorough understanding of Mr 
and Mrs Ws financial position, to ensure that they could repay this loan sustainably. I think it 
would have been proportionate in the circumstances for CarCashPoint to have taken steps 
to independently verify Mr and Mrs Ws circumstances. CarCashPoint suggests it would 
have reviewed bank statements, but it no longer holds these on file. I dont know whether 
CarCashPoint acquired credit reports at the time.
Mr and Mrs W have provided bank statements for the months leading up to their second loan 
application. They have also provided further evidence about loans that Mrs W had been 
taking and extracts from credits reports. Different checks show different things, but I think its 
likely that if CarCashPoint had carried out reasonable and proportionate checks at the time, 
the information it would most likely have gathered would have been broadly similar to the 
information that Mr and Mrs W have been able to provide to us.
The bank statements show that Mr and Mrs W had remained largely in credit in the months 
running up to their loans from CarCashPoint. But taking the evidence as a whole, it seems 
that Mr and Mrs W had been taking payday loans and advances against income in the 
months before they applied to CarCashpoint for their second loan. There is also some 
evidence that Mr W had struggled to repay credit in the past. Mr and Mrs W were returning 
to borrow three times the amount just a month after taking their first loan from CarCashPoint. 
They also asked to borrow a higher amount than was eventually agreed  which suggests 
that CarCashPoint may have had some concerns about their ability to repay the lending. 
CarCashPoint may have assessed that, on the face of it, the loan was affordable for Mr and 
Mrs W, on a pounds and pence basis. CarCashPoint says it doesnt think its lending caused 
Mr and Mrs W any detriment. But CarCashPoint was required to establish whether the 
borrowers could sustainably repay their loan  not just whether the loan payments were 
technically affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
On balance, I think if CarCashPoint had carried out reasonable and proportionate checks at 
the time, it ought reasonably to have recognised that Mr and Mrs W were beginning to 
experience some difficulty managing their financial situation. This was an expensive loan 
which required Mr and Mrs W to repay over £14,000 over three years. I think CarCashPoint ought reasonably to have realised that these consumers might struggle to repay their loan 
sustainably over the extended loan period and that this second loan might tip them over the 
edge and increase their financial difficulties. From what Ive seen, this was indeed the case. 
This is a marginal decision, given the limited information available. But taking things in the 
round, I think CarCashPoint ought reasonably to have concluded that it was not appropriate 
to provide Mr and Mrs W with the second loan.
I havent seen anything which makes me think that CarCashPoint treated Mr and Mrs W 
unfairly in any other way. But I dont think it should have provided the second loan to them. 
So CarCashPoint needs to put things right.
  
Putting things right
I think its fair and reasonable for Mr and Mrs W to have repaid the principal amount that they 
borrowed, because they had the benefit of that lending. But they have paid interest and 
charges on a loan that shouldnt have been provided to them. 
I havent seen anything to suggest that Mr and Mrs W didnt repay the loan or that their car 
was repossessed by the lender. However, if CarCashPoint sold any outstanding debt 
payable in respect of Mr and Mrs Ws loan, it should buy it back from the third party, if its 
able to do so, and then take the following steps. If CarCashPoint isnt able to buy any 
outstanding debt back then it should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results 
outlined below.
CarCashPoint should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges from Loan 2 taken in May 2012 and treat 
all the payments Mr and Mrs W made as payments towards the capital. 
If reworking Mr and Mrs Ws loan account results in them having effectively made 
payments above the original capital borrowed, then CarCashPoint should refund 
these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, 
from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is 
settled*. 
If reworking the account leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, then 
CarCashPoint should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr and Mrs 
W, bearing in mind its obligation to treat them positively and sympathetically in 
these discussions.
CarCashPoint might have already returned the logbook to Mr and Mrs W, but if it 
has not done this, it should cancel the bill of sale and return the V5 document to 
them once any outstanding capital has been repaid.
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr and Mrs Ws credit file in 
relation to Loan 2.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to deduct tax from this interest. 
CarCashPoint should give Mr and Mrs W a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if 
they ask for one.
  
My final decisionMy final decision is that I partly uphold Mr and Mrs Ws complaint and direct CarCashPoint 
Limited to put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W and Mr W 
to accept or reject my decision before 3 July 2021.
