K821x#15complaint
Mr K says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading  as Sunny irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 43 loans Sunny provided to Mr K between  October 2016  and 
October 2018. Mr Ks borrowing history  is set out in the appendix at the end of this decision.
Mr K says he was reliant on loan companies.  He has told us he had to borrow to repay his 
previous loans and he was struggling to repay household bills because  of his debts.
In its final response Sunny told Mr K it did not uphold his complaint. It said that it had carried 
out eligibility,  creditworthiness and affordability checks which were proportionate  and 
sufficient for all the loans.  
Sunny later revised its position  and said it would  put things right from loan 16. It offered Mr K 
£963.25, to write off the outstanding balance on Mr Ks accounts  and amend  his credit file.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunnys  offer went far enough and said Mr Ks complaint should 
be upheld from loan 6 onwards. She said by loan 6 Mr Ks overall pattern of borrowing 
suggested hed become  persistently reliant  on short term loans.  Sunny  disagreed  with this 
view but maintained its offer to put things right from loan 16 onwards. Later it reviewed  its 
position and offered £1,326.63 to put things right from loan 13 onwards.
Mr K did not accept Sunnys offer and as the parties  are not in agreement the complaint was 
passed to me to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr K could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN24327322the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr K could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint. Ive decided to uphold this complaint  
from loan 6 onwards.  Ill explain  why.
For the first four loans I think the checks were proportionate and sufficient. I think Sunny  
should have done more  when it gave Mr K loan 5 but I cant  say that the checks or any extra  
checks would have  revealed at that time that he couldnt sustainably  repay  his loans 
because Ive not seen any information about  Mr Ks financial situation  at the time. So, I cant  
say it was unfair for Sunny to give Mr K loans 1-5.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr K, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ks case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr K was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr K had taken out six loans within four months  and Mr K had been 
indebted to Sunny  for the whole of that time.  At the point he took out loan 6 Mr K also 
had loans 3 and 5 outstanding and although Loan  6 was taken out for £50.00 which  
was the lowest  amount he had borrowed so far, at that time he also had loan 3 for 
£300.00 and loan 5 for £200  outstanding. So Sunny ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr K was having  to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Ks indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ks first loan was for £100  and loan 6 was for £50. But as I said above,  at the 
point he took out loan 6 Mr K also had loans  3 and 5 outstanding.  At this point  Sunny  
Ref: DRN24327323ought to have known that Mr K was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall 
in his income but to meet an ongoing  need.  
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr K was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one. On many  occasions Mr K had still not repaid  his previous loans leaving 
him with numerous  outstanding loans at the same time.  Often Mr K repaid the loans 
earlier than he had agreed so it doesnt  look like he was using these loans in the way 
they were intended.
Mr K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 43 was 
taken out almost two years after Mr Ks first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr K had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr K lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ks indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr K borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ks ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loan 6 -43 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do;
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr K loans 6-43.
I understand that Mr K still has loan 37 and loans  41-43 outstanding. If Sunny has sold the 
outstanding debts to a third party, it should buy these back if it is able to do so and then take 
the following  steps.
If Sunny is not able to buy the debt back, then it should liaise with the new debt owner to 
achieve the results  outlined  below.
A)Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Mr K towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything  you have already  refunded.
B)Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual payments made by Mr K 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr K originally made 
the payments,  to the date the complaint is settled.
C)Sunny  should  remove all interest,  fees and charges  from the balance  on any upheld 
outstanding loans and treat any repayments  made by Mr K as though they  had been  
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr K having 
made overpayments  then it should  refund these  overpayments  with 8% simple  
interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments  would 
have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Sunny  should  then refund  the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step E.
Ref: DRN24327324D)If there  is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts  calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans and any 
principal Sunny has already written-off.  If this results in a surplus,  then the surplus 
should be paid to Mr K. However,  if there is still an outstanding balance then Sunny 
should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr K. Sunny shouldnt pursue  
outstanding balances made  up of principal Sunny has already written-off.  
E)The overall pattern  of Mr Ks borrowing for loans 6 onwards means any information  
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove  these loans entirely from 
Mr Ks credit file. Sunny does not have to remove loan 37 or loans  41-43  from Mr Ks 
credit file until these have been  repaid, but it should  still remove any adverse 
information recorded about these  loans.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr K a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ks complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr K compensation  as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 April 2020.
