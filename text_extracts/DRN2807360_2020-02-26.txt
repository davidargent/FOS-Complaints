K821x#15complaint
Mr T complains that Harvey & Thompson Limited  (H&T) lent to him in an irresponsible  
manner.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in the provisional decision I issued in 
January 2020.  An extract from this is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I will 
not repeat  that information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to uphold the some of the complaint. 
I invited both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. Mr T has said that 
he accepts my provisional decision.  H&T hasnt responded to that decision.
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Given that neither party has provided 
me with any new evidence or further comments I see no reason  to alter the conclusions 
I reached in my provisional  decision. But I have provided some further clarification  on how 
the compensation should be calculated.
I dont think H&T should have agreed to lend to Mr T from loan 5 onwards. H&T needs to 
pay Mr T some compensation.
putting things right
I dont think H&T should have agreed to lend to Mr T after,  and including,  the loan that he 
took on 17 November  2009 (loan  5). So H&T should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr T on loans 5 to 33. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loan 34 and treat any payments 
Mr T made  towards this loan as payments towards the capital
if reworking Mr Ts loan 34 account as Ive directed results in Mr T effectively having 
made payments  above the original  capital borrowed, then H&T should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments,  from the date the 
overpayments would  have arisen, to the date of settlement*. 
If reworking Mr Ts loan 34 account leaves an amount  of capital still to be paid,  then H&T 
can use the total refund for loans 5 to 33 (after  the deduction of tax) to offset  this. And if 
there is still an outstanding capital balance  then I remind H&T that it should take a 
sympathetic view when seeking  to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr T.
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Ts credit file in relation to loans 5 
and 6.
remove all information about loans 7 to 33 from Mr Ts credit file, and about  loan 34 
when it is fully repaid
*HM Revenue & Customs requires H&T to take off tax from this interest. H&T must give Mr T 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN28073602my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ts complaint and direct Harvey  & Thompson Limited to 
put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 March  2020.

complaint
Mr T complains that Harvey  & Thompson Limited (H&T) lent to him in an irresponsible manner.
background
Mr T first borrowed seven loans from H&T in 2002. But I am only able to consider complaints about 
lending that took place after April 2007. So those  loans  wont  form part of this complaint.
Mr T then restarted borrowing from H&T in September 2009. There had been a significant gap since 
his earlier borrowing  in 2002 so I think it would have been reasonable  for H&T to treat Mr T as a new 
customer at that point.  The loans that Mr T took from H&T were slightly  different from most payday 
loans. Mr T would apply for the loans in one of H&Ts shops. The loans were denominated in amounts 
of £100 and on application  Mr T would provide  H&T with a cheque  for that amount that would be 
cashed the following month as repayment of the loan.  H&T would  then provide Mr T with a cash  
pay-out of £100 less the interest due on the loan. The following  month, when the loan was due to be 
repaid, H&T would present the cheque to the bank,  or Mr T would be able to defer the repayment for 
another month by paying  an additional interest charge.
I need to be clear about  how I have assessed Mr Ts borrowing from H&T.  Mr T was able to take a 
number of £100 loans  as part of a single transaction. So I have treated all borrowing on the same day 
as if it were a single loan. And since that borrowing was backed by multiple £100 cheques  parts of a 
single days borrowing could be repaid at different  times. So Ive considered  the closure date of a loan 
to be when all of the constituent £100 loans  have been repaid.  And on a couple of occasions  Mr Ts 
cheques werent honoured by his bank   in that case he needed to make a separate  repayment to 
H&T. So Ive considered  those loans to be closed  when that additional payment happened.
In total I consider that, from April 2007 onwards, Mr T was given  34 loans by H&T.  All except  his final 
loan have been successfully  repaid. The cheques used to support the final loan were  not honoured 
and so a balance remains outstanding. A summary of Mr Ts borrowing  from H&T that comprises  this 
complaint is shown as an appendix to this decision. 
Mr Ts complaint has been  assessed by one of our adjudicators. She thought it had been reasonable 
for H&T to give the first four loans to Mr T. But she didnt think any of the remaining loans should  have 
been agreed.  So she asked  H&T to pay Mr T some  compensation.
H&T didnt respond  to that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt  been resolved informally, it has 
been passed  to me, an ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
H&T needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this means  
that it should  have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr T could repay  the loans in a 
sustainable manner. These checks could take into account  a number of different things,  such as how 
much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN28073604But certain factors might  point to the fact that H&T should fairly and reasonably have  done more to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for a consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that H&T was required to establish  whether  Mr T 
could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and in 
particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Ts complaint.
H&T has told us that it considers Mr Ts borrowing fell into two distinct chains. It says the loans he 
took between 2009 and 2011 were under  a single  running  credit agreement. So H&T has said that it 
didnt need to conduct additional affordability assessments once the account  had been opened. And it 
says the loans  Mr T took in 2012 were in fact a single loan that was rolled over a number of times.
I disagree with what H&T has said here for a number of reasons. I dont accept that it was reasonable 
to consider the loans spanning a period  of over two years  should  be considered to form part of a 
single running credit agreement. H&Ts records clearly show that the amounts Mr T borrowed 
fluctuated, and that he repaid those loans regularly.  So I think  it more reasonable  to consider them  as 
separate lending events.  I also dont accept that the loans in 2012 should form a separate  lending 
chain. There was only a gap of around 5 weeks before  those loans when Mr T was without a loan 
from H&T. Particularly considering what had gone before, I dont think  that was anywhere near long 
enough for H&T to have  any confidence Mr Ts finances had returned to a more stable footing. And 
for the borrowing in 2012, the amounts that Mr T borrowed from H&T steadily  increased  that doesnt 
seem to be a single loan being rolled over a number of times.
H&T hasnt  told us what checks it did before lending to Mr T. But it has said that it considers it 
complied with the relevant regulations at the time. But given I dont have much information  from Mr T 
about his circumstances at that time I find it difficult to conclude that proportionate checks  are likely to 
have shown H&T that it shouldnt have given the first four loans to Mr T.
But I think, when Mr T asked  for his fifth loan, H&T should have  realised that it was unlikely he was 
using its borrowing to cover a short term emergency. I think Mr Ts pattern of borrowing  was far more 
suggestive of someone  who was finding it increasingly  difficult  to manage his money. He had failed to 
repay his early loans when  they were due, needing instead to pay additional interest to defer his 
Ref: DRN28073605repayment for a further month. And when he took the additional  borrowing at loan 5, Mr T once more 
took his total outstanding to the level at which  it had begun some two months earlier. So I think  H&T 
should have stopped lending at that point.
Mr T continued to borrow from H&T for a further three years. There was a short break in his borrowing 
in September 2011 and another  in early 2012. But apart from those  short periods Mr T was 
consistently in debt to H&T, with up to £900 outstanding at any one time. Mr T continued to be unable  
to repay his loans as scheduled with some loans spanning more  than six months rather than the one 
month that was originally  agreed.  I think this borrowing behaviour should  have reinforced to H&T that 
Mr T was most likely having significant problems  managing  his money and that it was more likely  than 
not he was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loans was leaving in his 
finances.
I think  that Mr T lost out because  H&T continued to provide borrowing  to him because these  loans 
had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to take expensive credit 
intended for short-term use over an extended period  of time.  The sheer  number of loans was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ts ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost  loans.
So I dont think H&T should have agreed to lend to Mr T from loan 5 onwards.  H&T needs to pay Mr T 
some compensation.
