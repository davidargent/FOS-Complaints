K821x#15complaint
Ms G has complained about a number of loans  she took out through  a company  called  
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Ms G says she was lent 
to irresponsibly and the loans caused her financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny.
background
We now know that Ms G took out 8 instalment loans from Sunny between  July 2016 and 
January 2017.  Ive enclosed a summary  of Ms Gs borrowing with Sunny, based  on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan 5 onwards. Sunny doesnt  agree with this and says that it didnt do 
anything wrong. The complaint has therefore  come to me for an ombudsmans  final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Ms Gs 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Ms G could repay all the loans she was given in a sustainable  manner. These checks ought 
to have taken  into account a range of different  factors,  such as the amounts being lent, the 
total repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN62083942There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms G could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Ms G could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Ms G. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern of lending history 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loans 1, 2, 3 and 4 ought not to 
be upheld as they appeared affordable. Ive looked carefully at these and taken note of Ms 
Gs declared income. Ive also looked at what she said about her monthly  expenditure. 
With this information,  and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks which Sunny most likely carried  out appear to have  
been proportionate for loans 1  4. And I think these  levels  of checks,  together  with the 
income and expenditure details provided  by Ms G, would have made  those particular loans 
appear affordable  for her. 
However, I think at the point of loan 5 in this case things would have looked different and 
therefore required a more thorough and responsible approach from Sunny. For loan 5, for 
example, Sunny ought to have been aware  this was her 5th such  loan in less than 4 months. 
Previous Sunny loans  shed  taken  out were  also still outstanding at the time.
Theres no evidence Sunny altered its approach at the point of loan 5 to look more 
thoroughly at Ms Gs financial situation. I think if it had done  this it would have shown she 
was having trouble managing her money  and that her borrowing was to meet normal 
ongoing commitments  and those of her other  lending. So I think it was irresponsible to lend 
to Ms G at this point.
In addition to the above,  from the point of loan 6 onwards,  there was an additional and clear 
pattern of repeated lending evident  in my view. Loan  6 directly followed loan 5 by just 4 
weeks, but again, it was whilst other loans remained outstanding. So there was an obvious 
dependency on high-interest, short-term lending evidenced by this, her 6th loan in under 5 
months. 
So Im also upholding  Ms Gs complaint in respect of loans 6, 7 and 8 as well. Sunny 
repeatedly lent to Ms G in an unsustainable  manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
Ref: DRN62083943the length of time over which Ms G borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms G paid on loans 5, 6, 7, and 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Ms Gs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6, 7 and 8 should  be completely 
removed from Ms Gs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Ms G a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Ms Gs complaint. Elevate Credit  International Limited  
should put things right for Ms G as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 February  2020.
