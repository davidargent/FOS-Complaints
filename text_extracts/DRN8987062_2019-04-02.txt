K821x#15complaint
This is a complaint  that Financial Insurance Company Limited  (FICL) mis-sold payment  
protection insurance (PPI) to Mrs J. FICL  didnt  actually  sell the policy, but it has taken 
responsibility for the sale. So Ill refer to it as the seller. 
background
This complaint is about a PPI policy  taken  out in August 2004 alongside a store credit 
account. Mrs J was sold the policy at the same time that she applied for the account.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint be upheld.  FICL didnt agree with the 
adjudicators opinion, so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  this case.  
Ive decided to uphold Mrs Js complaint.  This is because I dont think  FICL set out clearly 
enough the costs and benefits of the PPI policy, when it was sold to Mrs J. This means she 
didnt have the chance to make an informed choice. I think,  in her circumstances, this would 
have made  a difference to whether she took PPI. Her work benefits are likely  to have made 
her think  the cost of the PPI was not good value  for her. 
I think Mrs J has lost out as a result. FICL has questioned whether Mrs J would  have 
received the work benefits she says she had. But I have not seen anything that would 
suggest Mrs J had anything other  than what  she said she had. She has been consistent to 
our service  about her work benefits  throughout her complaint. So I uphold her complaint for 
the reasons I have  given above. 
fair compensation
Financial Insurance  Company Limited should  put Mrs J in the financial position shed be in 
now if she hadnt taken  out PPI.
A.FICL should find out how much  Mrs J would  have  owed  when she closed her credit 
account if the policy hadnt  been  added.
So, it should  remove the PPI premiums added, as well as any interest charged  on those 
premiums. It should also remove any charges that were caused  by the mis-sale of the 
PPI  as well as any interest added  to those charges. 
FICL should then refund  the difference between what  Mrs J owed when she closed her 
account and what  she would have owed if she hadnt had PPI.
If Mrs J made a successful claim under the PPI policy, FICL can take off what she got 
for the claim from the amount it owes her.  
Ref: DRN89870622B.FICL should add simple interest on the difference between what Mrs J would have owed 
when she closed her account,  from when she closed it until she gets the refund. The 
interest rate should  be 8% a year.
C.If  when  FICL works out what Mrs J would have owed each month  without PPI  Mrs J 
paid more than enough  to clear  her balance, FICL should  also pay simple interest on the 
extra Mrs J paid. And it should  carry on paying  interest  until the point when Mrs J 
wouldve owed FICL  something on her credit.  The interest rate should be 8% a year.
D.FICL should tell Mrs J what its done to work  out A, B and C.
 HM Revenue  & Customs  requires FICL to take off tax from this interest. FICL must give 
Mrs J a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im upholding Mrs Js complaint. I require Financial  Insurance 
Company Limited  to pay compensation  as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 May 2019.
