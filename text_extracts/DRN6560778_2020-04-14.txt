This complaint is about twelve short-term loans Sunny  provided  to Mr W between  January 
2017 and September 2017. Mr Ws borrowing history is as follows:

12 29/09/17 15/11/18 £350 6 months £112.09
*At times,  Mr W had more than one loan outstanding at the same time,  this is the total amount due in 
any one month at the time of taking out the new loan.
Sunny has already made an offer on loans eleven and twelve.
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mr Ws complaint and partially upheld it. Sunny didnt 
agree.
A different adjudicator  looked at the complaint  again, and came  to a different outcome, but 
still partially upheld  the complaint. Sunny hasnt responded to this, so the complaint was 
passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN65607782But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, by the time Sunny  provided Mr W with loan seven, it shouldve 
realised that he was having difficulty managing his repayments  in a sustainable way.
And I agree. By the time Sunny provided Mr W with loan seven, the time between  loans was 
decreasing, and he was borrowing again  with decreasing gaps. This was also his seventh 
loan within  three  months. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ws case,  I think  that this point was reached by 
loan nine. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay their 
loans sustainably. Mr W had taken out nine loans within  four months. And Mr W had 
been indebted to Sunny for almost this entire time. So Sunny ought to have realised 
it was more likely than not Mr W was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole 
Ref: DRN65607783repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ws indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Ws first loan was for £100 and loan nine was for £400. At this point Sunny ought 
to have known  that Mr W was not likely  borrowing  to meet  a temporary  shortfall in 
their income but to meet an ongoing need.  
Mr W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan twelve 
was taken out eight months  after Mr Ws first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr W 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan nine 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness  by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of Mr W borrowed  was likely  to have had negative implications on Mr Ws 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans seven and eight  and loans nine to twelve  
and Sunny should put things right.
putting things  right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans seven to twelve;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans seven and eight from Mr Ws credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan nine onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  nine onwards should  be removed 
from Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr W a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 May 2020.
