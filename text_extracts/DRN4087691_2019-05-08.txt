Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ns complaint. She thought none  of the loans  shouldve  been 
given. Smart-Pig disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Smart-Pig needed to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr N 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Smart-Pig  should fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN40876912refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Smart-Pig was required to establish 
whether Mr N could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ns complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, proportionate checks for loans 1 to 3 would most likely have 
shown that Mr N couldnt have afforded to repay  these loans sustainably.
Smart-Pig did carry out some checks before lending. As it lends only to students, Smart-Pig 
asked Mr N for proof of his student  finance  payments  which included a student  
maintenance loan and a grant totalling £2,400 per term. Smart-Pig treated this as termly 
income of £800  a month, which I think was reasonable. 
Smart-Pig says it also carried  out credit checks  although it hasnt provided  the results  of 
these  only a brief summary.  Smart-Pig says its credit checks  showed Mr N had two loans 
and a credit  card until 9 January 2015 (I assume  it means 9 January 2016, when Mr N 
applied for loan 5) and three  loans  and two credit cards on or after this date. So it decreased 
his credit limit from £350 to £100.
I dont think these checks were proportionate,  particularly bearing in mind Mr Ns need to 
keep to a relatively  modest monthly  budget.  Smart-Pig didnt ask Mr N any questions  at all 
about his expenditure  rather it says made a number of assumptions. For example:
it assumed Mr Ns travel costs included spending £3 per day taking the train to 
university
it assumed Mr N shared his accommodation with two other  people  and that he 
therefore paid one third of an average  amount for the area each month in rent and 
utility costs
Smart-Pig hasnt provided any justification for its assumptions and estimates.  And it seems 
to me that it was taking something of a risk by making some  of these assumptions. 
Assuming that Mr Ns only travelling  expenses would be to university and back  (and that this 
would be by train)  risks overlooking any number of other possibilities and related expenses   
Ref: DRN40876913such as car insurance  and other  car running  costs   which Mr N did in fact have. It seems  
odd to me that Smart-Pig would assume Mr N didnt have  monthly  expenses  like this, 
instead of simply asking him whether  or not he did. Assuming  Mr Ns rent and utility bills 
were an average amount  that was shared  with an average number of people for the area, 
instead of asking him what his actual rent and utility bills were  carried a similar  risk.
Given that Mr N was a student, whose only income was from maintenance loans and grants, 
I think it wouldve been particularly important for Smart-Pig to understand his monthly 
budget. Our adjudicator thought that Smart-Pig  shouldve  asked  Mr N about his monthly  
living costs  and his regular credit commitments  when  he applied  for loans 1 to 3  and 
I agree  this sort of check wouldve been proportionate in the circumstances.
Smart-Pig thinks  Mr Ns termly expenditure wouldnt have been  more than £2,000. This 
figure again seems  to be largely based on averages and estimates  rather than any figures 
actually obtained  from Mr N. 
From what  Ive seen of Mr Ns bank statements, I think his termly living costs were  likely to 
be higher than £2,000. But even if I were to accept the lower figure proposed  by Smart-Pig, 
I dont think it demonstrates that loans 1-3 were sustainably affordable  for Mr N. If his living 
costs were £2,000  per term,  hed be left with £400 to repay £525 to Smart-Pig.  Thats not a 
sustainable amount,  based on Mr Ns income  particularly when also considering  Mr Ns 
ability to manage any unexpected  costs  over a three month  period.
So I think its likely proportionate checks wouldve suggested loans 1-3 were not sustainably 
affordable for Mr N and Im upholding his complaint about these loans.
From the information Ive seen from Mr Ns credit report  (provided by him), the additional  
credit commitments  he had from loan 4 onwards included termly commitments of £420 a 
month towards a guarantor loan. He also had various payday loans from a number of other 
lenders from loan 4 onwards. But just taking  into account the guarantor loan  and Mr Ns 
termly income and living  costs  suggests he wasnt in a position to sustainably repay any 
additional credit  commitments.  So its likely  proportionate affordability checks  (such  as 
asking about and validating Mr Ns expenditure) wouldve highlighted the loans from 4 
onwards were likely  to have been unaffordable too.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Smart-Pigs  lending history with Mr N, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Smart-Pig should reasonably have seen  that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Smart-Pig should  have  realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans.
Ref: DRN40876914Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ns case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
4. I say this because loan 4 was the fourth time Mr N had had been provided  with a new loan 
within days of settling  a previous one. So Smart-Pig ought to have realised it was more  likely 
than not Mr N was having  to borrow  further  to cover  the hole repaying his previous  loan was 
leaving in his finances and that Mr Ns indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
I note that Smart-Pig says on its website  that, Smart-Pig loans are short term  they are not 
a long term solution to debt issues. Our loans are not for customers looking to pay off 
another debt,  or finance an unsustainable  cost of living.
As outlined  above,  I think Smart-Pig shouldve realised it was likely Mr N was using the loans 
either essentially to pay off another debt (because  of the hole repaying debts left in his 
finances), or because  Mr N wasnt able to sustain his usual living costs from his income.
I note the amounts Mr N borrowed  decreased from loan 5. But it seems this was because 
Smart-Pig reduced the amount it was willing  to lend him and not because  Mr N decided  or 
needed to borrow  less. So I dont think this suggested Mr Ns indebtedness was decreasing 
and becoming  sustainable. Smart-Pig  has acknowledged it knew his indebtedness 
elsewhere was increasing  although it hasnt provided figures for what it saw  and that this 
is why the amounts it was willing to lend to Mr N decreased.
I think that Mr N lost out because Smart-Pig  continued to provide borrowing from loan 4 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ns indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time
the number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ns ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans
In saying the above, Ive taken into account  that Smart-Pig caps the amount of interest and 
charges on its loans at 50% of the amount borrowed, irrespective of when the loans were 
due to be repaid.  And the repayments were structured to coincide with Mr Ns grant 
payments. But in Mr Ns case Ive found proportionate checks wouldve likely  shown that the 
loans were unaffordable, based on the repayment  amount.  And also that for loan 4 onwards, 
Smart-Pig should reasonably have seen that further  lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise 
harmful. So I dont think the loan structure makes  a difference in Mr Ns case.
Im therefore  upholding Mr Ns complaint about all of his loans.
putting things right  what Smart-Pig needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr N paid on all of his loans;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 1 to 3 from Mr Ns credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 4 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 4 to 8 should be removed from 
Mr Ns credit file.
Ref: DRN40876915 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Smart-Pig to take off tax from this interest.  Smart-Pig  must  give 
Mr N a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Mr Ns complaint.  FCL Consumer Finance Ltd 
must put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 June 2019.
