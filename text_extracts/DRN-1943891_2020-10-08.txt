The complaint
Mr S is unhappy Barclays Bank Plc (Barclays) wont refund several online banking 
transfers made from his account, that Mr S says he didnt authorise.
 
What happened
Mr S says he lost his keys and Barclays bank card, reporting this on 23 or 24 March 2020. 
Mr S says on 26 March 2020 he was staying at his mothers house. When Mr S went to his 
mothers house on 26 March 2020, she wasnt in and he didnt have keys to the property. 
Mr S says he went to the shops and saw some friends who explained he could stay with 
them.
Shortly after midnight, Mr S says his friend asked him for some money. As Mr S didnt have 
his Barclays bank card on him, Mr S says he transferred £250 from his Barclays account via 
online banking to his Lloyds account that he did have a card for. Mr S says he then went to a 
cash machine a minute away from his friends house which wasnt working. Mr S says he 
then returned back to his friends house. This took, according to Mr S, around five minutes. 
Mr S says he had left his mobile phone at his friends while he went to the cash machine. 
Mr S says when he returned to his friends house his phone was on the table. Mr S says he 
was given a drink and doesnt remember anything that happened afterwards. Mr S says 
when he awoke in the morning, he left his friends house went to the shops and the went to 
his mothers where he slept as he was unwell.
While Mr S was asleep at his friends house, there were several transfers made through his 
online banking app on his mobile device.

Mr S said he noticed some notifications/alerts regarding the payments on his phone after he 
had left his friends house and was at the shop the next day. Mr S says he logged into the 
banking application and deleted it after noticing the transactions.
Mr S got in touch with Barclays about the payment transfers that he says he hadnt 
consented to or authorised.
Mr S says his friend knew the pass code to his mobile phone, which was also the pass code 
to his banking application. Mr S also said that his friend probably saw him enter his pass 
code when he transferred money from his Barclays account to his other account before he 
went to the cash machine.
Barclays looked into the matter and considered the transfers were all made via online 
banking through a mobile device registered to Mr S. Barclays say the mobile banking app 
was accessed via either biometrics (face/touch ID) or with the correct passcode. As Mr S 
had said that only he knew the passcode and the passcode hadnt been written down 
anywhere, and as the device was in Mr Ss possession at the time of the transfers, Barclays 
said that it couldnt see any way to show the passcode had been compromised. So Barclays 
said it considered Mr S was liable for the transfers. 
Unhappy, Mr S referred the matter to our service. One of our investigators looked into the 
complaint and didnt uphold it. They considered the Internet Providers (I.P) address  
which shows the location from which the internet and online banking was accessed  didnt 
align with Mr Ss version of what had happened. The last disputed transfer occurred at 
10:08am  and this had a different I.P address to the transactions made between midnight 
and up to 10 am. The I.P address at 10:08 was also the same I.P address that Mr S used to 
log in later on in the day at 17:33pm  when Mr S said he was back at his mothers. Broadly 
summarised they considered the evidence strongly suggested that the transactions were 
authorised by Mr S and no-one else. 
Mr S in response to the investigators opinion, changed his version of events. Mr S said that 
when he transferred money to his Lloyds account at 00:40am, he was told by his friend that 
the cash machine wasnt working. Mr S said he didnt go to the cash machine like he had 
previously said. Instead Mr S says he did transfer £320 to his friend at 00:44am. So Mr S 
wasnt now disputing this first transaction. Mr S simply said that he doesnt remember 
anything after this transaction. And when Mr S woke up, he says went to the shops and then 
went to his mothers house and fell asleep. Mr S says he then went into a branch on 28 
March 2020 and deleted the app and hadnt deleted on the 27 March 2020 like he had said 
previously.
Mr S believes his friends used his finger to access his phone and online banking app while 
he was sleeping. 
As Mr S disagreed with the investigators opinion, and as the matter hasnt been resolved, 
its been passed to me for a final decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, my review of the evidence has led me to the same overall conclusions as 
the investigator previously set out, and for much the same reasons. Ill explain why.
When considering whats fair and reasonable I am required to take into account; relevant law 
and regulations; the regulators rules, guidance and standards; codes of practice; and where 
appropriate what I consider to have been good industry practice at the relevant time.The relevant regulations in place at the time are the Payment Services Regulations 2017 
(PSR 2017).
PSR 2017 says a payment transaction is regarded as authorised if the payer has given 
consent to the execution of the payment transaction. And if a payment service user 
(customer) denied having authorised an executed payment  the payment service provider 
(in this case Barclays) has to prove the payment transaction was authenticated. And if it is 
deemed that a payment transaction hasnt been consented to, it isnt authorised. 
PSR 2017 goes on to say a payment service provider is required to refund the amount of an 
unauthorised transaction to the payer.
Mr S says he didnt consent or authorise the transfers and is seeking a refund of the 
transfers made from his account. Barclays say it considers the evidence suggest the 
transfers were made by Mr S and he is therefore liable for them. 
So, I need to think about whether the evidence I have suggests the payment was 
authenticated and whether its more likely than not Mr S, or somebody with his knowledge 
or authority, carried out the transfer Mr S is now disputing.
The disputed transfers  were they authenticated?
Ive looked at the technical evidence provided by Barclays. The disputed transfers were 
made through online banking. And the evidence shows this was accessed through Mr Ss 
registered mobile device, with Mr Ss biometrics (touch ID) or pass code being entered to 
gain access to the online banking app and make the transfers. 
So Im satisfied from Barclays technical evidence that Mr Ss registered mobile device was 
used when the disputed transfers were made, and that the transfers were authenticated as 
Mr Ss biometrics or pass code were entered to access the online banking app. 
This means I now need to determine whether Mr S, or somebody with his knowledge or 
authority, carried out the transfers.
Were the transfers made without Mr Ss consent?
Having carefully considered Mr Ss testimony  it hasnt been consistent; Mr S has changed 
his version of what happened considerably. I also dont consider his versions of the events to 
be plausible. 
Mr S initially said he transferred money to another account and went to the cash machine to 
withdraw the money for his friend, leaving his phone at his friends house in the process. 
Mr S thinks his friends identified his pass code when he made the transfer from his Barclays 
account to his other account. 
So Mr S thought his friends identified his passcode when he made the transfer at 00:40am. 
But Mr S has also said that his friend who was there knew the pass code to his mobile 
phone, which was also the pass code to his online banking app. And Im also mindful Mr S 
had previously said to Barclays that no-one knew his pass code.Ive looked at the technical evidence provided by Barclays to see what I think most likely 
happened. The technical evidence provided by Barclays show the transaction made at 
00:40am, for £250, which Mr S says was him transferring money from his Barclays account 
to his other account, was made with Mr S using biometrics (touch ID) to log on to his banking 
app. 
So I cant say Mr Ss pass code had been identified at this time as Mr S has suggested. Mr S 
hadnt used his pass code at 00:40am to access his online banking meaning that his friends 
couldnt have accessed his online banking app at 00:44am using the pass code while Mr S 
was going to the cash machine  without his phone. I also say this because the evidence 
shows that the online transfer at 00:44am, while Mr S says he was at the cash machine, was 
accessed using biometrics  not a pass code. So Mr S had to be physically present at 
0:44am and not at the cash machine.
Mr S then changed his version of events  and said that he didnt get go to the cash machine 
as his friend had informed him it wasnt working. Mr S said he did actually transfer the first 
disputed payment of £320 at 00:44am. This is a considerable change in the version of 
events and what happened and brings into serious question the legitimacy of Mr Ss 
testimony. 
Mr S says he simply doesnt remember anything after the transfer of £320 at 00:44am. Mr S 
has alluded to possibly being drugged as he fell asleep quickly and didnt wake up again 
until the morning. Mr S thinks his friends used his finger to access his phone and banking 
app.
I dont think Mr Ss version of events are plausible here either. The first three transfers (at 
00:40am, 00:44am and 02:49am) were all conducted with Mr S biometrics (touch ID) being 
used to gain access to the app. 
But the following four transfers transactions (at 04:52am, 05:54am, 06:56am and 08:02am)
were all completed using Mr Ss pass code, not through biometrics (touch ID). As Mr S had 
used touch ID for the earlier transfers  then it seems to me that his pass code couldnt have 
been seen by his friends and compromised. It hadnt been used. And if Mr S was asleep, as 
he says, then this means his friends would have successfully had to have guessed his pass 
code which I think is unlikely. And if Mr Ss friends knew his pass code, as Mr S has also 
suggested at times, then I question why they would use Mr Ss finger to gain access online 
for an earlier transfer at 02:49 when Mr S was asleep, when they could simply use the pass 
code if they knew it; and not run the risk waking Mr S up.
Also, with opportunistic theft and fraud, its typical for the fraudster to try and transfer as 
much from an account as quickly as possible  maximising the amount they could obtain. 
This didnt happen here. As can be seen by the times of the transfers, amounts were sent 
over a period of time. If somebody had wanted to obtain money from Mr S  I think they 
would have tried to transfer considerably more  and in a considerably quicker timescale  in 
case Mr S woke at any point.
That aside, I also have to bear in mind, that Barclays technical evidence shows where the 
mobile device was logged on from - so the IP address or location. This is important in this 
case, as every time Mr Ss mobile banking app was logged into  the internets providers 
location was recorded. This evidence shows:

The first seven transfers / log-ins from 00:35am up until 06:56am took place from the same 
IP address (I.P address XX.XX.170.75)  meaning they happened from the same location. 
This location, according to Mr S, was his friends house. But then the online banking app 
was accessed from a different location at 08:02am with a transfer being made and then 
another different location again at 10:08am for a further transfer. All transfers went to the 
same beneficiary account that Mr S is disputing authorising transfers to.
Importantly, the location of the device login at 10:08am is the same location that Mr S logged 
on from later on in the day at 17:33pm (I.P address XXX.XX.165.146). Mr S says he had left 
his friends around midday. This clearly isnt true because had Mr S left his friends house at 
around mid-day, then the IP address for the log in at 10:08am would have been the same as 
the earlier IP address (IP address XX.XX.170.75)  that of his friends house. 
At the time Mr S logged on at 17:33pm, Mr S says he had returned to his mothers house. 
The I.P address location for this log on at 17:33pm was XXX.XX.165.146 and this is the 
same IP address (location) as the disputed transfer made at 10:08am that Mr S says was 
made without his authorisation at his friends house. The IP address location clearly shows 
that the disputed transfer Mr S says was made at 10:08 was from the same location Mr S 
was at later in the day  which Mr S says was when he was at his mothers house.
Overall, Mr S hasnt provided any plausible, credible testimony as to what happened. Indeed 
Mr S has changed his version of the events considerably and on multiple occasions. This 
causes me to seriously doubt the validity of Mr Ss testimony. Im mindful that Mr S has tried 
to change his story as to what happened, seemingly to fit the evidence as presented to him 
by our investigator. But the technical evidence provided by Barclays, as Ive explained 
above, shows that things couldnt have happened as Mr S has tried to say they did. And 
when Mr S changed his version of what had happened  the evidence didnt support this 
either.
Taking everything into consideration, its hard for me to see how somebody other than Mr S, 
carried out the transfers Mr S is now disputing. So, I dont think it would be fair or reasonable 
to ask Barclays to reimburse him.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 November 2020.
