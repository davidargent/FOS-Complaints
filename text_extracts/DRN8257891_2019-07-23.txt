K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as Quick Quid) gave him loans  that he 
couldnt afford to repay. He asks that it refunds interest and charges and removes 
information about the loans from his credit file.
background
Mr S took out six loans  and a number of top ups with Quick  Quid between  May 2017 and 
August 2018.
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld. She said Quick  Quid 
wasnt wrong to offer loans 1 and 2. But it shouldnt have offered  the top up to loan 2 or the 
later loans. The adjudicator said the repayment for loan 2 with the top up was a significant  
proportion of Mr Ss monthly  income. And by the time he took out loan 3 his pattern of 
borrowing suggested he was reliant  on the loans. 
Quick Quid didnt agree. It said the number of loans  isnt enough  to demonstrate  that the 
loans were unsustainable. It asked for evidence that each loan was unsustainable and that 
detriment was caused as a result. Quick  Quid says its own checks didnt reveal anything to 
suggest Mr S would struggle with his repayments. It said loans  2 to 6 were repayable  over 
two periods so Mr S would accrue income to meet the last repayment. It said there  were  
gaps between the loans. Quick Quid said there was nothing to suggest it shouldnt  rely on 
the income and expenditure  information  Mr S provided.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Quick Quid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
Mr Ss income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.

***Quick Quids records suggest this payment was late was due to a technical  problem
Loans 1 and 2
When Mr S applied  for loan 1 he told Quick Quid his monthly income was about  £1,740.  He 
said his monthly outgoings  were  about £325. Following its credit check, Quick  Quid 
estimated Mr S had disposable monthly  income of £1,283. I dont think Quick  Quid  had any 
reason to think loan 1 wasnt  affordable.
When Mr S took out loan 2 he told Quick Quid his monthly income was about £1,600 and his 
outgoings were  £375.  Quick Quids  credit  check suggested Mr S had credit commitments 
due of about £948. It estimated he had monthly disposable income  of £562. Loan 2 was 
repayable in two payments of £33 and £430. Based on the information it had, I dont think  
Quick Quid had any reason to think loan 2 wasnt affordable.
When Mr S took out the top up of loan 2, the largest repayment due was £795.  This was a 
significant proportionate of Mr Ss monthly  income  and over £200 more than Quick Quids 
estimate of his disposable income. Quick Quid says loan 2 was repayable  over two periods, 
so Mr S could accrue income to meet the last repayment. Mr S owed  about  £845: this 
suggests Quick  Quid  expected him to set aside up to about  £420 in October to help with the 
larger repayment due in November. Mr S took out loan 2 in mid October and topped  it up 
about a week  later. This could suggest he was having problems managing his money. I dont 
think, in the circumstances,  it was reasonable for Quick Quid  to assume  hed be able to set 
enough money aside in October to help with the payment in November.
Quick Quid could have  made further checks to ensure the repayment was sustainable. It 
could have asked  Mr S for evidence to support what he told it about his outgoings   
especially as its credit check  suggested the information he gave  about  his credit 
Ref: DRN82578913commitments wasnt accurate. There are different ways of doing this. One is to ask for bank 
statements.
Mr Ss bank  statements  show  he was overdrawn by an amount in excess  of his monthly  
income. He had loans  from other short term lenders and there are payments to online 
gambling sites. So I think if Quick Quid had made further checks it would have known it was 
unlikely Mr S would  be able to repay this loan sustainably.
Loans 3 to 6
I think when Mr S asked for loan 3 Quick Quid should have realised  further lending  was 
unsustainable. By this time, Mr S had been borrowing from Quick Quid  for about seven 
months without a significant break.  He deferred  repayment of loan 2 and took out loan 3 
soon after repaying  loan 2. Quick Quid ought to have realised Mr S was having  to borrow  to 
cover the gap in his finances left by repaying his previous  loan.
The loans offered by Quick Quid  were  intended for short term use. But Mr S didnt make any 
real inroads  into the amount he owed  Quick Quid.  He took out loan 6 in August 2018, more 
than a year after his first loan. And, with the top ups, he borrowed £1,250  a significantly 
larger amount than his first loan. In effect,  Mr S paid large amounts of interest to service a 
debt to Quick Quid  over an extended  period.  I dont  think this borrowing was sustainable.
So Im upholding  Mr Ss complaint about  the top up of loan 2, loan 3 and the later loans and 
top ups. Quick  Quid should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on the top up of loan 2, loan 3 and the later 
loans and top ups;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove adverse entries  about  the top up of loan 2 from Mr Ss credit file; and
remove all entries about  loan 3 and the later loans and top ups from Mr Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Quick Quid to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. I order CashEuroNet  UK LLC to take the steps 
and make the payments set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 August 2019.
