Mr M has said Sunny provided him with loans that were unaffordable. He has said had better 
checks been done Sunny would have seen he was in financial difficulty. Sunny said it 
undertakes eligibility, creditworthiness and affordability checks for all loan applications. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ms complaint in part and thought loans 4 to 19 should not have 
been given. Sunny didnt agree but it make an offer for loans 13 to 19. Mr M didnt accept the 
offer so the complaint has now been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr M could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
    the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
    the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);     the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr M could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ms complaint.
Mr M hasnt disagreed with our adjudicators opinion on loans 1 to 3 and loans 20 to 23 so I 
wont be looking at these any further as there is no ongoing disagreement about them. But I 
will bear them in mind when Im looking at Mr Ms other lending. 
By the time loan 4 was taken, Mr M was paying for three other loans (loans 1 to 3) with
Sunny at the same time. Loan 4 was taken in quick succession after the first three loans
and only two months after loan 1 was taken. While loan 4 was for a lower amount compared 
to loans 1 to 3, Sunny should have been concerned with Mr Ms borrowing pattern by the 
time loan 4 was taken and should have realised that he was having problems managing 
money.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr M, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ms case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
10. I say this because:
    At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr M was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr Ms overall pattern of borrowing suggested that he had become 
persistently reliant on short-term loans. Mr M had taken out 10 loans within eight 
months and Mr M had been indebted to Sunny for months. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr M was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ms 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
    Mr Ms first loan was for £300 and loan 10 was for £250. While the amounts 
borrowed had fluctuated, they hadnt decreased. At this point Sunny ought to have known that Mr M was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in their income 
but to meet an ongoing need. 
    From loan onwards Mr M was provided with a new loan within days of settling a 
previous one, or in some cases, while the previous loan was still outstanding. 
    Mr M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 19 was 
taken out 14 months after Mr Ms first. Mr M had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Mr M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 10 
onwards because:
    these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ms indebtedness by allowing 
him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
    the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr M borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ms ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding the complaint about loans 4 to 9 and loans 10 to 19 and Sunny should put 
things right.
Putting things right
    refund all interest and charges Mr M paid on loans 4 to 19;
    pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement;
    remove any negative information about loans 4 to 9 from Mr Ms credit file;
    the number of loans taken from loan 10 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loan 10 to 19 should be removed from Mr 
Ms credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 April 2020.
