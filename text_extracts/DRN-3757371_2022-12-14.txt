DRN-3757371
The complaint
Mr D complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) took the decision to close 
his accounts with it and failed to ensure he knew about the account closures.
What happened
Mr D who resides out of the United Kingdom held a bank account with NatWest. Following a 
review of Mr Ds banking arrangements NatWest took the decision to close Mr Ds account 
and sent notice of this to the residential address it had on file on 14 February 2022. 
In early May 2022 Mr D complained to NatWest that he never received this letter as he cant 
receive mail to that address. His address for correspondence was a PO Box address. 
As Mr D had asked NatWest to send mail to a PO Box address and NatWest had previously 
done so it acknowledged its error and compensated Mr D £100 and delayed the closure of 
the account until 23 May 2022 to allow Mr D time to transfer his funds.
Mr D was dis-satisfied with this and brought his complaint to this service. One of our 
adjudicators looked into Mr Ds concerns and reached the conclusion that NatWest had 
closed Mr Ds accounts in line with the terms and conditions of the account and didnt think 
NatWest had treated Mr D unfairly. 
Mr D disagreed and has asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My role is to look at the problems Mr D has experienced and see if NatWest has done 
anything wrong. If it has, I would seek  if possible - to put Mr D back in the position he 
wouldve been in if the mistakes hadnt happened. And I may award modest compensation 
that I think is fair and reasonable.
As has already been explained by our adjudicator as a general rule NatWest isnt obliged to 
continue offering an account to a customer if it doesnt want to and it doesnt have to give a 
reason  providing banking facilities and to who is a commercial decision and not something 
for me to get involved with.
That being said it wouldnt be fair for NatWest to close Mr Ds account outside the terms and 
conditions of the account or without reasonable notice.
The terms and conditions of the account say that NatWest is able to close an account 
immediately in certain circumstances or providing at least 60 days notice is given. 
NatWest sent notice to Mr D about the closure of his account on 14 February 2022. This was 
sent to the residential address it had on file and not the PO Box address Mr D had provided. 
NatWest admitted this was an error on its part and gave Mr D an extension on the notice 
period and paid him £100 for the inconvenience caused.
So given NatWest gave Mr D what I consider a reasonable an extension on the notice period 
for the closure of his account I think NatWest has put Mr D in the position he wouldve been 
in if it hadnt made an error as well as compensating him £100 for the inconvenience which I 
think is fair and reasonable.
I understand Mr D feels strongly that NatWest shouldve made sure he knew of the 
impending account closure. But we are not the regulator, I cannot make NatWest change its 
systems or processes  such as how accounts are closed. We offer an informal dispute 
resolution service and we have no regulatory or disciplinary role. But in saying that I think 
given the continuing movement of the millions of NatWest customers around the world and 
changes in contact details, it wouldnt be practical to follow up on every communication it has 
with its customers. 
So after considering everything I think NatWest treated Mr D fairly and I dont think NatWest 
needs to do anything more. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained Ive decided not to uphold Mr Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 January 2023.
