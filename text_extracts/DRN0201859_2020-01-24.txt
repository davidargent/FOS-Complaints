K821x#15complaint
Mr G says PDL Finance Limited, trading as Mr Lender (PDL) irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about six instalment loans PDL provided to Mr G between September  2014 
and October 2016.  Mr Gs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date  Repaid Instalments Amount Highest 
repayment
1 25/09/2014 31/10/2014 2 £180.00 £121.50
2 31/10/2014 30/04/2015 6 £510.00 £238.00
3 02/05/2015 29/01/2016 6 £400.00 £156.26
4 04/02/2016 07/03/2016 6 £750.00 £280.00
5 21/03/2016 30/09/2016 6 £300.00 £143.60
6 01/10/2016 19/10/2017 6 £450.00 £183.00
Mr G has said not enough checks were completed when the loans were taken. PDL has said 
it carried out the appropriate checks before the loans were provided.  
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Gs complaint and thought  the loans from 4 to 6 shouldnt  have  
been given. PDL disagreed and the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
PDL needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that PDL should fairly and reasonably  have done  
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN02018592There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that PDL was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
Mr G hasnt disagreed with our adjudicators assessment of loans 1 to 3 so I wont be 
considering these loans any further  because they are no longer in dispute. But I have kept 
these loans in mind when thinking  about the overall  lending relationship  between  Mr G and 
PDL.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of PDLs  lending history with Mr G, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which PDL should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so PDL should have realised that it shouldnt  have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
4. I say this because by loan 4, Mr Gs overall  pattern of borrowing suggested that he had 
become persistently reliant on short-term loans.  Mr G had borrowed on four occasions  in 17 
months and whilst the amounts fluctuated, they didnt significantly decrease over this period 
and for the rest of the borrowing relationship  with PDL. There was little or no gap between 
the loans also indicating that there was a problem. So PDL ought to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr G was having  to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying  his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Gs indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
In my view, the pattern  of lending itself shows that the loans from loan 4 were unsustainable. 
So, I dont think that PDL should  have  given Mr G loans  4 to 6. Mr G wasnt  making  any real 
inroads to the amount  he owed PDL. Loan  6 was taken almost two years after Mr G first 
borrowed from PDL. Mr G had paid large  amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to 
PDL over an extended period.
I think that Mr G lost out because PDL continued  to provide borrowing from loan 4 onwards 
because these loans  had the effect  of unfairly  prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness  by allowing 
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period  of time. 
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to have  
Ref: DRN02018593had negative implications  on Mr Gs ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in 
the market for these  high-cost  loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 to 6 and PDL should put things  right.
putting things right  what PDL needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 4 to 6;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 4 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loan 4 to 6 should be removed from       
Mr Gs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires PDL to take off tax from this interest.  PDL must give     
Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. PDL Finance  Limited  
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2020.
