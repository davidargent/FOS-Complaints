The complaint
Mr S complains that Vanquis Bank Limited (Vanquis) lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr S had a credit card from Vanquis since 2012. His credit limit was increased four times  
in January 2013, June 2013, November 2013 and October 2015. The last increase was from 
£2000 to £2500. In September 2020 the account was passed to a debt collection agency.
Mr S complained that Vanquis couldnt have carried out sufficient checks before increasing 
his limits. Each time, hed been over his limits prior to the increases. He couldnt afford to 
borrow the money. He wants a refund of all interest plus 8% per annum simple interest 
added. He was now suffering from stress and poor health.
Vanquis said they couldnt look at the first issue of the card in 2012  as this was more than 
six years before Mr S complaint. But theyd completed all their checks before each increase 
in limit. Their searches showed no new CCJs or newly defaulted debt. Total external debt 
was £12119 at the time of the increase in 2015. All minimum payments had been made. Mr 
S couldve opted out of the increases - but didnt.
Mr S brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said we couldnt look at the issue of the 
card in 2012, nor the increases in limit up to November 2013  because we can only look at 
complaints brought to a business within six years of the event taking place. And as Mr S 
complained to Vanquis in November 2020, we could only look at the increase from £2000 to 
£2500 in October 2015. She issued her view on this aspect  Mr S didnt have any 
comments. Looking at the increase to £2500 in October 2015, she thought that Vanquis 
shouldnt have offered this. Mr S had been over his limit of £2000 in each month between 
January 2015 and April 2015. And his other debts had gone up from £2990 in November 
2014 to £12119 in October 2015  a considerable increase. So, Vanquis didnt make the 
necessary and proportionate checks needed. She said Vanquis should refund all interest 
paid by Mr S on the debt above £2000 up until it was passed to the DCA. This should be 
used to reduce his debt with the DCA.
Vanquis accepted this recommendation and calculated the refund of interest would be 
£518.57. Mr S didnt accept this  he said the refund should be about £850, including over-
limit fees. And  he wanted any over-limit information on his credit file in connection with the 
increase removed.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 All lenders have an obligation to lend money responsibly. We have to check whether 
Vanquis acted in line within the Financial Conducts (FCA) rules on creditworthiness 
assessment as set out in its handbook, (CONC) section 5.2. These say that a firm must 
undertake a reasonable assessment of creditworthiness, considering both the risk to it of the 
customer not making the repayments, as well as the risk to the customer of not being able to 
make repayments.
Mr S has told us about the bad luck hes suffered in the last few years, and I have every 
sympathy with whats happened to him. But equally, I must reach a balanced decision based 
on all the circumstances of his complaint.
For the reasons given by our investigator, I will only consider the increase in Mr S limit in 
October 2015  from £2000 to £2500. I agree that Vanquis shouldve carried out more 
checks before offering Mr S the increase  but I can also see that there was some 
justification for what they did. And, it appears that a lot of Mr Ss financial problems arose 
sometime after October 2015  and this affects how I think this complaint should be settled.
I agree that on balance, Vanquis shouldve made more enquiries before increasing Mr S 
limit in October 2015. There were warning signs  his total external debts had gone up a lot 
 from £2990 in November 2014 to £12119 on October 2015. And  I can see that Mr S went 
over his previous limit of £2000 each month between January 2015 and April 2015. But  to 
be fair to Vanquis, I can also see that Mr S paid off most of the credit card borrowing in May 
2015 and June 2015, and the account operated well after that  the balances were low and 
monthly payments made - up to the end of 2015 and into 2016. So  in the three months 
prior to the increase, things looked OK.
I can also see that Mr Ss other debts went up quickly later - after the increase:
Date Total external debt
December 2016 £18736
December 2017 £17571
December 2018 £21650
December 2019 £25404
December 2020 £27406
 
So  it looks to me as if Mr S financial problems got much worse after Vanquis increased his 
limit in October 2015  as he was borrowing a lot more money after that from other lenders - 
so what Im saying is that Vanquis cant be responsible for everything that happened after 
that time. So  this affects how I think Vanquis should be asked to put things right.
Putting things rightI agree that Vanquis should refund the interest on Mr S debt over the previous limit of £2000 
from October 2015 to when the account was passed to the DCA in October 2020  as I 
assume that no interest was charged after that time anyway. But  on balance here - I dont 
think they should refund over limit fees  because a lot of Mr S problems came to light later. 
And  Vanquis, like all lenders, must report accurate data to the credit reference agencies. 
And so, any information put on Mr S credit file should stand, and for the same reasons as 
Ive given. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. Vanquis Bank Limited must:
Refund interest on Mr S debt above £2000 from October 2015 to when the account 
was passed to the debt collection agency in September 2020. This to be refunded as 
a credit to the debt.
Confirm that no interest was applied after September 2020  if it was, this should 
also be refunded to reduce the debt with the debt collection agency.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 August 2021.
