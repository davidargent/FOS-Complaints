K820x#14complaint
Mr W complains that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited  (trading as Audi Finance) 
misrepresented his finance  agreement.
background
Mr W bought a car using  a hire purchase  agreement from Audi Finance in January 2018 
which he says was agreed verbally.  He says that when he was considering part-exchanging 
the car in November  2018 he discovered his outstanding balance was significantly higher 
than he expected, that the car was on a lease plan and that Audi Finance had revalued it to 
his detriment. He adds that Audi Finance was unable to provide a signed copy of the 
agreement. Mr W wants  the contract to reflect the verbal agreement  he made at the point of 
sale or for his existing  contract to be annulled  and to receive  appropriate compensation.
Audi Finance provided a signed  copy of the hire purchase agreement and calculations  to 
support the outstanding balance in November  2018.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. He was satisfied Mr W 
had entered into a hire purchase agreement  and the figures hed been  quoted  were  correct.
Mr W responded to say, in summary,  that the assessment wasnt  sufficiently  explained.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Nature of the agreement
Mr W says he agreed to enter into a hire purchase agreement at the point of sale, only to 
later find out it was a lease plan. He says hed never  have part-exchanged  his car had he 
known it was a lease plan and it made no sense to have a second hand  car on a lease plan.
I have seen the agreement provided by Audi Finance and Im satisfied it is indeed a hire 
purchase agreement,  rather  than a lease plan. I acknowledge Mr W says Audi Finance 
initially could  not provide  a signed copy of the agreement, but the copy  I have now seen  is 
signed. I have  also compared the signature with the one that Mr W submitted from his 
driving licence  and I have no reason to doubt  that the signature on the agreement is his.
Balance of the account
The cost of Mr Ws car was £13,899. He part-exchanged  his existing car for £3,200, leaving 
a balance to pay of £10,699 which was to be financed through the hire purchase  agreement.  
The annual percentage rate (APR) on the agreement was 10.7% which  meant Mr W would 
have ended up paying a total of £13,699.80 with 60 instalments of £228.33, plus the £10 
purchase fee. I acknowledge that Mr W was aware of the APR and is not disputing that.
Mr W paid his £228.33 instalments between February  and June and then paid a lump  sum of 
£3,000. After this his instalments reduced to £159.75. So, when Mr W asked for his 
outstanding balance in November 2018, hed also paid five further instalments of £159.75. 
He says the £7,997.50  he was quoted was significantly  higher than hed expected.

Initial Balance £13,699.80
Purchase fee £10.00
Less payments Feb 2018 to Jun 2018: 5 x £228.33 (£1,141.65)
Balance June 2018  before additional  payment £12,568.15
Additional payment (£3,000)
Interest saving due to additional payment (771.90)*
Balance June 2018  after additional  payment £8,796.25
Less payments Jul 2018 to Nov 2018: 5 x £159.75 (£798.75)
Balance November  2018 £7,997.50
* This saving is due to less interest  being charged over the term of the agreement  
as a result  of the £3,000  reduction in the balance. Audi Finance has provided a 
calculation for this, with which I am satisfied.
So I can understand why Mr W thought  the outstanding balance  was high in November 2018 
- the cost of the car was £13,899,  hed received  £3,200 for his part-exchange  and paid a 
further £3,000 lump  sum plus ten instalments. But Im satisfied  the calculation  was correct as 
outlined in the table above.
For all the above  reasons,  I cant conclude Audi Finance has done  anything wrong.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 May 2020.
