The complaint
Mrs K complains about delays by PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) releasing a 
payment she received. Mrs K also complains about the way PayPal handled her enquiries. 
What happened
On 11 January 2021 Mrs K received a payment of Â£39.25 into her PayPal account having 
sold an item via an online auction site. When the payment wasnt released, Mrs K contacted 
PayPal via its online chat facility. Mrs Ks enquires initially received automated responses. 
One of the responses explained the payment was being reviewed and that the latest release 
date was 1 February 2021. 
During online chats with PayPal Mrs K said the item had been delivered on 15 January 2021 
and that the hold on the payment should be removed. An advisor at PayPal asked Mrs K to 
provide a tracking number that showed the item had been delivered. But when checking with 
the carrier, PayPal found there was no record of the item being delivered. 
The payment was released on 1 February 2021, at the end of the 21 day hold period. 
Mrs K complained but PayPal didnt agree it had made a mistake. The complaint was 
referred to our service and passed to an investigator. They thought PayPal had dealt with 
Mrs Ks complaint fairly and didnt ask it to do anything else. Mrs K asked to appeal, so her 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal says it placed a transaction hold on this payment because it needed confirmation 
that the item Mrs K had sold was received by the buyer. I understand this is normally an 
automated process that takes is completed far quicker. But PayPal has explained the 
delivery tracking number failed to show the item was delivered so it didnt remove the hold 
for the full 21 day period. Ive checked the tracking number PayPal asked for and it doesnt 
confirm delivery. 
I appreciate Mrs K was in regular contact with PayPal during this time and that she found the 
responses and service received frustrating. The automated responses provided didnt cover 
the full issues raised. Mrs K was able to then discuss the issue with PayPals agents via its 
chat facility. I agree that some of the information provided about the exact reason behind the 
transaction block wasnt right. But it was explained that a tracking number showing the item 
as delivered would be sufficient to remove the transaction block. Whilst I agree some of the 
service provided couldve been better, I havent found grounds to tell PayPal to compensate 
Mrs K for the way her enquiries were handled. 
As the tracking number Mrs K provided didnt confirm the item as delivered, the transaction 
was released after 21 days. Ive checked PayPals user agreement and it allows it to place a 
hold on a payment to investigate it. Im satisfied thats what PayPal did in this case. 
Im sorry to disappoint Mrs K but I havent been persuaded it was unfair of PayPal to place a 
hold on the payment or request evidence of receipt by way of a delivery tracking number. As 
the tracking number provided didnt give the required information PayPal waited 21 days to 
release the transaction, in line with its process. Im satisfied that was fair in the 
circumstances of Mrs Ks complaint.
 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ks complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 April 2022.
