The complaint
Mrs P complains that Harvey & Thompson Limited lent irresponsibly to her. 
What happened
Between October 2011 and March 2013, Mrs P borrowed seven loans from Harvey & 
Thompson. The lending history is set out below: 
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Max repayment
1 19/10/2011 31/10/2011 1 £100.00 £113.00
2 28/10/2011 31/01/2012 1 £250.00 £298.25
3 09/02/2012 29/02/2012 1 £200.00 £220.00
4 22/05/2012 29/06/2012 1 £350.00 £369.25
5 22/08/2012 28/09/2012 1 £100.00 £115.88
6 14/02/2013 28/02/2013 1 £100.00 £109.94
7 28/03/2013 29/04/2013 1 £250.00 £299.63
In his view letter, our adjudicator said that loan 2 had been repaid in November 2011. 
However, the information provided by Harvey & Thompson indicates that this loan may have 
been rolled over on two occasions before being repaid in January 2012. 
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should have been upheld in respect of loans 4 to 7. 
He thought it should have been clear by that point that Mrs P was struggling financially and 
spending a lot on online gambling websites. 
Harvey & Thompson disagreed with that view. It made reference to the time lapse between 
the loans and also said that checks as to gambling transactions wouldnt have been 
undertaken when Mrs P applied for this borrowing. 
As the parties are not in agreement with our adjudicator, the matter has been passed to me 
to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Harvey and Thompson needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend 
irresponsibly. In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to 
make sure Mrs P could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take 
into account a number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment 
amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages 
of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Harvey & Thompson should fairly and 
reasonably have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Harvey & Thompson was required to 
establish whether Mrs P could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan 
payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ps complaint. Having done so, I think our 
adjudicator was right when he said that Harvey & Thompson shouldnt have agreed to lend 
loans 4 to 7. 
Neither party disagreed with what our adjudicator said in respect of loans 1 to 3. On that 
basis, I havent considered further whether Harvey & Thompson was irresponsible to agree 
those loans. I have kept the circumstances in mind though when looking at loans 4 to 7. 
By the time Mrs P applied for loan 4, I think Harvey & Thompson should have been on notice 
that she was struggling financially. I say this because it knew she had ostensibly rolled over 
her repayments for loan 2 on two occasions and the amount she was borrowing had more than trebled in the space of three months  it had increased from £100 to £350 during that 
time. 
Given that Harvey & Thompson should have been appreciated Mrs P may have been in 
financial trouble when she applied for loan 4, I think it should have undertaken a full review 
of her financial circumstances. Had that review been undertaken, I think Harvey & 
Thompson would have seen that Mrs P was spending significant sums each month on online 
betting sites. I think it would have been very clear that loan 4 was not sustainably affordable. 
Given what have highlighted above, I think Harvey & Thompson should have undertaken 
similar checks in respect of loans 5 to 7. And for the same reasons, I think it would have 
seen that Mrs P could not repay these loans without borrowing further. 
I have thought about what Harvey & Thompson said about there being gaps in between the 
borrowing. I dont view those gaps as sufficient to indicate a new chain of borrowing. So for 
effectively the same reasons as set out by our adjudicator, I am upholding this complaint in 
respect of loans 4 to 7. Harvey & Thompson will need to take action to put things right as set 
out below.  
Putting things right
Harvey & Thompson must: 
refund all interest and charges Mrs P paid on loans 4 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4 to 7 from Mrs Ps credit file. I 
appreciate more than six years have passed since these loans were repaid, so it may 
well be that no information about these loans remains on the credit file. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Harvey & Thompson to take off tax from this interest. 
Harvey & Thompson must give Mrs P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she 
asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partly upholding this complaint. Harvey & Thompson 
Limited will need to put things right as set out above.  Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs P to accept or reject my decision before 5 
October 2020.
