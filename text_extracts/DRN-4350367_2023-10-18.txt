The complaint
Mr N complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked his accounts twice without 
providing an explanation. Mr N is also unhappy with the customer service NatWest provided 
him when it blocked his accounts. He says this caused him unnecessary inconvenience and 
worry for which he should be compensated.
What happened
Mr N had a number of accounts with NatWest. 
On 30 December 2021, Mr N visited a branch to arrange a bankers draft. NatWest asked 
Mr N some questions about his request and told him to come back the next day when the 
draft would be issued. Unhappy with how he was treated, Mr N decided to visit a different 
branch the following day to see if he could get the draft issued. However, when he arrived at 
the other branch staff told him that his accounts were being reviewed and had been blocked. 
Mr Ns accounts were blocked until 11 January 2022. 
Mr N asked NatWest for an explanation, but the bank wouldnt give him much information. 
Mr N says NatWest made him feel like a criminal by asking him lots of questions. He also 
said that NatWest didnt call him back after promising to do so, and he was passed from 
pillar to post each time he contacted NatWest, which added to his upset and frustration. And 
he had to go into branch more than once to try and sort things out. So, Mr N complained to 
NatWest.
At the time Mr N was away from home staying in a different part of the country with relatives. 
He says NatWest told him to stay in the area to sort things out with his accounts and that 
during a phone call it agreed to cover the costs of his hotel accommodation. Mr N says he 
followed the banks instructions, and the rest of his family went back home, which he says 
caused his marriage to break down, relationships with his family to deteriorate and his health 
condition to worsen. 
In response to Mr Ns complaint, NatWest said it should have provided Mr N with better 
service when he asked them about the bankers draft and should have made it clear to him 
that all of his accounts had been blocked when he visited a branch. It apologised and paid 
Mr N £100 compensation for any trouble and upset hed been caused by having to go into 
branch on more than one occasion and its poor communication. NatWest said it hadnt done 
anything wrong when it blocked Mr Ns accounts. And it had done so in line with the account 
terms and its regulatory obligations.  The bank said it hadnt agreed to cover the costs of 
Mr Ns accommodation. Mr N disagreed. He said NatWest should pay him what it said it 
would  the costs of his accommodation, phone calls and compensate him for the trouble 
and upset he was caused, which he said amounted to just over £327. 
On 21 June 2022, NatWest blocked Mr Ns accounts again. The accounts were blocked until 
13 July 2022. Mr N contacted NatWest to try and find out what was happening with his 
accounts and was promised calls backs and a letter. However, NatWest didnt call Mr N back 
within the timeframes it agreed. Mr N complained to NatWest, and it agreed that the service 
it had provided Mr N fell short of what it expected. It apologised and paid Mr N £75 
compensation for any trouble and upset its poor communication had caused Mr N. NatWest 
said it hadnt done anything wrong when it had blocked Mr Ns accounts. 
Unhappy with this, Mr N brought his complaint to our service where an investigator 
considered it. The investigator asked NatWest to provide more information about why it had 
blocked Mr Ns accounts in December 2021 and June 2022.  NatWest gave us some 
information about why it had blocked Mr Ns account in December 2021 but said it couldnt 
provide anything more than it had already provided to us about why it had blocked Mr Ns 
accounts in June 2022. 
The investigator reviewed the information and said that NatWest hadnt done anything wrong 
when it blocked Mr Ns accounts in December 2021. And had done so to comply with its 
legal and regulatory obligations. He agreed that NatWest should have communicated with 
Mr N more clearly. But thought the £100 compensation NatWest had paid Mr N was fair and 
reasonable for the trouble and upset Mr N had been caused. He didnt find any evidence that 
NatWest had told Mr N to stay in the area and that they would cover his costs.
Based on the limited information the bank had provided regarding the second occasion 
NatWest blocked Mr Ns accounts the investigator couldnt say the bank had treated Mr N 
fairly. He thought the £75 compensation offered by NatWest for its poor service was fair and 
reasonable. But he also thought NatWest should pay Mr N  8% interest on the balance of his 
accounts for loss of use of funds whilst his accounts were blocked together with £250 
compensation for the trouble and upset caused by NatWest blocking Mr Ns accounts. 
NatWest disagreed and said it hadnt done anything wrong when it blocked Mr Ns accounts 
in June 2022. Mr N also disagreed. He says NatWest still havent paid him any 
compensation and should pay him the £327 it promised him when it first blocked his 
account. 
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Account blocks
NatWest have important legal and regulatory obligations they must meet when providing 
accounts to customers. They can broadly be summarised as a responsibility to protect 
persons from financial harm, and to prevent and detect financial crime. Its common industry 
practice for firms to restrict access to an account to conduct a review on a customer and/or 
the activity on an account. The terms of the account also permit NatWest to block an 
account. This means NatWest is entitled to block and review an account at any time.
Having looked at all the evidence NatWest has provided I dont believe it was unreasonable 
in the circumstances for NatWest  to block Mr Ns accounts in December 2021. NatWest has 
explained that this was its standard procedure, and I accept that it was. Im satisfied that in 
doing so NatWest were complying with its legal and regulatory obligations. So, whilst I 
accept, the banks actions caused Mr N inconvenience and upset when it decided to block 
his accounts and asked him to provide information, I cant say the bank did anything wrong 
and treated him unfairly in doing so. However, despite being asked by the investigator, NatWest hasnt provided this service with 
much information about its reasons for blocking Mr Ns accounts for a second time in June 
2022. NatWest needs to provide information to this service so we can fairly decide a 
complaint. Ive considered what NatWest has said about why it wont provide further 
information to our service about the reasons it blocked Mr Ns accounts in June 2022. This 
service has the power to request evidence of this nature under the dispute resolution rules 
(DISP) and Im not persuaded the reasons given by NatWest exclude it from complying with 
these rules. So, in this particular case, because of the lack of information I cant be satisfied 
that NatWest has treated Mr N fairly when it blocked his accounts. Taking this into account, I 
agree with the investigator that NatWest should pay Mr N compensation for the trouble and 
upset caused by blocking his accounts.
Ive considered what Mr N has said about how NatWests actions impacted him. Ive no 
doubt this was a worrying and upsetting time for him. But Im satisfied that £250 
compensation along with 8% simple interest on his account balances recommended by the 
investigator recognises the impact NatWests actions had in the overall circumstances of this 
complaint. So, I wont be directing NatWest to pay any more to resolve this aspect of Mr Ns 
complaint.    
I understand Mr N wants NatWest to explain the reason it applied the blocks to his accounts. 
But NatWest doesnt disclose to its customers what triggers a review of their accounts. Its 
under no obligation to tell Mr N the reasons behind the account review and block, as much 
as hed like to know. So, I cant say its done anything wrong by not giving Mr N this 
information when it blocked Mr Ns accounts in December 2021 and June 2022. And it 
wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it do so. 
Service issues
There isnt a set formula that we use to calculate awards for particular mistakes or poor 
service. Its my role to consider what impact NatWests actions have had on Mr N and 
decide, within guidelines set by our service, whether compensation would be appropriate in 
the circumstances. 
Ive considered what Mr N has said about how NatWests actions impacted him. And Ive 
looked at the evidence hes sent in, which includes notes hes made about his contact with 
the bank staff in December 2021 and January 2022. Mr N says NatWest told him to stay in 
the area he was visiting in December 2021, which was a different part of the country to 
where he lived, whilst it completed its review and agreed to cover the costs of his 
accommodation, phone calls and travel. 
Weve asked NatWest about this, and they dont have any evidence that this was agreed. 
Given how long banks generally take to complete account reviews, which is normally 10 
days, and that the review took place over the Christmas holiday season, which could have 
prolonged things I think its unlikely that NatWest suggested it would cover all of Mr Ns 
costs. I note too that from looking at the banks contact notes Mr N told the bank he was 
staying with relatives. So, I find it surprising that the bank would agree to cover the costs of a 
hotel, as Mr N has suggested, when Mr N wasnt actually staying in one. However, even if I 
were to accept what Mr N has said, I wouldnt be directing NatWest to pay Mr N what he 
wants as I dont think NatWest did anything wrong when it blocked Mr Ns accounts in 
December 2021.
Based on the evidence Ive seen I think its fair to say NatWests service fell short during the 
two occasions it blocked Mr Ns accounts. The bank didnt communicate very well with Mr N. 
I say this because Mr N didnt receive the call backs he was promised, and he was passed 
around different departments trying to find out what was happening with his accounts. NatWest also didnt make it clear to Mr N that all his accounts were blocked. So, I can 
appreciate this wouldve been frustrating and upsetting for Mr N.  And I agree some 
compensation is appropriate for this. NatWest has accepted it should have provided Mr N 
with better service. It has apologised and paid Mr N a total of £175 compensation for its poor 
communication - £100 on 14 January 2022 and a further £75 on 14 July 2022.
Im satisfied that the compensation already paid recognises the impact NatWests poor 
service had in the overall circumstances of this complaint. So, I wont be directing NatWest 
to pay any more to resolve this aspect of his complaint. I should also add that having looked 
at Mr Ns account statements I can see that the compensation has already been paid to 
Mr N.  
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained I uphold this complaint and direct National Westminster Bank 
Plc to put things right by doing the following: 
Pay Mr N £250 compensation for the trouble and upset caused by the bank blocking 
his accounts in June 2022
Pay Mr N 8% simple interest on the sum of Mr Ns accounts from 21 June 2022 until 
13 July 2022.
HM Revenue & Customs requires National Westminster Bank Plc to withhold income tax 
from the above-mentioned interest. National Westminster Bank Plc should give Mr N a 
certificate showing how much is taken off if Mr N asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 November 2023.
