Our adjudicator felt Sunny shouldnt have lent Mr J loans  6 -12 and so upheld  Mr Js 
complaint about  these  loans. Sunny didnt agree, so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr J could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN56825822the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Js complaint. In our most recent review of this case  
adjudicator didnt think that loans 1 - 5 or 13 and 14 should be upheld. Mr J seems to have 
accepted this view, so I havent considered these loans further in my decision.  But I have 
thought about these  loans  in the context  of the overall lending  relationship.  
Having reviewed Mr Js overall pattern of lending with Sunny, Ive considered  whether there 
was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful for Mr J. And so, Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Js case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr J was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr J had taken out a running loan facility for four months and then took 
out a further five instalment loans  within two months. And the amounts borrowed 
were not sustainably reducing.  In fact, loan 6 was for the largest amount lent so far. 
So, I think at this point,  Sunny  ought to have  realised it was more  likely than not Mr J 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Js indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN56825823Mr Js first instalment loan was for £100 and loan 6 was for £250. So Sunny ought to 
have known that Mr J was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in their 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
Mr J wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  12 was 
taken out 15 months after Mr Js first. And loan 12 was for a larger  amount than his 
first. Mr J paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr J lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr J borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Js ability to access mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6-12 and Sunny should  put things right. As 
our adjudicator explained, there  is a significant gap between loans 12 and 13 and loans 13 
and 14, so its reasonable at these  particular times  Sunny  thought Mr J wasnt reliant on this 
form of credit and so these loans  are not upheld.
putting things right  what Elevate needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 6 to 12;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 to loan 12 onwards means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So, all entries  about loans 6 - 12 should  be removed 
from Mr Js credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate to take off tax from this interest. Elevate must 
give Mr J a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Js complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should pay Mr J compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 June  2020.
