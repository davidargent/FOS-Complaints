The complaint
Mr J complains about Unum Ltds settlement of his dental insurance claims.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts arent in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our investigator and for these 
reasons:
The policy schedule explains Mr J can make two hygienist claims per policy year up 
to £85 per claim.
 
In the 2020-2021 policy year, Mr J made two hygienist claims to Unum (for £59 and 
£62), which were both settled by Unum.
Although Mr J wanted Unum to later reverse those claims (because he wanted to 
submit two new hygienist claims for the higher amount of £85 each), Unum refused 
to do so. I think that decision was reasonable. 
I say that because Unum settled the claims submitted by Mr J in line with the benefits 
set out under the policy schedule. I therefore dont require it to take any further action 
here. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 April 2022.
