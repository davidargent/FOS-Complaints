The complaint
Mr B complains that Santander UK plc wont refund to him the money that he paid for a 
holiday product. His wife is also involved in his complaint and hes being represented by a 
claims management company.
What happened
Mr B entered into a purchase agreement in October 2005 to buy a holiday product from a 
holiday company. The total sales price was US$22,400 and Mr B says that he paid some of 
that amount using his Santander credit card.
Mr Bs representative, on behalf of Mr B, made claims to Santander in January 2021 under 
section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that the holiday company had 
represented to Mr B that: any unused weeks could be sold back to the holiday company and 
the amount that he recouped would be used to cover the maintenance fees; flights could be 
arranged more cheaply by the holiday company than would be available privately; and the 
product could be sold back to the holiday company at any time  but those representations 
were false. It also said that Mr Bs wife had been diagnosed with a medical issue in 2006  
and the holiday company was advised of it - but her condition worsened, to the extent that 
she required the constant use of a wheelchair from 2019. It said that the holiday company 
was advised but hasnt responded and hasnt made adequate provision to enable Mr B and 
his wife to continue their use of the product. It says that the holiday company committed a 
repudiatory breach of contract which is capable of remedy, but it hasnt remedied the same 
within a reasonable period of time.
Santander said that it was unable to proceed with Mr Bs claim as it was statute barred under 
the Limitation Act 1980. It said that any claim would need to have been brought by 6 years 
from the date of the triggering event, which was the holiday company being made aware of 
Mr Bs wifes medical issues in 2006. Mr B wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint 
was made to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Bs complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
Santander was entitled to rely on the timing of Mr Bs misrepresentation claim to turn it 
down. He said that Mr B hadnt pointed towards any specific term of the contract which had 
been breached so hed not been able to assess whether a breach of contract had occurred 
or whether such a claim had been made within the relevant time limit. He said that he was 
unable to suggest that it was unfair or unreasonable for Santander to turn down Mr Bs claim 
about a breach of contract.
Mr Bs representative, on behalf of Mr B, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has provided further information about the misrepresentations that it says 
were made to Mr B and it says that he didnt realise the extent of the fraudulent claims of the 
holiday company until he attempted to sell the holiday product and he then found a legal 
representative to assist with his complaint. It also says that the purchase agreement was a 
deed so the limitation period would be twelve years from accrual of the cause of action.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr Bs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Bs complaint is that Santander turned down the claims that hed made to it and I 
accept that he referred his complaint to this service within six years of that happening 
- but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to his claims;
Mr Bs claims were made under sections 75 but Im not determining the outcome of 
those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do that - Im considering 
whether or not Santanders response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Bs claim under section 75 is that the holiday product was misrepresented to him 
and that he wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to him and that 
the holiday company has breached the contract - if the criteria for claims under 
section 75 were met, Santander would be expected to consider those claims unless 
the claims were brought outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in 
which case it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the 
claims;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued (which 
is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred)  Im not persuaded that 
the purchase agreement was a deed, but even if it was, I consider that the time limit 
for a misrepresentation claim would be six years from the date on which the cause of 
action accrued; 
I consider that Mr B could have made a claim to the holiday company or Santander 
about the misrepresentations that he says induced him into buying the holiday 
product in October 2005 as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations 
would have been made and any loss would have been incurred as that was when he 
agreed to pay US$22,400 for the holiday product;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Santander  but a misrepresentation claim wasnt made under section 
75 until January 2021, more than fifteen years later which was outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that Santander has a defence to 
Mr Bs misrepresentation claim and I find that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for 
it to have rejected that claim;Mr Bs representative says that Mr B only became aware that he could make a 
misrepresentation claim to Santander after he attempted to sell the holiday product 
and he then found a legal representative to assist with his complaint  but when he 
had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist him for the purposes of the 
Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are 
extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of 
action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr Bs 
claims;
Mr Bs representative has referred to fraudulent claims of the holiday company - 
section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors 
right of action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation 
doesnt begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with 
reasonable diligence have been discovered by them and section 32(2) says that 
deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some 
time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
I dont consider that Mr Bs representative has provided enough evidence to show 
that the holiday company fraudulently misrepresented the holiday product to Mr B 
and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
deliberate concealment of any relevant information - so I dont consider that 
section 32 is applicable in these circumstances; 
the time limit for a breach of contract claim is also six years from the date on which 
the cause of action accrued;
Mr Bs representative says that the holiday company was advised of Mr Bs wife 
medical issue in 2006 but Mr B and his wife were able to continue to use the holiday 
product  it says that her condition worsened, to the extent that she required the 
constant use of a wheelchair from 2019, and the holiday company was contacted but 
hasnt responded and hasnt made adequate provision to enable Mr B and his wife to 
continue their use of the holiday product;
Santander says that the triggering event was Mr Bs wifes diagnosis in 2006  but 
Mr Bs representative says that Mr B and his wife were able to continue to use the 
holiday product after 2006 and I consider it to be more likely than not that any cause 
of action that Mr B might have would have accrued in 2019 when the holiday 
company didnt make adequate provision to enable Mr B and his wife to continue 
their use of the holiday product  and, as that was less than six years before his 
breach of contract claim was made, I dont consider that any breach of contract claim 
would be time-barred;
our investigator said that Mr B hadnt pointed towards any specific term of the 
contract which had been breached so hed not been able to assess whether a breach 
of contract had occurred or whether such a claim had been made within the relevant 
time limit  and he said that he was unable to suggest that it was unfair or 
unreasonable for Santander to turn down Mr Bs breach of contract claim;
Mr Bs representative responded to our investigators recommendation but didnt 
provide any further information about the terms of the contract which Mr B claimed to 
have been breached;
Mr B had entered into the purchase agreement to buy a holiday product that was 
based outside of the UK and the European Union and I can understand his frustration 
and annoyance that the holiday company hasnt responded to the contact that he 
made with it concerning his wifes wheelchair use and hasnt made adequate 
provision to enable Mr B and his wife to continue their use of the product  but Im 
not persuaded that enough evidence has been provided to show that theres been a breach of contract by the holiday company for which Santander would be liable under 
section 75;
Santander responded to the claims that had been made to it and said that it was 
unable to proceed with Mr Bs claim as it was statute barred under the Limitation Act 
 but Mr Bs claims were that there had been misrepresentations and a breach of 
contract and it didnt properly respond to his claim about the misrepresentations and I 
consider that it was wrong for it to say that Mr Bs breach of contract claim was 
statute barred;
I cant say that Santanders response to Mr Bs claims was fair or reasonable  but if 
it had properly responded to his claims I consider that it would have been fair and 
reasonable for it to have said that his misrepresentation claim was time barred and 
that there wasnt enough evidence to show that there had been a breach of contract 
by the holiday company; and
I sympathise with Mr B and his wife for the medical issues that theyre having to deal 
with and for the difficulties that theyve had with the holiday company and the holiday 
product, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me 
to require Santander to refund to Mr B any of the money that he paid for the holiday 
product, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his 
complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2023.
