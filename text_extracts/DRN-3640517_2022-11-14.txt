The complaint
Mrs T complains that a loan she took out with National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) in 
March 2020 was unaffordable. She says the interest rate was too high given that NatWest 
was able to offer her a loan with a much lower interest rate two years later. She feels 
NatWest should have offered her more support with her finances at an earlier stage.
What happened
The details of this complaint as well known to both parties and the key facts are not in 
dispute, so I wont repeat them in full here. The key facts are:
In March 2020 Mrs T took out a consolidation loan with NatWest for £17,600
When the Covid pandemic affected Mrs Ts finances she took a 6-month payment 
holiday on the loan
Mrs T began making the required monthly payments again in November 2020
In January 2022 NatWest spoke with Mrs T and said it could refinance her loan at a 
lower rate of interest
The new loan, for £17,750, was opened in March 2022, at which point Mrs Ts loan 
from March 2020 was repaid
Mrs T says that if NatWest could offer her the lower interest rate in 2022 then the interest 
rate on her earlier loan was clearly too high. She says shed asked for help with her finances 
before but had not been offered assistance until 2022. Mrs T is also unhappy the new loan 
took so long to arrange and is concerned that it is for a higher amount than her original loan.
NatWest looked into what had happened. It agreed that the March 2022 loan had taken 
longer than it should have to arrange, so it refunded the additional interest Mrs T paid on her 
old loan between January 2022  when the reduced rate loan was first discussed with Mrs T 
 and March 2022  when the loan was finalised. NatWest also paid Mrs T £100 
compensation to recognise the impact of the delay on her. But NatWest did not agree that 
Mrs Ts March 2020 loan had been unaffordable when it was agreed, or that it should have 
offered her the reduced interest rate loan earlier than it did.
One of our investigators looked into what had happened and, ultimately, felt that NatWest 
had treated Mrs T fairly. Mrs T disagreed, she feels that NatWest should have done more to 
make her aware of the possibility of a reduced interest rate loan.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive reached the same conclusions as our investigator, and for largely the 
same reasons.
In March 2020 Mrs T applied for a consolidation loan with NatWest. The loan was for 
£17,600 over 84 months at an interest rate of 17.2%. Mrs T has suggested that this loan was 
unaffordable for her given her circumstances at the time, so Ive looked at her financial 
situation and at what NatWest considered when deciding to lend to her. And having done so 
Im satisfied that it was reasonable for NatWest to offer Mrs T this loan. Ill explain why.
Lenders should carry out reasonable and proportionate checks on any lending application. 
The level of those checks will vary depending on the type and amount of the lending. Mrs T 
was taking out a loan for a relatively large amount, but I must bear in mind that most of the 
lending was intended to repay borrowing she already had. 
NatWest says that when considering Mrs Ts loan application it looked at what she had told it 
about her income and expenditure, data about average household spending, and information 
from Mrs Ts credit file. And the information NatWest received indicated that Mrs T was able 
to afford the new loan repayments. NatWest determined that her income  from her salary, 
benefits payments and child maintenance payments  was enough to cover her outgoings 
and this is supported by looking at her current account statements from the time. After 
meeting her essential expenditure and the new loan payments, Mrs T would have some 
money left over each month. 
Mrs T also had no adverse information recorded on her credit file at the time, so there was 
nothing that might have suggested to NatWest that she would have any trouble meeting the 
repayments to the loan. I appreciate that she was using almost the full available overdraft on 
her current account, but Mrs T also held a number of other accounts with NatWest which 
were operating in credit. And the fact that someone is using their overdraft limit does not, in 
itself, mean that they might be struggling with their finances. So with all of this in mind, I 
dont think the overall picture regarding Mrs Ts finances here would have caused NatWest 
any concern. It follows that I find it was reasonable for NatWest to have given Mrs T the loan 
she applied for in March 2020.
Mrs T made one payment to the loan before the Covid pandemic began to affect her 
financial situation. As a result she agreed a six-month payment holiday with NatWest for the 
loan. In November 2020 Mrs T once again began making the normal contractual payments 
to the loan, and she was then able to maintain these payments up until the new loan was 
offered to her in January 2022. So its clear that Mrs T did go on to struggle financially after 
the loan was agreed, but this seems to be as a result of the Covid pandemic specifically 
rather than because the loan given to her in March 2020 was causing her any particular 
financial difficulties.
When the payment holiday ended, and Mrs T began making the contractual monthly 
repayments again, this left an amount of arrears that still needed to be repaid  the six 
months of payments that had been missed. In December 2020 NatWest began writing to 
Mrs T about these arrears, asking her to get in touch to discuss a way forward. This included 
a letter sent to Mrs T on 4 March 2021 which set out that one possible option was a new 
loan at a lower rate of interest. And Mrs T did speak with NatWest, on 17 March 2021, when 
NatWest called her to discuss the loan. At that time Mrs T said she was up to date with all 
her priority payments, but she didnt have time to discuss the loan in any more detail, so 
NatWest confirmed it would send her a text with contact details so she could call back to 
discuss her next steps. 
But Mrs T did not get back in touch with NatWest, and over the next ten months NatWest 
sent Mrs T regular letters and text messages asking her to make contact. Mrs T and 
NatWest finally spoke again in January 2022, when NatWest detailed the offer to refinance 
Mrs Ts existing loan with a lower interest rate loan for £17,750 at 3.9% on a shorter term of 55 months, thereby enabling her to repay the arrears that had accrued during the payment 
holiday without paying extra interest. I acknowledge what Mrs T has said about this new loan 
actually being for a higher amount than her previous loan, but the amount lent needed to 
cover the arrears and interest that had accrued on Mrs Ts existing loan, and overall Mrs T 
would be paying back around £10,000 less over the life of the loan because of the difference 
in interest rates. Ive not seen anything to suggest that any early repayment charges or 
similar were added to Mrs Ts existing loan when the new loan was agreed.
Mrs T agreed to the new loan, but there were then some delays in it being finalised, and 
some confusion in Mrs Ts correspondence with NatWest about exactly what kind of loan 
she was taking out. But NatWest has apologised for that confusion, refunded to Mrs T the 
extra interest she paid on her old loan between January 2022 and March 2022, and also 
paid her a further £100 compensation to recognise any distress and inconvenience caused 
by the confusion and delay. I consider this to be reasonable compensation for what 
happened here.
I appreciate that Mrs T feels NatWest should have offered her the lower interest rate loan at 
a much earlier stage, but it seems that NatWest did suggest this kind of loan might be 
available to her in March 2021. And this loan was an entirely new product, which had not 
been offered before, but which NatWest had created to help those  like Mrs T  who would 
be significantly affected by having to repay the arrears theyd accrued during Covid related 
payment holidays. Essentially, NatWest realised that for those who had taken a payment 
holiday at the start of their loan term, repaying the arrears would mean them paying more 
interest than expected for potentially long periods of time, significantly increasing the cost of 
their borrowing. So, to help, it decided to offer to refinance the loan at a much more 
favourable interest rate than it would usually offer. And with this in mind, and given 
NatWests repeated attempts to make contact with Mrs T over the months after her payment 
holiday ended, I dont think I can reasonably say that NatWest should have either offered 
this loan to Mrs T earlier or done more to make her aware of her options. 
Mrs T has also suggested that because this lower interest rate loan was offered to her in 
2022, that means her 2020 loan interest rate was clearly much too high. I dont agree that is 
the case. When Mrs T applied for her consolidation loan in 2020 NatWest offered her the 
product it was willing to provide based on her level of borrowing, personal circumstances, 
and the wider financial picture at the time. If Mrs T had not been happy with what she was 
offered in 2020 then she would have been free to seek better terms elsewhere.
So, with all of this in mind, Im satisfied that NatWest has treated Mrs T fairly. It follows that I 
wont be asking it to do anything more.
 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 December 2022.
