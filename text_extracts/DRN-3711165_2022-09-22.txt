The complaint
Mrs H, through a representative complains that Morses Club PLC (Morses) didnt carry out
proportionate affordability checks before it granted her loans. She has also said, she
struggled to repay the loan balances and often had multiple loans running at the same time.
What happened
Mrs H was initially thought to have only been advanced two home collected loans between
March and June 2015. Ive included some of the information weve received about these
loans in the table below.

2 £150.00 25/06/2015 sold 34 £7.50
Mrs H had some problems repaying these loans and the outstanding balances to these
loans were sold to a third-party collection agency in April 2016.
The weekly repayment column in the table above is the cost per week per loan. Where
loans overlapped the cost per week was increased, for example when loans 1 and 2 were
running at the same time Mrs Hs weekly commitment to Morses was £20.
Following Mrs Hs complaint Morses wrote to her representative to explain that it wasnt
going to uphold her complaint. Mrs Hs representative didnt accept the outcome and
referred the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
An adjudicator reviewed the complaint. He didnt uphold Mrs Hs complaint about loan 1. But
he thought the combined weekly repayment of loans 1 and 2 represented a too high portion
of Mrs Hs declared weekly income. So, the adjudicator upheld Mrs Hs complaint about
loan 2 as in his view, the repayments were unsustainable.
Morses agreed with the adjudicators assessment and it offered to pay compensation in line
with the adjudicators recommendation. Later Morses explained that no payments had been
made towards this loan. Meaning Mrs H still owed Morses the capital amount she had
borrowed.
This offer was put to Mrs Hs representative who told us it didnt accept it and replied with the
following;
Please could you refer our clients complaint to the ombudsman for final decision as
our client does not Agree with the outcome that has been given.
After the complaint was referred to an ombudsman, further enquiries were made
with Morses, at which point further loans were identified as being lent to Mrs H. I have put
together a new loan table below which includes, as far as we are aware all of Mrs Hs 
lending history with Morses.
There is a gap in lending of almost three years between loans 1 and 2 being sold to a third
party and when Mrs H returned for further borrowing. Ive, therefore considered that there 
were two chains of lending. Loans 1 and 2 and then loans 3  18.

18 £300.00 14/05/2021 outstanding 35 £15.00
Mrs H has had some problems repaying loans 14, 15, 17 and 18 and based on the
statement of account Morses has provided an outstanding balance remains of at least
£1,141.83 as of 26 August 2022.
I then issued my provisional decision explaining the reasons why I was intending to uphold 
Mrs Hs complaint in full. A copy of my provisional findings follows this in italics and smaller 
font and forms part of this final decision.
What I said in my provisional decision
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about this type of lending - including all
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Morses had to assess the lending to check if Mrs H could afford to pay back the amounts
shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was
proportionate to the circumstances. Morses checks couldve taken into account a number of
different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and
Mrs Hs income and expenditure.
With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks
might have been proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Morses should have done
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mrs H. These factors include:Mrs H having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Mrs H having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mrs H coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid
(also suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mrs H.
Morses was required to establish whether Mrs H could sustainably repay the loans  not just
whether she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money
to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Mrs H was able to repay her
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue
difficulties and in particular, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and
without having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further,
then it follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and
thought about what this means for Mrs Hs complaint.
Morses has already accepted that loan 2 shouldnt have been advanced and it has outlined
the compensation that it will pay. As Morses has already accepted something went wrong
with this loan, I no longer think it is in dispute, so Ive not made a full finding about it. But for
completeness I have included it in the putting things right section at the end of this decision.
Instead this decision will focus on whether Morses made reasonable decisions to lend in
relation to loan 1 as well as loans 3 - 18.
Loan 1
For this loan, Morses has shown that it asked Mrs H for details of her income and
expenditure. She declared she had an income of £249 per week with outgoings of £110 per
week. This left Mrs H with £139 a week disposable income in which to make her repayments
of £12.50.
Based solely on her income and expenditure information Morses couldve been confident
Mrs H would be able to comfortably afford the repayments she was committed to making.
Morses also carried out a credit check when the first loan was approved, and a copy of those
results have been supplied to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Having reviewed the
results, I am concerned about the information Morses was provided with and I dont think it
reacted appropriately. A summary of what Ive seen can be found below.
One active County Court Judgement (CCJ) recorded 20 months prior to this loan with a 
balance of £7,828.
She had 10 active credit accounts with outstanding debts of £17,841.
Mrs H had eight defaults recorded on her credit file with the value of the defaulted
balances of £17,508.
The most recent default was recorded eight months before this loan was approved.
Mrs H had over £15,000 of delinquent accounts (so accounts in arrears) and in the
previous month before this loan was approved one account had entered delinquency.
Mrs H already owed other home credit provider(s) over £2,400.
Therefore, given what the credit results show, Im intending to conclude that this loan oughtto not have been provided because the credit results Morses were given indicated that Mrs
H was having longer term financial difficulties and was in my view significantly over indebted
to other creditors and so couldnt afford to take on further lending.
I say this because Mrs H had an outstanding CCJ that she didnt seem to be trying to settle,
had a number of defaults as well as quite a large current outstanding balance which is owed
to her active credit providers. Overall, knowing all of this, I dont think Morses shouldve
approved this loan because it wasnt sustainable for her.
Im therefore proposing to uphold Mrs Hs complaint about this loan.
Loan 3
Mrs H had some significant repayment problems for loans 1 and 2 and Morses sold the
balances to a third-party collection agency in April 2016. This was around three years before
Mrs H returned to Morses for further lending. So, while Morses, could reasonably treat Mrs H
application afresh I do think it needed to consider that a number of years before it had not
collected the full repayments on 2 loans.
For this loan, Morses has shown that it asked Mrs H for details of her income and Mrs H
declared she had an income of £260 per week. Morses also suggested that this income was
checked through a check with the credit reference agency. This wouldve given Morses
confidence that the figure Mrs H declared was accurate.
Mrs H also declared outgoings of £103.50 per week. This left Mrs H with £156.50 a week
disposable income in which to make her repayments of £9. Based solely on her income and
expenditure information Morses couldve been confident Mrs H would be able to comfortably
afford the repayments she was committed to making.
Morses also carried out a credit check when this loan was approved, and a copy of those
results have been supplied to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Ive once again reviewed
the results that Morses received. In my view, Mrs Hs financial position is no better than it
was some three years before, indeed, such as the CCJS her situation had deteriorated. Ive
summarised the results below.
Mrs H now had 3 CCJS recorded on her credit file  for over £8,600 and none of
these CCJS had been settled. The most recent CCJ had been recorded just two
months before the first loan in this chain was approved.
16 active credit accounts with total outstanding debt balances on active accounts of
£11,172.
She already owed over £1,600 to at least one other home credit provider.
Mrs H was above her total credit limit available to her  suggesting she was having
problems maintaining her current credit balances.
Mrs H had approached 11 different companies within the last six months for credit.
10 accounts were marked as being in default and 14 in delinquency. The valve of the
defaulted balances if £9,517 and only one of these defaulted accounts had been
settled.
Therefore, given what the credit results show, I dont think, in this case that it matters
whether the loan appeared pounds and pence affordable. I say this because the credit file
information provided to Morses showed that Mrs H continued to have financial difficulties in
the period of time between loans 2 and 3. She had a new CCJ judgement against her, and
seemed to continue to borrow from at least one other home credit provider. In addition, in
this time, accounts continued to be defaulted and move into delinquency.
Overall, Im satisfied the information within the credit checks ought to have alerted Morses to
the fact that Mrs H was likely having current and immediate financial difficulties and so it
didnt make a fair decision to provide loan 3.
Moving forward, not only loan 3, but I also think all future loans ought to not have beenprovided, because after this loan she continued to take loans from Morses, often for
increasing amounts and at times she had more than one loan running at the same time. To
me, this further reinforced the information Morses saw in the credit file which suggested that
Mrs H wasnt in a position to afford any new borrowing.
Loan 9  18
So, in addition to looking at the checks that Morses did Ive also looked at the overall pattern
of Morses lending history with Mrs H, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which
Morses should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise
harmful. And so Morses should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further
loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Hs case, I think that this point was reached by
loan 9. I say this because:
At this point Morses ought to have realised Mrs H was not managing to repay her
loans sustainably. Mrs H had taken out seven loans in this chain of lending in a little
under a year. So Morses ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs H
was having to borrow further to cover a long-term short fall in her living costs.
From the first loan in this chain onwards, Mrs H was generally provided with a new
loan on the same day a previous loan was repaid and at times had a number of loans
running at the same time. To me, this is a sign that Mrs H was using these loans to
fill a long-term gap in her income rather than as a short-term need.
Over the course of the lending relationship, Mrs Hs weekly commitments generally
increased, there was no time when the decrease was significant or sustained.
Mrs H would normally have more than one loan running concurrently, indeed, by the
end of the lending relationship Mrs H had 5 loans (loans 14  18) running at the
same time, with weekly commitments of £88.10 (capital borrowed of over £2,200),
which was around 25% of her weekly declared income.
Mrs H wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Morses. Loan 18 was
taken out over two years after Mrs Hs first loan in the second chain. Her final loan
was for more than twice the capital amount of Mrs Hs first loan in this chain (loan 3).
Mrs H had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Morses over
an extended period.
I think that Mrs H lost out when Morses provided loans 9 - 18 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Hs indebtedness by allowing
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of
time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mrs H borrowed was likely to
have had negative implications on Mrs Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
Response to the provsional decision
Both Mrs H and Morses were asked to provide any further information they wanted 
considering in response to the provisional decision as soon as possible, but no later than 
21 September 2022. 
Mrs Hs representative responded and explained; we Agree (sic) with this
decision so we will look forward to hearing on the final Ombudsmans decision. 
Morses didnt acknowledge or respond to the provisional decision. 
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has provided anything further for my consideration, I see no reason to 
depart from the findings that I reached in the provisional decision.
I still think Morses shouldnt have provided any of the loans to Mrs H. I say this because the 
credit file data it received showed that Mrs H was likely having financial difficulties at the time 
it advanced loans 1 through to 8. From loan 9, in my view the lending was now harmful and 
unsustainable for Mrs H. 
I am therefore not upholding Mrs Hs complaint in full and Ive outlined below what Morses 
needs to do in order to put things right for her. 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Morses should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it not lent to Mrs H, as Im satisfied it ought to have. Clearly there are a
great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs H may have simply left matters there,
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere. If this wasnt a viable option, she may
have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, she may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if she had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how she would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Mrs H in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Mrs H would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Morsess liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
Morses has already accepted that loan two shouldnt have been provided to Mrs H. But for
completeness and in line with what it has already agreed Ive outlined below what it has
agreed to do.
Morses shouldnt have provided any of the loans to Mrs H.
If Morses has sold the outstanding debt Morses should buy it back if Morses is able to do so
and then take the following steps. If Morses is not able to buy the debt back then Morses
should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
A. Morses should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs H towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not 
including anything Morses have already refunded.
B. Morses should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Mrs H which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs H originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.C. Morses should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mrs H as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mrs H 
having made overpayments then Morses should refund these overpayments with 8% 
simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments 
would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Morses should then refund 
the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D. If there is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus, then the surplus should be paid to Mrs H. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Morses should try to agree an affordable repayment plan 
with Mrs H.
E. Morses should remove any adverse information recorded on Mrs Hs credit file in 
relation to loans 1 - 8. The overall pattern of Mrs Hs borrowing for loans 9  18 
means any information recorded about it is adverse, so Morses should remove these 
loans entirely from Mrs Hs credit file. Morses do not have to remove loans 14, 15, 17 
and 18 from Mrs Hs credit file until these have been repaid, but Morses should still 
remove any adverse information recorded about those loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to deduct tax from this interest. Morses should
give Mrs H a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above and in the provisional decision, Im upholding Mrs Hs 
complaint.
Morses Club PLC should put things right for Mrs H as direct above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 October 2022.
