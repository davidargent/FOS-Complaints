K821x#15complaint
Ms A says CashEuroNet  UK LLC,  trading as QuickQuid, lent to her irresponsibly.
background
I sent both parties my provisional decision  on this complaint on 9 January 2019. A copy of it is 
attached and it forms part of this final decision. The full background  to the complaint  is set out in 
my provisional decision,  so I wont reiterate  it here. 
I explained why I was planning to uphold the complaint in part. And I asked Ms A and QuickQuid 
to let me know if they had anything to add.
Ms A said she agreed with my provisional  decision and didnt have  anything  else she wanted me 
to consider. QuickQuid didnt  agree with my provisional  findings. It said (in summary):
the checks it carried out were adequate and proportionate  to the type and amount of 
credit provided
its approval process is in line with what the FCA and OFT has deemed to be within the 
guidelines for affordable lending
Miss A repaid  more  than the amount contractually  owed each month on her FlexCredit 
account. A customer experiencing  financial difficulty and/or  dependency  would  have the 
need to borrow  more  often, especially when they have  a line of credit available
QuickQuid also provided information about  how it used  credit reference agency validated  figures  
when assessing what Ms A told it about  her existing  credit commitments.
After its initial  response, QuickQuid then offered, as a gesture  of goodwill, to refund  the interest 
Ms A paid on the FlexCredit account,  in line with my provisional decision. It didnt extend this 
offer to any of the loans approved during or after March 2015.
Although Ive only summarised QuickQuids responses,  I confirm Ive read them in their entirety. 
If I havent commented on every point,  its because it wasnt necessary to do so to reach  a fair 
outcome.
my findings
Ive considered again all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good industry 
practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
Having done so, Ive not been persuaded to depart from my provisional  findings. Ill explain why.
Ref: DRN80515862I appreciate QuickQuid considers the checks it carried out were  always proportionate. But 
I think its response to my provisional  decision is somewhat contradictory in this respect.
I note in particular that QuickQuid acknowledged: A customer experiencing financial  difficulty 
and or dependency would  have  the need to borrow more often, especially when they have a line 
of credit with principal available  to [utilise] at their leisure.
I agree that frequent  borrowing, particularly where high-cost credit  is concerned, is an indicator  of 
potential financial difficulty. With this in mind, I think its worth reiterating some of the points I 
made in my provisional  decision.
I said: Its notable that Ms A made a large  number of drawdowns on her account  in total 
QuickQuid approved 82 drawdowns between 29 September 2013 and 21 December 2014. This 
is an average of about  one drawdown every  five days.  No late fees were charged during  this time 
but I think the number of drawdowns Ms A made  and the amounts she borrowed during  some 
months  ought  to have caused QuickQuid some concern.
I also noted that the number and value of drawdowns approved in December  2013 (17 
drawdowns, totalling £1,200) stood out. And I concluded that QuickQuid ought to have  looked  
more closely  at Ms As financial circumstances  at this time, to check  whether  Ms A could make 
the repayments sustainably.
Id add that even after the Flex Credit  account was closed in February  2015, QuickQuid approved 
nine further  advances for Ms A in about eight months. Overall, there  were 92 principal amounts 
advanced between 21 August 2013 and 24 November 2015, which averages  out as a loan or 
drawdown being approved  approximately every nine days.
With this said, its hard to see how QuickQuid can accept that frequent borrowing is a sign of 
financial difficulty, whilst not accepting its likely Ms A was in financial  difficulty. I dont  think her 
borrowing could reasonably be described  as anything  other than frequent. And although she 
repaid what she borrowed, I still consider  it would have been proportionate   given the frequency 
of the borrowing  for QuickQuid to have made enquiries about her financial  circumstances,  to 
ensure the repayments  were sustainable.  I continue  to think  
December 2013 is a reasonable time for this to have  occurred, for the reasons I gave  in my 
provisional decision.
Because QuickQuid  didnt  make any further  enquiries,  despite the signs of Ms As financial  
difficulty, I cant accept that the checks it carried out were adequate  or proportionate. Ive 
considered the additional information it has provided about the credit  checks  it carried out. But I 
dont think this information demonstrates  QuickQuid undertook proportionate checks,  as Ill 
explain. 
Quick Quid has provided what  it calls CRA Validated  (Credit  Reference Agency)  credit 
commitments figures and says these were usually higher than what Ms A declared. It says it 
uses the CRA validated figure, when it is higher than what  was declared, to calculate disposable 
income. 
Its difficult for me to comment extensively on the CRA Validated figures without  seeing  the 
underlying data, or methodology, QuickQuid used to arrive at these figures. In general terms, 
without knowing exactly what  is and isnt included in this figure,  its impossible to comment  on the 
proportionality of this type of check.
Ref: DRN80515863But I dont think these  figures  actually  make a difference  in Ms As case. Thats  because, as Ive 
outlined above, the frequency  of Ms As borrowing was a significant  enough cause for concern 
that I thought QuickQuid ought to have asked Ms A to provide it with some proof  of her income  
and outgoings.  This would  have given  QuickQuid a broader picture  of Ms As financial situation 
than a credit  check alone.
As I explained in my provisional decision I thought:
 
a full review of Ms As finances  would have indicated that her disposable income wasnt 
high enough  to enable her to keep borrowing  while also repaying  the debt sustainably
QuickQuid wouldve seen lower income  and higher expenditure  than Ms A had declared. 
QuickQuid wouldve seen that Ms A was spending significant sums of money  on 
gambling
 
QuickQuid hasnt addressed gambling directly   although I know  it considers the checks  it carried 
out before lending  were  proportionate. But, as Ive explained, I dont think this was the case. And 
had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks,  as Ive suggested, I continue to think  it wouldve 
seen Ms As finances were unstable and that it wasnt appropriate to continue lending  to her.
So for the reasons  given  above and in my provisional  decision, Im upholding Ms As complaint in 
part.
what QuickQuid  needs  to do to put things right
QuickQuid must:
refund the interest and charges Ms A paid on the FlexCredit  account resulting from the 
drawdowns made after 31 December  2013
refund the interest and charges Ms A paid on the loans approved on and after 
29 March 2015 (3-6b)
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when they were paid,  until the date 
of settlement
remove any adverse  information about the above from Ms As credit history
HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Ms A a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold the complaint in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things  right by taking  the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2019.

complaint
Ms A says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to her irresponsibly.
background
QuickQuid approved six loans  for Ms A. Ive set out some of the information Quick Quid provided  in a 
table below. Some of these loans (denoted with both a number and letter) were topped  up. This is 
where additional  amounts  were advanced during the course  of the original loan agreement. The 
second loan was a flexible credit facility (FlexCredit) which allowed  Ms S to make drawdowns up to 
a fixed credit limit  in this case £700  and then make repayments in up to ten monthly  instalments.

An adjudicator considered this complaint and recommended it be upheld in part. He thought 
QuickQuid was wrong to approve loans  3-5, 6a and 6b. He also thought  QuickQuid shouldnt  have 
allowed Ms A to make  drawdowns from the FlexCredit  facility from 27 December  2013.  
Quick Quid  didnt agree  with the adjudicator, so the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive taken into account the law, good industry  practice and any 
relevant regulations at the time.
When QuickQuid first lent to Ms A the regulator was the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and relevant 
guidance included  its guidance on irresponsible lending (ILG). From 1 April 2014 onwards the 
regulator was the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and relevant regulations  and guidance included 
its Consumer Credit  sourcebook (CONC). The ILG and CONC contained similar guidance for lenders 
about responsible lending. Among other things, the regulations said lenders should  carry  out 
affordability checks which are proportionate in the circumstances of the loan. The regulations also 
said repayments  should  be sustainable (i.e. can be repaid from income or savings without further 
borrowing) and that lenders  shouldnt allow a borrower  to enter  into consecutive  credit agreements 
where it would be unsustainable to do so. The same guidance also noted  that payday loans are not 
appropriate for borrowing over long periods  of time as their purpose is to help deal with a temporary 
cash flow problem (ILG 6.25 and CONC 6.7.21-22G).
With this in mind, Ive taken into account whether QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks before  
lending and if I find that it didnt, Ive gone  on to consider  what I think proportionate checks  would 
likely have shown.
Ref: DRN80515865did QuickQuid carry out proportionate checks?
For the entire period  of lending,  QuickQuid recorded Ms As net monthly income  as £1,120.  From  27 
March 2015 onwards  it started  to record information  about  Ms As total monthly living expenses  
which together came to £525. QuickQuid also carried  out various types of credit check, although I 
havent seen any of the information it obtained from these checks. QuickQuid  also asked Ms A about  
her employment and residential status and recorded that she was employed and owned  her own 
home.
The first loan QuickQuid approved was for £200 with a single repayment of £228. In the 
circumstances of this loan,  I dont  think the checks QuickQuid undertook were proportionate.  The 
repayment amount was a reasonably significant amount of Ms As monthly  income (about 20%) and I 
dont think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to assume the repayment could be made sustainably 
without knowing anything about Ms As regular monthly expenditure.  So I think QuickQuid shouldve 
asked Ms A some questions about her regular  monthly expenditure, as it eventually  started  to in 
March 2015.
The maximum repayment on loan 2 was slightly higher  and the FlexCredit was a much longer term 
agreement too, so I think QuickQuid shouldve again obtained some  information about Ms As regular  
expenditure to ensure, as best it could, that the repayments could be made sustainably.
The ILG guidance applicable at the time of loan 2 also stated (at paragraph 2.2) that a responsible 
creditor should monitor  a borrowers repayment record during the course  of an agreement and should 
offer assistance if they appear to be experiencing  difficulty. I have therefore also considered  whether  
there were signs  of Ms A experiencing financial  difficulty during the course  of the FlexCredit 
agreement.
Its notable that Ms A made a large number  of drawdowns on her account  in total QuickQuid 
approved 82 drawdowns between 29 September 2013 and 21 December 2014. This is an average of 
about one drawdown every  five days.  No late fees were charged  during this time but I think  the 
number of drawdowns  Ms A made  and the amounts  she borrowed during some months  ought  to 
have caused QuickQuid some concern.
The number of drawdowns approved in December 2013 particularly stands out. 17 drawdowns 
totalling £1,200 were made. As Ms As credit limit was only £700,  this was only able to happen 
because she made a £550  repayment on 27 December   only to quickly borrow a similar  amount 
again.
Although the FlexCredit  account allowed  Ms A up to ten months  to repay  the drawdowns, this wasnt 
how she was using the account. As Ive described above, there were  times when  she was drawing 
down in a month the equivalent to her declared  net monthly income, and then repaying it within days. 
This pattern continued  for example during February 2014 Ms A borrowed  £800 and repaid the 
whole balance  by 14 March,  only to borrow up to the credit limit again by 7 April 2014.
I think  Ms As apparent need to access so much high-cost credit  so frequently  ought to have 
prompted QuickQuid to carry out further checks during the course  of the agreement  to make sure she 
was actually able to continue  making  the repayments sustainably.  I think it would  be reasonable to 
say the month after the December 2013 period Ive highlighted above is the point at which this should 
have happened  given that Ms A borrowed  a little more  than 100% of her salary at this time. The 
repayments Ms A went on to make were large  enough that I consider it wouldve  been proportionate 
for QuickQuid  to make  comprehensive  enquiries about Ms As finances before approving further 
drawdowns. I consider this shouldve included asking  her about all of her credit commitments (regular 
and short-term)  as well as asking her to provide some evidence of her income and outgoings  to help 
verify this information.
As QuickQuid  didnt do this, I dont think it carried  out proportionate checks or did enough to monitor 
Ms As repayment record.
Ref: DRN80515866There was not a significant  gap between the FlexCredit account closing (after QuickQuid withdrew  the 
product) and loan 3. Nor were there any significant  gaps  between any of the subsequent  loans.  By the 
time the FlexCredit account  closed,  Ms A had been indebted to QuickQuid for about 19 months. I 
consider this to be a long time in the context of high-cost credit and I think  this suggests Ms A may 
have been dependent  on this type of borrowing. I think its arguable  that it would have been 
responsible for QuickQuid to decline  further  loans for a period of time once the FlexCredit account 
had been repaid. Continuing to lend without break in my view increased  the risk of Ms A indebtedness 
becoming increasingly unsuitable. But I wont make a finding on this point,  as I think by this time 
proportionate checks would have identified a different reason it wouldnt be appropriate to lend,  as I 
will explain below.
what would proportionate checks  have shown?
I think  its likely loans 1 and 2 would still have been approved if QuickQuid had carried  out 
proportionate checks. Our adjudicator thought that if QuickQuid had questioned Ms A about her 
regular monthly expenditure, shed  have told it this totalled about  £750.  Having received the Ms As 
bank statements, I think this seems reasonably accurate. Bearing  in mind she had said her income  
was £1,120, this would leave  about £370 in monthly income to put towards  the highest repayments on 
these loans, which was £240. With information like this, I think  QuickQuid could  reasonably have 
decided that loans 1 and 2 were sustainably affordable. So Im not planning  to uphold the complaint 
about the approval of loans 1 and 2.
However, I think this situation  would  have changed if QuickQuid had asked Ms A for proof of her 
income and outgoings after December  2013. I cant be certain  of exactly what QuickQuid would  have 
seen, but Ive used Ms As bank statements as I think they provide an accurate factual  record of her 
income and outgoings at the time  so its reasonable  for me to place some weight on them.
In most  months it seems Ms A was paid around £970  by her employer. And as Ive said above,  her 
bank statements suggest  her regular monthly expenses were around £750.  This includes rent, food 
and payments to regular  creditors. So Ms As monthly disposable  income appears to have been only 
around £220.  This wasnt enough to make the highest contractual repayment on the FlexCredit 
account, or enough  to make  the much larger  repayments  shed actually  been making. So I think  had 
QuickQuid monitored the account and offered assistance when it shouldve,  it would have  seen that 
Ms A couldnt afford to continue to operate the FlexCredit  account in a way which  was sustainable.
In addition to this, I think  proportionate checks wouldve  shown QuickQuid that Ms A had been 
spending a substantial amount on gambling.  To give an example, in December  2013 Ms A spent  
around £1,700 across approximately 100 transactions  with much of the expenditure  following  
withdrawals from the FlexCredit  account.  Bearing in mind Ms As income,  it seems the gambling 
wouldnt leave her with any income from which to sustainably make the repayments. So had 
QuickQuid contacted  Ms A and carried  out proportionate checks based on her use of the FlexCredit 
account, it would likely have  seen her finances were quite unstable and that it wasnt appropriate to 
continue lending.
For these  reasons, Im planning to uphold the complaint about loan 2 in part and find that QuickQuid 
shouldnt have allowed further drawdowns after December 2013.
Not much changed with Ms As finances  throughout the rest of period of lending.  So although I have 
concerns about how fair it was for QuickQuid  to lend to Ms A without break for so long, I think 
proportionate checks wouldve shown QuickQuid that it wasnt appropriate to approve loan 3, or the 
subsequent loans. Ms A continued to spend a large amount of money on gambling, which  together 
with her living expenses meant the repayments on loans  3-6b couldnt be made sustainably.
So I also plan to uphold the complaint about the loans  approved on and after 29 March 2015.
Ref: DRN80515867what QuickQuid needs  to do to put things  right
I plan to tell QuickQuid  to:
refund the interest and charges Ms A paid on the FlexCredit account resulting from the 
drawdowns made after 31 December 2013
refund the interest and charges Ms A paid on the loans approved on and after 
29 March  2015 (3-6b)
add to the above  interest at 8% simple  per year, from when they were paid, until the date of 
settlement
remove any adverse  information about the above from Ms As credit history
HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Ms A a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
