K820x#14complaint
Mrs D complains about the way Bank of Scotland Plc trading as Halifax  dealt  with her 
mortgage account when she was in financial difficulties.  Mrs D wants a response from 
Halifax to the delays it caused and as to why it provided incorrect information to the 
Department of Work  and Pensions (DWP). Mrs D believes that Halifax should pay further  
compensation.
background
Mrs D has a mortgage with Halifax. She told Halifax on 2 September  2016 that she couldnt  
continue to pay it as her work had ended abruptly. Mrs D gave details of her income  and 
expenditure to Halifax and got an MI12 form from DWP. Mrs D says that it took a total of 
eight forms to be sent to Halifax  before they completed the form and returned it to DWP.  
This resulted in a backdated payment on 3 August  2017 from DWP to Halifax.
But Mrs D says that the DWP payment each month is based  on an incorrect  figure for the 
original mortgage.  There is a difference in £30,000  between the Halifax and DWP figures. 
Mrs D hasnt got a satisfactory  explanation as to why that is.
Mrs D says that Halifaxs delays resulted in the DWP failing to pay monies for the time she 
had to claim ESA.
Halifax wrote  to Mrs D on 15 August 2017 accepting that it had made errors including  losing  
and mislaying documents in its internal processes related to the MI12  forms. It said that it 
was backdating  the payment of £889.44 received from the DWP on 3 August 2017 to 
January 2017  as if it had received the individual payments on a four weekly basis. Halifax  
also paid Mrs D compensation of £750.  Halifax said that it had provided  the correct  
mortgage information to DWP  and suggested  that Mrs D contact DWP  in relation to the 
calculation of the mortgage payments. 
Our investigator didnt  recommend that this complaint should be upheld  as she felt that the 
£750 paid as compensation by Halifax was fair. Mrs D disagreed  and asked for a review 
saying that that Halifax  hadnt given DWP correct  information.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Part of this complaint relates to Mrs Ds belief that Halifax has been supplying incorrect  
information about her account to DWP. Mrs D provided a copy of the MI12 form completed 
by Halifax and sent to DWP  dated 8 June  2017  and a later one of 23 June 2017. Both forms 
ask whether the loan was for house purchase or home improvement. Both forms refer to a 
loan of £89,998 taken out for a house  purchase  in September  1999. The loan is interest only 
and is composed of two accounts (the account numbers end in 05 and 06). The balance on 
one of these accounts is £59,240.68 and the other is £33,171.89. There are arrears on both 
accounts. Mrs D says that the balance on the original loan should be about £90,000. It would 
seem that at the time it was slightly over £90,000  to include  the arrears.  I have checked 
these figures with Halifaxs statement on these accounts and the figures supplied to DWP 
agree with these  figures. 
Ref: DRN04603912Mrs D also had another interest only loan (ending 04) which is described on the forms as for 
home improvements. The forms  ask what that the original  amount borrowed is and Halifax  
says £32,000.Halifax  is then asked for the current balance outstanding and the reply is 
£73,894.50 with arrears  of £1,917.86. The later MI12 form adds some additional information 
that there  was in fact £72,000  borrowed namely £40,000 as a capital  loan in May 2004 and 
£32,000 for improvements in 2007.  Again  the figures presented agree with the statements I 
have seen for Mrs Ds accounts in June 2017.
I note that in her letter to us of 6 July 2018 Mrs D says that Halifax  has continually neglected 
to provide concise  correct  information to DWP  but the forms submitted in June 2017 would 
seem to fairly represent the figures  held by Halifax on these accounts. Mrs D clearly believes 
that she should have received more money  from DWP than she did but this doesnt  appear 
to be the fault of Halifax. So, I cant fairly uphold that part of the complaint.
Mrs D had undoubtedly problems earlier  with the way Halifax  processed  the MI12 forms. 
Mrs D was mistakenly told in December 2016 that the form was sent when it hadnt been.  
There was then a delay in obtaining the form. The Halifax notes indicate that the form was 
sent to the appropriate  benefit centre on several occasions but it doesnt appear to have 
received it. That may have been a problem  with Halifax or with the centre. I acknowledge 
that this must have  been a worrying time for Mrs D. I also have to look at how Halifax  dealt 
overall with Mrs D and the fact that it may not be entirely responsible  for the problem with the 
missing forms.  I can see that the arrears  are a cloud  hanging over Mrs D that could be 
relieved by the house being sold and I hope that she is able to get it sold. But I consider  that 
the compensation of £750 paid by Halifax to cover a number of errors  by it is fair for the 
problems caused  by Halifax alone  and I dont require it to do anymore. On that basis I cant  
fairly uphold  this complaint.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 June  2019.
