The complaint
Mr B brings this complaint on behalf of P (a limited company) in his capacity as director. P 
complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) froze its business bank account without 
good reason. 
What happened
Mr B says when trying to access Ps bank account via both his mobile app and online, he 
discovered the bank account had been frozen. Mr B says NatWest bounced cheques and 
direct debits causing huge embarrassment, inconvenience and potential reputational risk to 
his business, whom had never previously had any problems in the many years they had 
been in business. Mr B says he was never informed of NatWests decision to freeze Ps 
bank account. Mr B says NatWest only told him they needed further information from his co-
director after he had complained, which would allow them to unfreeze the bank account. Mr 
B says NatWest shouldnt be able to freeze his business bank account without first informing 
him and they should apologise for this and pay compensation.
NatWest says they wrote to the co-director at the business address they hold on file on five 
separate occasions explaining that if the information they needed for their Business Profile 
Review wasnt made available to them, the bank account of P would be frozen. NatWest 
says as soon as the information was provided, after a few days the bank account was 
reactivated and as a gesture of goodwill they refunded/waived any unpaid item charges.  
Mr B wasnt happy with NatWests response and referred the matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the information available but didnt uphold the complaint. He 
felt NatWest had made several attempts to contact the co-director  their point of contact, 
and they have a duty to maintain and update their records. The investigator felt NatWest had 
acted fairly here and had refunded the unpaid bank charges and it was not for him to tell 
NatWest to change or amend their business processes. 
Mr B wasnt happy with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same outcome as the investigator and I will explain how 
I have come to my decision. 
I can understand that it would have been upsetting for Mr B to learn Ps bank account had 
been frozen and items returned as a result, without his knowledge. When looking at this 
complaint I will consider if NatWest acted unreasonably when they took the action they did, 
when freezing Ps bank account and subsequently returning items unpaid. 
Mr B says NatWest didnt inform him at any time they needed information from his co-
director, or they would be freezing his companys bank account. Mr B feels NatWest should 
have contacted him if they needed further information rather than simply freezing the bank 
account and returning items unpaid causing difficulties for the business. 
I understand the point Mr B makes here, but when coming to a full and impartial decision, I 
have to rely on the information and evidence provided to me by both parties. 
What I have seen is NatWest records show their contact at P is Mr Bs co-director and not 
Mr B. NatWests process is to liaise with the nominated contact point.  While Mr B may not 
agree, I am satisfied NatWest acted reasonably in using that nominated contact when writing 
to the company about any banking matters. The first thing to say is NatWest are expected to 
ask for information from its customers to ensure their records are accurate and up to date as 
part of their obligations to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). I am satisfied this is what 
they were looking to achieve here, and this was a reasonable action for them to take. 
I have seen evidence that letters were sent to Mr Bs co-director regarding the need for 
further information and the consequences of not receiving it, from early August each month 
until early December 2020. In total five letters were sent to the business at the address 
where all banking correspondence is usually sent. 
Mr B has informed us that his co-director had been poorly and was away from the business 
from early November and resumed work in the early new year of 2021. I can understand that 
would have been a difficult time for the business and I am pleased to see that Mr Bs co-
director is now back working. Having said that, there is no evidence to show that Mr B 
informed NatWest of his co-directors illness at any point, so I cant say that NatWest could 
have been reasonably aware of this. Its worth saying, without knowing this, NatWest would 
continue to write to the main contact, given no mail was ever returned to them suggesting 
the recipient wasnt at the address they had on their records. What is important here is even 
if Mr Bs co-director wasnt at the business to receive the letters, say from November 2020, 
from what I have been told he would have been available in August, September and October 
- so I cant say the business wasnt informed of the proposed actions NatWest were going to 
take if they werent contacted. 
While I can see it would have been frustrating and concerning for Mr B to find out payments 
made by P had been returned unpaid by NatWest, given the letters were sent and 
responded to eventually in December, suggests on balance the other letters sent to the 
same address were also received by the business, but for some reason not acted on. I cant 
say that it would be a requirement of NatWest to contact anyone other than the nominated 
contact for the business as these were the details held in their records and the process 
which they work to. While Mr B may not agree, I cant tell NatWest to change their processes 
to meet individual business circumstances and I am satisfied they have taken reasonable 
steps to inform the business of the information they needed and the consequences of not 
receiving it, for the reasons I have already given.   
I understand NatWest have waived and refunded charges relating to any unpaid items as a 
gesture of goodwill and I am satisfied that is a reasonable and fair course of action here. 
It follows, while Mr B will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking anymore of 
NatWest. 
My final decisionMy final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask P to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 September 2021.
