The complaint
Mr L complains that Western Circle Ltd (trading as Cashfloat) lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in June 2020 that I summarise below.
Mr L was given five loans by Cashfloat between April 2016 and April 2017. Each of the 
loans was repayable in either two or three monthly instalments. Mr L has successfully 
repaid all the loans and a summary of his borrowing from Cashfloat is as follows;
Loan 
NumberBorrowing 
DateRepayment 
DateLoan 
Amount 
1 26/04/2016 21/07/2016 £  300
2 25/08/2016 05/09/2016 £  300
3 21/12/2016 31/12/2016 £  300
4 14/02/2017 02/03/2017 £  200
5 02/04/2017 15/05/2017 £  300
In my provisional decision I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, and 
in particular I said that the checks Cashfloat needed to do would need to take into account 
things such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, 
I thought less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
I thought that the checks Cashfloat did before agreeing the first four loans were 
proportionate. So I didn't think it had been wrong for Cashfloat to agree to give these loans 
to Mr L.
I thought that Cashfloat should have done more checks before agreeing the final loan. But 
Mr L hadn't given us enough information for me to determine what better checks would have 
shown to the lender. So I wasn't able to say that Cashfloat had been wrong to agree this 
loan either. I encouraged Mr L to provide us with evidence of his financial position at the time 
of the last loan. I thought that evidence might show that better checks would have led to his 
loan request being declined.
Mr L has used a claims management company (CMC) to help him with his complaint. The 
CMC says that it has sent a copy of the provisional decision to Mr L on at least two 
occasions and asked for his comments or any further evidence. His CMC hasnt sent us 
anything more from Mr L. And weve not had any response to the provisional decision from 
Cashfloat either.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that neither Cashfloat nor Mr L have provided me with any further evidence or 
comments I see no reason to alter the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. It 
follows that I havent seen any evidence to persuade me that Cashfloat shouldnt have given 
the five loans to Mr L. I dont uphold this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, and in my provisional decision I dont uphold the complaint or 
make any award against Western Circle Ltd.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 August 2020.
