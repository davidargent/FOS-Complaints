The complaint
Ms B complains about National Westminster Bank PLC (NatWest) closing her bank 
account. 
What happened
Ms B opened a bank account with NatWest in 2018. The account was blocked by NatWest in 
mid-June 2021. 
NatWest sent a letter to Ms B on 16 June 2021, which gave Ms B 14 days notice that her 
account would be closed. 
Ms B complained to NatWest about her account being blocked; about not being told why it 
had been blocked: not being able to access funds in the account; being told to visit her local 
branch and being incorrectly told she could withdraw money from her branch. She also 
complained that NatWest had told her to apply elsewhere for a bank account, but her 
application had been turned down. Ms B told NatWest that she was unable to wait 60 days 
to get access to the money in her account. 
NatWest responded to Ms Bs complaint soon after and said its decision to close her account 
remained unchanged. It said it was unable to provide Ms B with any specific details about 
how it arrived at its decision. NatWest apologised for Ms B being incorrectly told that she 
could withdraw money from the blocked account.
 
NatWest then closed Ms Bs account in mid-August 2021 and the funds from her account 
were released to her at around the same time. 
Ms B remained unhappy and so brought her complaint to this Service. She was concerned 
that she had tried to open bank accounts with a number of different banks but wasnt able to. 
Our Investigator looked into Ms Bs complaint but didnt uphold it. She said the terms of the 
account allowed it to close Ms Bs account, so she didnt think NatWest treated Ms B 
unfairly. 
Ms B didnt agree with what our Investigator said, so this came to me for a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I want to first of all let Ms B know that some of the concerns she has raised cant be 
addressed in this decision. Ms B complained that several other banks have declined 
applications she made to open accounts with them. But this decision is just about NatWest, 
so I cant comment on the actions of other banks who may have declined her applications. 
Similarly, Ms B also mentioned being the victim of fraud, in relation to a bank account with a 
different bank. I appreciate how stressful this must be for her but, as I said, I can only look at 
the actions undertaken by NatWest here. 
So Ive looked at whether NatWest acted fairly when it closed Ms Bs account, and Im 
satisfied it did. I say this because NatWests terms state it can either close accounts with a 
reasonable period of notice, allowing consumers time to open an account elsewhere, or it 
can close accounts without notice in specific circumstances. In Ms Bs case it gave her 14 
days notice, although I note the account was blocked immediately, which means it was 
effectively closed without notice. But, as I said, its terms allow it to do this in particular 
circumstances. And having seen the information about the account closure provided by 
NatWest, Im satisfied it complied with the account terms when closing the account in the 
way it did. 
I know Ms B is keen to know just why the account was closed. This is understandable, but 
NatWest arent obliged to disclose this, and it wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it to 
do so. Just as a customer can choose who they bank with, a bank can choose who they 
have (and keep) as customers. A bank doesnt need to explain to customers why theyre 
closing an account, just as a customer wouldnt have to provide their bank with a reason if 
they decided to leave them. All I can do is assure Ms B that I have seen all of the information 
provided by NatWest in relation to her complaint and Im satisfied it acted fairly when it 
closed her account. 
I can see that NatWest paid the balance of Ms Bs account to her within a month of her 
completing the release form, which Im satisfied is a reasonable amount of time.
Ms B was also unhappy that she had been incorrectly told she could visit her branch to sort 
this matter out and withdraw some of the money in her account. I can understand the loss of 
expectation that she will have experienced here. However, NatWest has apologised to Ms B 
for this, and I dont think it needs to do any more. 
I know my decision will disappoint Ms B, but I could only ask NatWest to take further action 
here if I thought it had acted unfairly, and Im satisfied thats not the case.
My final decision
Its my final decision that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 November 2023.
