DRN-3616128
The complaint
Ms T complains that when she transferred £1000 from her account with Partners Credit 
Union Limited (PCU), a sum of £2000 was debited from her account.
What happened
Ms T held an account with PCU. In September 2021 she requested a transfer of £1000 to 
her current account. Shes unhappy because the sum of £2000 was debited from her 
account even thought she only transferred and received £1000.
Ms T complained to PCU. It said the balance on Ms Ts account had been displayed 
incorrectly as £4491.28 rather than £3491.28 due to a system error. It said that it had 
checked all transactions since 1998 and that the current balance was correct. PCU 
apologised for the error and paid compensation of £25.
Ms T remained unhappy and complained to this service.
Our investigator upheld the complaint. She didnt think it was fair that Ms T had her balance 
reduced without notice in September 2021 because of an error which had occurred some 
years previously. She said PCU should credit Ms Ts account with £1000.
PCU didnt agree. It said Ms Ts balance had been displayed incorrectly from 2020 onwards 
and that prior to this the balance had been displayed correctly on the online banking 
platform.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at the screenshot of the account dated 9 October 1998. This shows a balance of 
£4491.28.
PCU says that the screenshot shows the balance being transferred from manual records to 
computerised records. It says it isnt able to provide details of Ms Ts balance prior to 1998 
because no computerised records are available. PCU says that when the incuba hub was 
introduced in 2020, the 1998 balance was displayed incorrectly on Ms Ts account, with the 
error only becoming apparent at a later date, at which point it was corrected by debiting 
£1000. PCU hasnt provided incuba statements prior to the correction.
Ive taken all of the available information into account. Ive also considered PCUs 
explanation of how the running balance error occurred. This is based on what the developers 
of the system have told PCU.
Having done so, Im not persuaded by the explanation for the balance discrepancy. Based 
on what Ive seen, Ms Ts balance was reduced by an additional £1000. I havent seen 
enough information from PCU to persuade me that the account balance displayed was 
incorrect due to a system error.
Taking everything into account, I dont think PCU has acted fairly.
Putting things right
To put things right PCU should credit Ms Ts account with £1000.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. Partners Credit Union Limited  must credit 
Ms Ts account with £1000.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms T to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 February 2023.
