The complaint
Miss W complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) has recorded a default on 
her credit file. 
What happened
Miss W originally complained to PayPal about the interest she was charged in respect of 
missed PayPal Credit repayments. PayPal issued a final response in respect of this 
complaint on 12 October 2021 and advised Miss W that when she changed her bank, she 
also needed to update her chosen PayPal Credit repayment details separately. As a gesture 
of goodwill, PayPal reimbursed the interest charges.
In 2022 Miss W found out that PayPal had registered a default on her credit file in respect of 
the missed payments in July 2021. She contacted PayPal and this service. PayPal said the 
complaint was brought out of time so wasnt one this service can consider. An investigator at 
this service said that as the default was registered after the date of the final response, this 
service can consider whether it was fair to record a default on Miss Ws credit file. But she 
didnt uphold Miss Ws complaint. 
The investigator said that PayPal had made Miss W aware that payments were outstanding 
and given her a reasonable opportunity to make payment. The investigator also said PayPal 
followed the correct process when recording the default. PayPal didnt receive a payment to 
the credit account between September 2020 and February 2021 in spite of sending emails to 
the correct address and sending a default notice on 23 July 2021 which advised that it would 
contact credit reference agencies if payment wasnt received by 6 August 2021. 
Miss W didnt accept the investigators findings. She said that a direct debit to pay the 
outstanding balance each month was moved to a different bank as part of a current account 
switch and her new bank said all amounts claimed by PayPal had successfully been taken. 
Miss W also said that payments were made to PayPal in July and August 2021. 
The complaint has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I cant comment on what happened when the current account switch was completed and can 
only consider whether PayPal acted fairly in registering the default.
Its clear from the transaction history provided by PayPal that no payments were made to the 
account between 19 September 2020 and 12 February 2021. The payments Miss W has 
referred to relate to payments she has made for purchases and arent related to PayPal 
Credit. 
PayPals Credit User Agreement says, 
Missed Payments
Missing your minimum payments could have severe consequences, including our 
taking legal action against you, and may make obtaining credit more difficult. If you 
miss payments
C. your credit records may be affected in a way that makes it more difficult or expensive to 
obtain further credit  
So Im satisfied PayPal acted in accordance with its terms in Miss Ws case. 
Ive also considered the communications PayPal had with Miss W to ensure it took 
reasonable steps to make Miss W aware that minimum payments had been missed. Having 
done so, its clear Miss W received multiple emails as follows:

15/07/22 Payment due soonHaving considered the evidence provided to me, Im satisfied PayPal took reasonable steps 
to contact Miss W about the missed payments. I appreciate Miss W has explained that long 
term mental health issues prevented her from keeping a close eye on the situation and that 
she always relied on direct debit payments automatically clearing her balance. I can also see 
that once Miss W became aware that payments hadnt been made, she cleared her balance. 
Whilst I can understand that Miss W may not have read all the communication sent to her 
and am sympathetic to the position she now finds herself in, I cant say PayPal acted unfairly 
in the circumstances of this case. The emails PayPal sent to Miss W made it clear that she 
needed to take action. 
PayPal also sent a default notice to Miss W by post on 23 July 2022 which gave Miss W until 
6 August to pay the arrears she owed. The letter also gave Miss W 28 days notice of 
PayPals intention to register a default if payment wasnt made. No payment was received, 
and the default was reported to credit reference agencies on 23 August 2021. In the 
circumstances, Im satisfied PayPal followed the right process before registering the default. 
My final decision
For the reasons stated, I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 23 October 2023.
