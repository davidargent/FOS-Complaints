Complaint
Mr A is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his account.
Background
In September 2022, NatWest sent Mr A a letter telling him that it was closing his account 
within 14 days. As NatWest placed a block on further transactions and cancelled all Mr As 
direct debits and standing orders, this effectively amounted to a closure with immediate 
effect. Mr A subsequently complained about NatWest actions. NatWest didnt uphold Mr As 
complaint. As Mr A remained dissatisfied, Mr A referred the matter to our service.
One of our adjudicators looked into Mr As concerns. She didnt think that NatWest had done 
anything wrong or treated Mr A unfairly and so didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. 
Mr A disagreed and so the complaint was passed to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered everything, I dont think that NatWest acted unfairly towards    
Mr A and so Im not upholding his complaint. Ill explain why in a little more detail.
As our adjudicator explained to Mr A, a bank is under no obligation to continue offering an 
account to a consumer if it doesnt wish to do so. And NatWest decided it didnt wish to have 
Mr A as a customer. Mr A is unhappy that NatWest didnt give him the opportunity to 
challenge the decision. However, closing a customers account is a commercial decision that 
a bank is entitled to take. And it has no obligation to share its reasons for that decision.
Nonetheless, Mr A has since been told that his account was closed because, amongst other 
things, NatWest saw a fraud marker another financial institution had recorded against him. I 
understand that Mr A has been directed to the appropriate organisation to find out more 
about the marker and the circumstances behind it. 
Furthermore, it is up to an individual bank to decide the circumstances and parameters 
within which it offers consumers an account. And, in this case, Im satisfied that NatWest 
reasonably reacted to the information it saw about the fraud marker recorded against Mr A 
and that it was entitled to take the course of action it did. 
So I dont think that NatWest did anything wrong here. And while Mr A might have gone on 
to experience inconvenience and disappointment, Im satisfied that none of this occurred 
because NatWest acted unfairly or did something it wasnt entitled to do. 
Overall and having considered everything, I dont think that NatWest acted unfairly towards 
Mr A and Im not upholding this complaint. I appreciate this will be very disappointing for    
Mr A. But I hope hell understand the reasons for my decision and that hell appreciate why 
NatWest was entitled to close his account in the way that it did. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 July 2023.
