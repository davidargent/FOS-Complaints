The complaint
Mrs W says Capital One (Europe) plc mis-sold her a payment protection insurance (PPI) 
policy. 
What happened
Mrs W bought the policy in 2002 at the same time as taking out a credit card. 
Our adjudicator didn't uphold the complaint. Mrs W disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Ws case.
Ive decided not to uphold Mrs Ws complaint for the following reasons
From what we know about how Capital One sold PPI at the time, I think Mrs W wouldve 
been aware that she had a choice about buying the PPI, and that she chose to take it. 
Capital One didn't recommend the PPI to Mrs W so it didn't have to check if it was right for 
her. 
Its possible the information Capital One gave Mrs W about the PPI wasn't as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Mrs W doesn't appear to have been affected by any of the main things 
the policy didn't cover  and based on what I know about her circumstances it looks like the 
policy couldve been useful to her. So, I dont think better information wouldve stopped her 
buying it. 
Ive taken into account Mrs Ws comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Ws complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs W to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 March 2020.
