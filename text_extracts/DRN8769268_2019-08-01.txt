Some of Ms Ss loans  overlapped with one another. Where this was the case, the 
repayment column includes the total of any overlapping repayments on loans outstanding 
at that point.
Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Ss complaint  and thought the loans  from 5 onwards shouldnt 
have been given. Ultimately, no agreement could  be reached and the case  has now been 
passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny had to assess Ms Ss applications  for borrowing to check  if she could afford to pay 
back the amounts  shed  borrowed  without  undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way 
which was proportionate to the circumstances. Sunnys checks could have  taken into 
account a number of different things, such as how much  was being lent, the size of the 
repayments and Ms Ss income and expenditure. With this in mind,  I think  in the early  stages 
of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have  been  proportionate.
Ref: DRN87692682But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should have  done  more to establish  that 
any lending  was sustainable for Ms S. These factors include:
Ms S having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts  to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ms S having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long 
period of time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the 
borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms S coming back for loans shortly  after previous borrowing had been repaid,  or 
taking out multiple loans while  existing  balances were still outstanding  (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms S.
Sunny was required to establish whether Ms S could sustainably  repay  her loans   not just 
whether she technically  had enough  money to make  her repayments. Having enough money 
to make her repayments could of course be an indicator  that Ms S was able to repay  her 
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically  mean this is the case. The FCAs Consumer 
Credit Sourcebook  (CONC)  states payments are sustainable if theyre made without undue 
difficulties and in particular, made  on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and 
without having  to borrow to make  them.  If a lender realises, or ought reasonably  to have 
realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, 
then it follows that it should  conclude those  repayments are unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ss complaint.
Like our adjudicator, I think Sunny should  have  carried out more  detailed checks  for loan 4, 
and should have carried out much  more detailed checks before agreeing loan 5 onwards. 
This is because a concerning pattern was emerging in Ms Ss borrowing with Sunny, of her 
taking multiple loans at the same time. In my view this should have prompted a more 
thorough analysis of her financial situation  before agreeing further loans.
I think detailed enough checks would have revealed, at the time of the loan 5 application, 
that Ms S was spending  a high proportion of her income on gambling  transactions  and had 
been doing so for some  time. In some months, Ms S spent more than her income in this 
way, and I think it was apparent that she was taking  loans to fund this kind of activity. Had 
Sunny discovered  this situation, as I think it should have, I dont think  it would have 
considered it was responsible to agree loan 5 for Ms S, as borrowing in order to gamble is 
not a sustainable way of borrowing.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Ms S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen from this pattern 
alone, that further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful.
Ref: DRN87692683Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ss case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because Ms Ss pattern of rapid  re-borrowing and holding multiple loans at the 
same time was firmly established  by this point. This meant Sunny ought to have realised it 
was more likely than not Ms S was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her 
previous loan was leaving  in her finances  and that her indebtedness  was increasing 
unsustainably.
Taking a longer-term view of Ms Ss borrowing from Sunny, its also possible to see that she 
wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed. The same  pattern of borrowing 
continued well beyond  loan 6. Loan 15 was taken  out 12 months after Ms Ss first loan, and 
it was for a larger amount. So Ms S had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect, service a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period.
Ms S lost out because Sunny continued  to provide  borrowing from loan 6 onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ss indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
The large number  of loans was likely to have  had negative  implications on Ms Ss 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
This means  I think  Sunny should  go further to put things right in respect  of loans 6 to 15 than 
it should for loan 5, by entirely removing  the entries for these later loans  from Ms Ss credit  
file.
Putting things  right  what  Sunny needs to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Ms S loans  5 to 15. I direct it to do the following to put things 
right:
A.Add together the total of the repayments made by Ms S towards interest,  fees and 
charges on these loans,  including  payments made  to a third party  where applicable, 
but not including anything  it has already refunded.
B.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Ms S which were 
considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Ms S originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C.Pay Ms S the total of A plus B.
D.Remove any adverse  information it has recorded  on Ms Ss credit file in relation to 
loan 5. The overall pattern of Ms Ss borrowing for loans 6 to 15 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans  
entirely from Ms Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny should 
give Ms S a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
Ref: DRN87692684For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Ss complaint.  
Elevate Credit International Limited must  now take the actions outlined  in the section above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 September 2019.
