K820x#14complaint
Mr M has complained that when  he contacted  National  Westminster  Bank  Plc (NatWest) he 
was given incorrect information about  his available balance.  Mr M says as a result he spent 
and went into an unauthorised overdraft on his account.
Mr M wants his account to be put back in the position it was before  he was given this 
information and to be awarded  compensation.  
Mr M also complained that the service he received as he was passed between  different 
departments when he complained and he felt pressured to accept an offer of compensation 
that NatWest made.  
background
Mr M called NatWest on 6 April 2019. Mr M then continued spending on his account over the 
next few days.  On 8 April 2019 the account was then debited  with transactions, which 
resulted in it becoming overdrawn. As Mr M had no authorised overdraft  facility,  he was 
charged fees for being overdrawn.
Mr M is unhappy  because  he says he spent on his account believing he had a higher 
available balance than he did  resulting in it becoming overdrawn. 
NatWest have said that they debited Mr Ms account  once they received the request and that 
there may have been a delay between  Mr M spending on his account and these requests 
being made by the other businesses. NatWest have also said that Mr M should have 
monitored his account and spending  through his online  banking.  
NatWest initially accepted Mr Ms point that he was told by their adviser  that there were no 
pending transactions on the account and they offered  to take steps  to put things right for 
Mr M. They later did find a copy of the call when Mr M made a subject access request.
They also accepted that Mr M was passed  from department to department  when he 
complained.  
NatWest offered the following  to resolve  Mr Ms complaint:
refund  of £300 charges on the account  ending  452 as a gesture of goodwill;
compensation of £80 to Mr Ms Savings Builder account; 
compensation of £5.40 for the cost of phone calls; and 
they transferred  £582 from account  ending  452 to Mr Ms Savings  Builder  account.   
Mr M was unhappy with NatWests response  and expressed dissatisfaction  at the final 
response letter being sent by post instead of email. NatWest then gave Mr M £10 for call 
costs that Mr M says he was told hed receive. 
NatWest told Mr M theyd  place a hold on the account ending 452 if our service  was going to 
investigate the complaint.  But until then hed continue to receive contact  from NatWest  about 
his account. NatWest also provided  Mr M with a support number for help - related to his 
specific personal circumstances.  
Ref: DRN92456372Mr M then referred his complaint to our service. In summary, our investigator  found that 
NatWest had acted  fairly  and reasonably  and didnt recommend that they needed to do 
anything more than theyd already done. Mr M didnt  accept our investigators  findings as he 
didnt think the actions of NatWest had been adequately assessed in understanding the 
impact of their actions, so the complaint has been referred to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Im sorry  to hear about  Mr Ms personal health circumstances and the impact that he says 
NatWests actions have  had on him. 
During the call to NatWest  on 6 April 2019,  Mr M asked the adviser  about  any pending 
transactions on his account as some  money had been placed in his account overnight. 
The adviser then asked Mr M if he wanted to know about money coming in or going  out. 
Mr M said coming in. The adviser referred  to one credit of £6. Mr M then said its showing  
my available funds  now to be around  about £800. The adviser  then said, the audio  isnt very 
clear at this point - your  available  is eight  and then referred to what  the balance  had 
been for the previous two months. Although Mr M interpreted this as his available balance,  
I cant fairly say that the adviser gave Mr M misleading information as they answered the 
question asked by Mr M accurately. 
Ive seen copies  of some of Mr Ms account statements. They show  that on 8 April 2019 the 
account balance  was £1,090.09. Six credits  were then paid into the account bringing  the 
balance to £1,808.09 and later that day, 23 debits to three different businesses  and three 
transfers to another account left Mr Ms account that totalled £2,166.08, leaving the account 
on minus £357.99.
Normally, retailers  will debit an account within a few working days  after a transaction has 
been authorised  by the customer.  
NatWest have said that if four working days pass and the transaction  hasnt cleared, the 
pending transaction will show as available funds  on an account.  But the retailer can take the 
payment any time within the next six months.  
When Mr M called  NatWest on Saturday 6 April the debits that he had previously authorised 
may not have been showing as pending on his account yet and NatWest have said this 
information wouldnt have  been available to its adviser. Some of these transactions  were  
from Friday 5 April and they didnt debit Mr Ms account until Monday 8 April. 
I dont think that NatWest acted unfairly or unreasonably. There possibly may have been a 
delay of a few days with the third parties  requesting  the money from Mr Ms account, but I 
havent seen that the delay in debiting Mr Ms account was caused  by NatWest. Ive also not 
seen evidence that NatWest adjusted Mr Ms account  statements  as Mr M has alleged.
the steps taken  by NatWest to put things right
In agreement with Mr M, NatWest made a transfer  of £582 to a different account to allow  
Mr M access to that money   when the account was already in an unauthorised overdraft. 
Ref: DRN92456373This was credit  that had gone into Mr Ms account before it was debited  with the transactions  
that left the account overdrawn.  NatWest  were entitled to charge interest,  but to date they 
havent on the overdrawn balance. 
I appreciate that Mr M feels  the amount offered doesnt cover  what this problem has cost 
him, but Im satisfied that the compensation of £80, refund  of £300 fees and the cost of 
calling NatWest is fair and I dont  award any further compensation. 
Ive also not seen any evidence that Mr M was pressured to accept  the offer from NatWest. 
He replied to their final response  letter with additional points and no correspondence Ive 
seen from NatWest to Mr M could reasonably be interpreted as putting pressure on him to 
accept their offer.
other issues raised by Mr M.
Mr M has said that his account was frozen  and debit  card cancelled after this problem arose. 
NatWest put a hold on Mr Ms account  until our service had investigated.  In addition, no 
interest or charges have  been charged  to this account since  the problem  arose either. I think 
the steps taken  by NatWest were in line with what our service would consider to be good 
practice. 
So I think NatWest have  acted fairly  and reasonably in doing  so. 
Mr M should make the appropriate repayment arrangements with NatWest now Ive issued 
my final decision.
NatWest were made aware of Mr Ms personal circumstances during his complaint and Im 
satisfied that theyve taken reasonable steps since that point to offer him support  such  as 
letting him know where he can seek help.  Theres  no evidence that Mr M had made NatWest 
aware prior to the problems with his account. 
NatWest accepted that the service they offered Mr M could have been better and I think  that 
the £80 award  they made is fair. 
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint or award  any further compensation. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 November 2019.
