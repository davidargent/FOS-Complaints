QuickQuid objected to the first five loans being  part of this complaint due to a time issue. Our 
adjudicator addressed that point in his view and QuickQuid  have  said no more  about it from 
which I take it this issue  is settled. All the loans have  been reviewed as part of the complaint.
One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint and he thought that QuickQuid should put 
things right in relation  to Loans  5 to 10.
QuickQuid did not agree. It gave extensive  submissions before and after our adjudicators 
opinion was sent to it, all of which I have read and taken into account.
Mrs M has not disagreed  with the loans which our adjudicator thought  were  alright  and so 
these seem to have been settled  Loans 1 to 4. 
The complaint remained unresolved in relation  to Loans 5 to 10 and was passed to me for a 
decision. I issued  a provisional decision where  I explained that I thought QuickQuid should 
put things right for Mrs M for Loans 5 to 7. A copy of that provisional decision dated 
31 July 2019 is at the end of this decision and forms part of it. 
Ref: DRN48066672Both Mrs M and QuickQuid had until 14 August 2019 to respond with any further  points. Both 
did reply and neither  had anything else to add. So I am ready  to give my final decision. 
my findings
I have reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
I see no reason to alter the conclusions I reached in my provisional  decision and for the 
same reasons given  on 31 July 2019. I uphold Mrs Ms complaint for Loans 5 to 7. 
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs M paid on Loans 5 to 7 inclusive;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement ;
remove any negative payment information about Loans 5 to 7 from Mrs Ms credit 
file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mrs M a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Ms complaint in part and direct that CashEuroNet  UK 
LLC do as I have set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 September  2019.

my provisional  findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide  what  is fair and reasonable  in 
the circumstances of this complaint. I have taken into account the law, any relevant  regulatory  rules 
and good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
Periods of non-lending
QuickQuid has asked  that the gaps in the lending for Mrs M be reviewed. I do not plan to comment  on 
the gap after June 2012 as these loans (Loans  1 to 4) appear not to be in dispute.  
The gap following  the FlexCredit account  (Loan 7) is long enough to break the loan chain and in my 
view it does  make a difference. As I explain later in this decision, the email correspondence shows me 
that QuickQuid  effectively terminated Loan 7 in December  2014. The next loan application  was a year 
after that in December 2015, and ten months after Loan  7 was repaid in February  2015.  
The gap between Loan 8 and 9 also led to a break in the loan chain again  and I say this because 
Loan 8 was for one month and then the gap before  Mrs M applied for Loan 9 was 5.5 months. 
Having made  my decision in relation to the effect  of these gaps in the lending  then I have turned  to 
consider the merits  and come to some provisional  findings. 
The merits
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mrs M could repay  the loans  
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish whether  
Mrs M could sustainably repay her loans   not just whether the loan payments  were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN48066674Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because sustainable  is defined as being without undue difficulties and in particular 
the customer  should  be able to make  repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower 
wont be able to make  their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their 
repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mrs Ms complaint.
Loan 5
Loan 5 was the fifth loan in this chain  and for £300. The total repayment  figure  was £477 and due to 
have been repaid on two dates  about £89 and £389  each. In view of Mrs Ms declared  income of 
£750 then I think that this was a large  proportion  of her monthly  net income  to have to repay. 
In addition to which I have seen from the email correspondence that Mrs M had paid a late fee for 
Loan 4 and had requested  two extensions in relation  to Loan 2. So her history of struggling  to repay  
was already within the records for QuickQuid to know about. 
So the combination of these  two elements leads  me to conclude that it was not the right decision to 
approve Loan  5 or the loans  following it in this loan chain, which includes Loans 6 and 7. 
I am planning  to uphold Loans 5 to 7. 
FlexCredit account  Loan 7 
As this is a different type of advancement of credit and as it was for a long period of time then I have 
taken the time to explain additional points as to why it was not appropriate  for Mrs M to be granted 
this Loan 7. 
Her declared income was £750 and so in my view the limit of £500 was set too high. Having approved 
it for her the way that the account was run was contrary to the agreement and the picture presented to 
Mrs M upon approval. 
QuickQuid describes this advancement of credit as being more like a credit card in that a limit was set 
up to which the customer could drawdown  the maximum available once approved. And then the 
repayments were meant to be within a reasonable time  notionally worked out to be about  ten 
months. So the illustrative example given to Mrs M was that if she had drawn down the full £500 on 
the first day  22 June 2013  then this schedule  below (taken from the credit agreement) would  have 
been her repayment dates and amounts.
Payment Dates Principal Due Accrued Interest  Minimum Monthly  Repayment
12 July 2013 £50.00 £73.62 £123.62
09 August 2013 £50.00 £103.04 £153.04
06 September 2013 £50.00 £91.56 £141.56
04 October 2013 £50.00 £80.08 £130.08
29 November 2013 £50.00 £137.20 £187.20
27 December 2013 £50.00 £53.04 £103.04
24 January 2014 £50.00 £48.90  £98.90
21 February 2014 £50.00 £34.16 £84.16
21 March  2014 £50.00 £22.68  £72.68
17 April 2014 £50.00 £10.80 £60.80
Ref: DRN48066675The reality was that Mrs M took £200 on the 22 June 2013  and reading  the emails between  
QuickQuid and Mrs M, its clear that QuickQuid demanded full payment each month. This appears to 
have prompted Mrs M to ask for additional  funds, duly given by QuickQuid and increasing the demand 
payments due within a short time.  So the situation for Mrs M became  worse  with each new drawdown. 
I can illustrate this using  the facts from the information provided by QuickQuid:
On 22 June 2013 Mrs M received £200  as requested and early July 2013 she received more than one 
email reminding her of the full amount due to be repaid on 12 July 2013. Before  that repayment date 
arrived Mrs M had asked  for additional funds resulting in an email of 2 August 2013 that over £547 
was due on 9 August  2013.  
As Mrs M had declared an income of £750 then I can imagine that this was a hard bill to face and 
I think  that QuickQuid  ought to have been aware of the impact  that would have had. 
And this illustration of the facts shows that within about six weeks of Mrs M taking  her first £200 on 
the FlexCredit  account she was faced with a bill of just over £547 on 9 August 2013. And yet if Mrs M 
had drawn  down the full £500 on 22 June 2013, on 9 August 2013 she would have had to repay just 
over £153 in accordance with the agreement.
So I think that the method in which this FlexCredit  account was operated from the beginning was not 
as presented to Mrs M and resulted in her having to draw down more  in order to repay. 
It was not until April 2014  that the emails started to refer to the instalment repayments due and then in 
July 2014 a notice of alteration to the terms and conditions was emailed to Mrs M after which more 
references were made to 11 month repayments and more modest sums are demanded of Mrs M. 
In December 2014, as I have seen on other complaint cases relating to FlexCredit accounts,  Mrs M 
was emailed a notice  to end the account at the end of December 2014.  The period from the end of 
December 2014 to end February 2015 was when  Mrs M made a series of repayments to clear  the 
account. 
All in all I think that this account  had a high limit considering Mrs M had declared  an income of £750.  
And I do not think that it was treated by QuickQuid as a FlexCredit account at all, more  like a series of 
payday loans and completely at odds with the terms and conditions of the original agreement. My 
view is that it exacerbated Mrs Ms financial debt position and as I have already said in my provisional 
findings, I am planning to uphold the FlexCredit  account in its entirety. 
Loans 8 to 10 
As I have explained earlier, I think that there were three loan chains: one being  Loans 1 to 7, a 
second being  Loan 8 and a third which included Loans 9 and 10. As such  I think  that it would  have 
been reasonable for QuickQuid to have approached  Loan  8 and Loan 9 with the assumption that 
Mrs Ms finances may have  recovered due to the break in lending.
Mrs M declared her income as £1,002 and her expenditure as £325 for Loan 8 and for Loans 9 and 
10. I have considered the proportionate  checks I would  have expected QuickQuid to have carried  out 
for each of these loans,  and my provisional findings are that I think that these were done.  And having 
done them then I think that QuickQuid  would have thought each of these loans was affordable.
I am not planning  to uphold Loans 8 to 10.
