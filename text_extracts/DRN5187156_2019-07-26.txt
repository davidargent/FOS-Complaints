K820x#14complaint
Its been agreed in this case  that Financial Insurance Company Limited (FICL),  as the 
insurer should accept  responsibility for the complaint. To keep things simple Ill refer to FICL 
as the seller in my decision.
Mrs H says FICL mis-sold  her a payment protection insurance (PPI)  policy.
background
This complaint is about a PPI policy  taken  out alongside a store  card in November 1996.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mrs H disagreed with the adjudicators opinion
so the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mrs Hs case.
Ive decided the policy wasnt mis-sold and Ill explain why.
FICL had to make Mrs H aware the PPI was optional and gain her consent before adding  the 
policy to her card. Mrs H says the policy was added to her card without her knowledge and 
consent. I cant know for certain what was said at the time Mrs H applied  for her card and 
PPI but FICL has sent us a copy  of the available paperwork. Mrs Hs application form had a 
separate section  for PPI where the option  to take the policy has been  selected. Mrs H has 
also signed the form in agreement with the selections made  on it. With this in mind I think 
FICL made it clear  that the PPI was optional and that Mrs H chose to have it.
FICL didnt  recommend the PPI to Mrs H so it didnt have to check if it was right for her. But 
it did have to make sure Mrs H got the information she needed to decide  if it was right for 
her.
Its possible the information FICL gave Mrs H about the PPI wasnt as clear as it shouldve 
been. But she chose  to take out the PPI knowing the other means  she had of making her 
repayments which included sick pay. But the PPI would have paid out in addition  to Mrs Hs 
sick pay and for longer.
Based on what Ive seen  of Mrs Hs circumstances  at the time it doesnt look like she was 
affected by any of the exclusions  to or limits  on the PPI cover   so it would have been useful 
for her if something went wrong. It also looks like the PPI was affordable.  So I dont think 
better information about the PPI would  have put her off taking  out the cover.
Which means FICL doesnt have to pay back the cost of the PPI to Mrs H.
