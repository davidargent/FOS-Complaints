The complaint
Mr J complains about the interest that he's been charged by Hyundai Capital UK Limited, 
trading as Kia Finance, under a conditional sale agreement and about the way that it's dealt 
with a dealer's contribution.  
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr J signed the conditional sale agreement with Kia Finance in April 2016 and 
immediately above his signature it says: "This agreement is a conditional sale 
agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to be 
legally bound by its terms";
the agreement said that the "Rate of interest on the amount of credit" was "2.52% per 
annum, fixed for the duration of this agreement"  and the APR was 4.9%;
the APR is the annual percentage rate of interest and is a measure, for comparison 
purposes, of the overall cost of a loan or other credit facility, including interest and 
fees - and it's a requirement that the APR is included in a credit agreement;
the agreement showed that the cash price of the car was £38,853, Mr J had made an 
advance payment of £18,050 (which he says was £16,800 from him and a 
dealer's contribution of £1,250), the amount of credit was £20,803, the total amount 
of interest was £2,738.55 and the total amount payable was £41,591.55;
Kia Finance had provided credit of £20,803 to Mr J and he'd agreed to pay interest of 
£2,738.55 (which totals £23,541.55) and he'd agreed to make 36 monthly payments 
of £203.55 and a final payment of £16,213.75 (which also totals £23,541.55);
whilst I can understand Mr J's confusion about the rate of interest that he's been 
charged and the way that the dealer's contribution has been dealt with, I'm satisfied 
that the details contained in the agreement are correct and that Kia Finance has 
charged Mr J - and he's paid - the amounts that were set out in the agreement;
I consider that it's reasonable to expect Mr J to have read, and ensured that he 
understood, the agreement before he signed it - and, if he didn't understand it or it 
didn't reflect the deal that he'd agreed with the dealer, for him to have raised any 
issues at that time and not to have signed the agreement;
I'm not persuaded that there's enough evidence to show that the rate of interest has 
been applied incorrectly or that the dealer's contribution hasn't been dealt with 
correctly; andI find that it wouldn't be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Kia Finance to refund any interest to Mr J, to pay him any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to his complaint.
 
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I don't uphold Mr J's complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 June 2020.
