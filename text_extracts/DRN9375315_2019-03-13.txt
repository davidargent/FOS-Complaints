K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains that NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibly when it approved a credit card in 2015. 
Mr S also complains that he didnt know a default  had been  applied in 2016.   
background
Mr S applied for a NewDay  credit  card in 2015  and it was approved.  In August 2016 Mr S 
made his final payment  to the credit  card. NewDay wrote  to him over the following months 
and went on to apply  a default to the credit  card account. 
Mr S complained and NewDay responded in October 2018. NewDay said it had considered 
Mr S credit file as well as other information  when looking  at his application. NewDay  said the 
application was approved  in line with its lending criteria and didnt  uphold  the complaint. In 
addition, NewDay said it sent a default notice  to Mr S in November 2016. 
Mr S referred his complaint to this service and an investigator looked at it. The investigator 
thought NewDay  had lent responsibly when  it approved Mr S credit card and that they were 
satisfied itd written to him about  the default  so didnt  uphold his complaint.  Mr S asked to 
appeal so his complaints been  passed  to me to make a decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There isnt a specific set of checks that lenders  have  to complete before approving an 
application for credit. sIn this case, NewDay says it looked at Mr S credit  file in addition  to 
what he said in the application before deciding to proceed. 
In his application Mr S told NewDay he was employed, earned  around £45,000 a year and 
was living  with his parents.  Mr S has provided  a copy of his credit file which  shows that he 
defaulted some accounts in 2011 and 2013 and had received a County Court  Judgement  in 
2010. 
NewDay has advised that because of the time between the defaults and County Court 
Judgement and Mr S application it still met its lending criteria. NewDay will accept 
applications from customers  with some adverse credit and Mr S application was approved in 
line with its lending criteria. Im sorry to disappoint  Mr S but I dont think the adverse 
information on his credit file was a barrier to his application to NewDay  or shouldve led to an 
automatic decline.  
Ive carefully thought  about everything Mr S and NewDay have said and provided. Having 
done so, Im satisfied that Mr S application  was approved in line with NewDays lending  
criteria. I think the decision to proceed was reasonable  based on what  Mr S said in his 
application as well as what NewDay  found out when it completed a credit  search.  
Mr S says he wasnt aware his account  had been  defaulted in 2016 but Ive seen the letters  
NewDay sent him around that time. NewDays letter dated 28 November 2016  asked Mr S to 
pay £92.98 before 10 December 2016 otherwise his account would be closed and a default 
reported. As Mr S didnt  make any further  payments  or contact NewDay  Im satisfied its 
decision to proceed  with the default was fair. 
Ref: DRN93753152Im sorry  to disappoint Mr S but, for the reasons given above,  I havent found NewDay lent 
irresponsibly when it approved his credit card in 2015. And Im satisfied NewDay  wrote to 
Mr S about  its decision to default  his account  before taking that step. As I havent found any 
evidence of a mistake by NewDay  Im not telling it to do anything else to resolve this 
complaint. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.  Under the rules of the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or reject  my decision 
before 13 April 2019.
