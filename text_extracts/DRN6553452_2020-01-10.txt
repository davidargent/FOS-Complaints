Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Js complaint and thought  the loans from loan 5 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. CashFloat disagreed. It said Mr J was only borrowing the 
minimum amount it offered for all but the last loan.  But even then,  it carried  out robust  
affordability assessments. These assessments showed that although Mr J had other 
financial commitments, the amount he had to contractually repay was low. CashFloat also 
said that Mr J often  repaid  his loans early and had an excellent payment record. 
As CashFloat asked  for an ombudsmans decisions,  the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
CashFloat needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr J 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could consider a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that CashFloat should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN65534522the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that CashFloat was required to establish 
whether Mr J could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  defines  sustainable as 
being without  undue  difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on 
time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to 
meet the repayments. And it follows  that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Js complaint. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Js complaint  about loans 1 to 4. Mr J didnt respond to the 
adjudicators opinion. As there is no dispute  with the adjudicators  findings  about these 
loans, I wont be making  any further findings on these  loans.  
Ive looked at the overall pattern of CashFloats lending history  with Mr J, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which CashFloat should reasonably  have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so CashFloat should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the circumstances of Mr Js case, I think that this point was reached by loan 5 I say 
this because - although  CashFloat did do several checks on Mr J - at this point it ought  to 
have realised Mr J was not managing to repay his loans sustainably.  Mr J had been  indebted  
to CashFloat for over 8 months. And even though Mr J was only borrowing the minimum 
amount, CashFloat ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Mr J was having to 
borrow further to cover  the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances  and 
that Mr Js indebtedness  was increasing  unsustainably.
In addition, Mr J wasnt making  any real inroads to the amount he owed CashFloat. Loan 9 
was taken out 12 months after Mr Js first loan. And it was for double  the amount.  Mr J had 
paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to CashFloat over an extended 
period.
Ref: DRN65534523I think that Mr J lost out because CashFloat continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr J borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Js ability to access mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans. 
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 9 and CashFloat should  put things right.
putting things right  what CashFloat  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 5 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from 5 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  loans  5 to 9 should  be removed from Mr Js 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires CashFloat to take off tax from this interest.  CashFloat must  give 
Mr J a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Js complaint. Western Circle Ltd 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 February  2020.
