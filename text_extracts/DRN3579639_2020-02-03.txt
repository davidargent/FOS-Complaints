Miss B complains  that loans she had from Stagemount Limited  (trading as Quidmarket)  were  
unaffordable.

Rollover 125 Sep 2013 £240 1m £318.00 25 Oct 2013 £180 paid
Miss B says Quidmarket didnt do enough  checks before approving the loans. She says she 
couldnt repay them due to the high interest rate and this negatively impacted her mental  
health and her credit file. She says she was using one short-term loan to repay  another.
Quidmarket says it asked  Miss B about  her circumstances,  her income and expenditure and 
it says it checked her credit file. It says the loans were approved based on the information 
provided. However, Quidmarket offered to uphold the final rollover of loan 1, and waive  the 
interest on loan 3.
Miss B did not accept  this offer.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She said it wasnt good 
practice for Quidmarket to have allowed multiple rollovers of loan 1 and that because shed 
shown signs that she was struggling  to repay  loan 1 it shouldnt have approved  loans 2 or 3. 
She recommended interest and charges (plus 8% statutory  interest) should be refunded  on 
loans 2 and 3, plus the 4th and 5th rollovers  of loan 1. Our adjudicator  also recommended  
that Quidmarket should  remove adverse information about loans 2 and 3 from Miss Bs 
credit file.
Quidmarket responded  to say, in summary, that although it accepted  the findings on loans 2 
and 3, it did not agree that there was regulation in place at the time that limited  the number 
of rollovers.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Quidmarket was required to lend responsibly. It should have made checks to make sure 
Miss B could afford  to repay the loans before it lent to her. Those  checks  needed to be 
proportionate to things such as the amount Miss B was borrowing,  and her lending history. 
But there was no set list of checks Quidmarket had to do.
Ref: DRN35796392Loan 1
Im satisfied Quidmarket did proportionate  checks before approving  loan 1 and I cant see 
there was anything in the available information  that should have indicated  the loan was 
unaffordable to Miss B. But I dont think Quidmarket should have allowed Miss B to rollover 
the repayment of the loan more than three  times. I say that because:
Quidmarket has confirmed it is, and was, a member of the Consumer Finance 
Association (CFA);
On 25 July 2012 the CFA published its own Lending Code for Small Cash  
Advances, which limited the number of rollovers to three. Members of the CFA were 
given until 26 November 2012 to bring their practices into line with the code;
oParagraph 4.6.4 of the code said Members  shall not allow customers to 
extend a short term loan on more than three occasions;
More generally, by the time Miss B had rolled over loan 1 three  times,  shed  paid 
almost as much in interest as the initial loan. I consider this should  have indicated to 
Quidmarket that she may be struggling to manage  her money  given the link between 
rollovers and financial difficulties.
So I find it was irresponsible for Quidmarket to allow the fourth  and fifth rollovers  on loan 1.
Loans 2 and 3
 As Quidmarket has agreed  with our adjudicator on loans 2 and 3 I wont  consider them 
further here.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Stagemount Limited (trading as Quidmarket) 
should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Miss B paid on loans 2 and 3 and rollovers 4 and 
5 of loan 1;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  for loan 3, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Miss B; 
Remove any negative  information about loans 2 and 3 from Miss Bs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Quidmarket  to take off tax from this interest. Quidmarket  
must give Miss B a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one. If 
Quidmarket intends  to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance,  it must do 
so after deducting  the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 March  2020.
