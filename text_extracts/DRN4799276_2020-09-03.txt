K820x#14complaint
Mrs F says Western Circle  Ltd trading as Cashfloat lent to her irresponsibly. She says 
Cashfloat didnt  do adequate checks.  If it had done  better checks it wouldve seen that she 
had significant  financial problems and not lent to her.

Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mrs F disagreed with the adjudicators opinion 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Cashfloat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs F 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
why I think Cashfloats checks were  proportionate
For loan 1 Mrs F needed to repay around £150 a month for the next two months. As in the 
table above, the terms for the remaining two loans didnt vary greatly. 
Ive seen a record  of the information Mrs F provided when she completed her loan 
applications. Mrs F said she had a monthly income of £1,800 and she had regular monthly 
outgoings of around £1,350. This left her with a disposable income of around  £350. So it 
wouldve been reasonable for Cashfloat to have thought that the loans were affordable.  
I havent seen  any further information  that shows its likely Cashfloat was made  aware of any 
financial problems Mrs F mightve been  having.  Or anything that wouldve prompted it to 
investigate her circumstances  further.  
Mrs F has said that she was using other short term lenders. And she had other problems 
managing her money. But Ive seen the credit reference agency results, and other 
Ref: DRN47992762information, that Cashfloat  obtained and these problems arent  apparent in this. Mrs F has 
said why this was for some of the information.  Thinking about everything Ive seen I think  it 
was reasonable  for Cashfloat to rely on the information it obtained.
So overall, in these circumstances, I think the assessments  Cashfloat did for these loans  
were proportionate. So I think Cashfloats decisions to lend were reasonable and Im not 
upholding Mrs Fs complaint about  them.  
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mrs Fs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 October  2020.
