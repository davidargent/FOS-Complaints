K820x#14complaint
Mr H and Mrs R complain they received  poor service when they tried to extend their 
mortgage with National Westminster Bank  Plc. And theyre unhappy it wouldnt let them  
extend the mortgage for as long as they wanted at the rate they wanted.
background
Mr H and Mrs R took out an interest only mortgage  of Â£500,000 with National  Westminster 
Bank Plc (NatWest) in 2007. The mortgage had a term of eight  years  and was due to end 
in September  2015. In around  March 2016  NatWest  agreed to extend  the term until July 
2018.
Mr H and Mrs R asked NatWest in January 2018 to extend the mortgage  further.  Because of 
delays by NatWest  it didnt give them a decision until after the existing mortgage term and 
fixed interest rate product  had ended.  
Mr H and Mrs R wanted a two year extension on the same interest rate theyd had 
previously. NatWest would only agree to extend  the term for a further 12 months on the 
standard variable  rate. This meant their monthly mortgage payments were more  than double 
what theyd been  paying earlier on. Mr H and Mrs R said if NatWest had given them a 
decision sooner  they wouldve re-mortgaged with another lender at a better rate.
Mr H and Mrs R were unhappy  that NatWest only compensated them  for poor service  it 
agreed it had provided. So they brought their complaint  to this service.  Our investigator felt 
NatWest had behaved reasonably in the circumstances of Mr H and Mrs Rs complaint. The 
matters been  referred  to me to review as Mr H and Mrs R dont agree with our investigators 
opinion.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H and Mrs R took out their mortgage with NatWest in 2007.  The original term ended in 
September 2015. Mr H and Mrs R werent  able to repay their borrowing at that time. 
In October  2015, after the original term had expired, Mr H and Mrs R asked  NatWest  to 
extend their mortgage.  NatWest agreed  an extension until July 2018  on the understanding 
Mr H and Mrs Rs strategy  to repay  the mortgage at the end of the extended term was to sell 
a number of buy to let investment properties owned  by Mr H. Although NatWests lending  
guidelines were  generally not to lend beyond age 70, this took Mr H to around  72 years  old.
During the extended period of the mortgage  Mr H and Mrs R benefited from a two year 
tracker interest rate product until 31 March 2018.  The interest rate reverted to NatWests  
standard variable  rate from 1 April 2018,  which more than doubled their monthly  payments.
Mr H and Mrs R say they werent told the interest rate would revert  to the standard variable 
rate until after the tracker  product had ended.  But Im satisfied Mr H and Mrs R wouldve 
understood the terms theyd agreed to in extending  the mortgage, including the interest rates 
that applied and for what periods. They were  clearly set out in the documentation  recording 
the changes NatWest sent them  in March 2016 which  I think Mr and Mrs H agreed to. 
Ref: DRN23770672Mr H contacted NatWest in early January 2018  to discuss the mortgage.  NatWest reminded 
Mr H then the term would end in July 2018, the tracker product would end in March  2018 
and Mr H and Mrs R would have to pay the standard variable rate from 1 April 2018 
onwards. 
Unfortunately a meeting arranged with a NatWest mortgage adviser to discuss  things further 
later in January  2018 didnt take place. Mr H found  it very difficult to get hold of anyone  at 
NatWest to speak to. And it wasnt until early April 2018, after the tracker rate had ended,  
that Mr H managed to speak to someone. Mr H was told then he and Mrs R wouldnt be able 
to have the favourable tracker rate theyd had before.  Mr H was understandably  upset he 
hadnt been able to discuss  things  sooner.  Mr H and Mrs J were  also unhappy theyd had to 
provide again  information  theyd already given NatWest. 
When Mr H contacted NatWest in January 2018, he and Mrs R were looking to extend the 
term further for two years. Mr H was already 72 at the time and the extension  they wanted  
wouldve taken him to around  the age of 75. But NatWest was only prepared  to give them  a 
years extension. And fixed rates werent  available for periods of less than two years.
NatWests lending guidelines said it could consider lending  up to a maximum age of 70 
subject to a full underwriting assessment. Its reasonable for a lender not to want  to lend too 
far into retirement. I need to consider whether NatWest  applied its policy fairly here.
I think NatWest  had treated Mr H and Mrs R fairly in extending the original term in 2016.  This 
extension already took Mr H beyond age 70 and outside NatWests lending  guidelines.  
Mr H and Mrs R werent  able to pay off the mortgage at the end of the extended term. But 
thats because  I understand Mr H may have reinvested some proceeds  from the sale of 
some of his investment properties elsewhere  and that he only served notice on other tenants 
in around July 2018. So I can understand NatWest may have had some concerns about 
Mr Hs plans to pay back the borrowing and why it might have been reluctant  to give him 
much more time to pay off the mortgage even if Mr H had fallen  within the lending 
guidelines. Mr H and Mrs R had known  since 2016  that theyd have to pay off the mortgage 
in 2018  but still chose  not to use the proceeds of sales of their investment properties to do 
that.
In 2018 NatWest did agree to extend the mortgage by a further year.  That would give 
Mr H and Mrs R a further year to raise the funds to repay it  whether through sale of other  
properties or a remortgage.  The mortgage does have to be repaid, and theyd had two years 
to find a solution already, so I think a further  extension of one year is fair. That means that 
NatWest wasnt prepared  to offer a fixed interest rate for that period of time. For commercial 
reasons lenders dont usually offer fixed interest  rate products for less than two years.
 Mr H and Mrs R werent  entitled to a fixed rate under their mortgage  agreement  as in 
every case,  they can apply for a new rate (subject  to eligibility)  when an old one expires, but 
its not a right. And theres no obligation on NatWest to offer any particular interest rate 
products, provided  it treats its customers fairly in deciding whether to offer those rates to 
them. For the reasons  Ive explained,  I think it was fair for NatWest not to offer Mr H and Mrs 
R the two year extension  and fixed interest rate product they asked for.
Mr H and Mrs R say if theyd known sooner NatWest  wouldnt give them the extension and 
interest rate they wanted, theyd have approached other lenders. But as Ive said, they knew 
from 2016 that the rate would expire in April,  and the mortgage  in July, of 2018. So theyd 
Ref: DRN23770673already had two years  to do that. I dont think theres  any evidence the poor service 
NatWests acknowledged  it provided led Mr H and Mrs R to incur any financial losses.
Considering everything, I think it was fair and reasonable for NatWest  to offer
Mr H and Mrs R a years  extension  on the standard variable rate which gave them  time to 
raise funds to pay off the mortgage. And I think the compensation  NatWest  paid Mr H and 
Mrs R for the poor service theyd had was fair. 
Bearing everything in mind, I dont uphold Mr H and Mrs Rs complaint.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold Mr H and Mrs Rs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H and Mrs R to 
accept or reject my decision  before  4 April 2019.
