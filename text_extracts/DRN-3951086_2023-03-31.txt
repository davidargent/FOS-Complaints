The complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly closed his bank 
account without providing a reason.
 
What happened
Mr B held an account with NatWest. In September 2022 NatWest wrote to him to explain that 
after a review of the products and services they offer, they had reached the decision that 
they would no longer be able to provide Mr B with banking facilities. 
They explained that they were giving Mr B 60 days notice from the date of their letter to 
make alternative banking arrangements, after which, his account would be closed. They also 
explained that if Mr B had any outstanding borrowing facilities with them, that he would need 
to make arrangements to repay the full amount in the next 30 days as the facility would be 
removed. Unhappy with this Mr B complained. 
NatWest responded on the same day. They explained that based on previous complaints 
raised, they felt the relationship had now broken down and that this was the trigger that 
prompted them to carry out a review of their relationship with Mr B, resulting in them 
choosing to no longer offer him their banking services. Unhappy with this, Mr B brought his 
complaint to our service.
An investigator considered Mr Bs complaint but didnt recommend it was upheld. He said 
that NatWest had acted in line with their terms and conditions, in giving Mr B 60 days notice 
that they would be closing his account. He felt the account was closed fairly, and he didnt 
think NatWest needed to provide any further reasoning than they had. 
But Mr B remained unhappy, so the case has been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate Mr B has raised a number of concerns in his correspondence. And while I have 
read and taken on board all of these, my decision will focus predominantly on NatWests 
decision to close Mr Bs account, and whether they did so fairly. 
The terms and conditions of Mr Bs account state that NatWest can choose to close a 
customers account by giving 60 days notice. NatWest wrote to Mr B on 23rd September to 
provide notice that they were going to close Mr Bs account on 22nd November. So, Im 
satisfied Mr B was given the correct amount of notice in line with the terms of his account. 
NatWest say that they will explain their reasons for closing an account, unless theres a legal 
or security reason which means they cant provide an explanation. They say that there will, 
however, be situations where it may not be appropriate or permissible for them to engage 
with customers to explain their reasoning. So based on the terms, it seems that there are 
some occasions, where NatWest may not be obliged to provide reasons for choosing to 
close an account, however, in this instance it seems they have. 
Here, NatWest have set out the different complaints Mr B has raised, and it seems that he 
has repeatedly echoed concerns that not all of his previous complaints have been 
responded to. But NatWest have provided summary evidence to show that they have 
responded to Mr Bs previous concerns, and investigated similar matters on numerous 
occasions. And that based on the volume of these multiple complaints, they feel the 
relationship has now broken down irreparably, and they have therefore exercised their right 
to close the account. Given the circumstances NatWest have set out, and the number of 
issues raised, I dont feel that this was an unreasonable conclusion for NatWest to draw. 
And, ultimately, the action they took was in line with what the terms allow NatWest to do. 
I appreciate Mr B is unhappy with NatWests decision, and would like to know more. But on 
balance, Im satisfied that NatWest have provided sufficient reasoning for choosing to close 
Mr Bs account, and have done so in line with account terms. So therefore, I wont be asking 
them to do anything further. I appreciate this may come as a disappointment to Mr B, but I 
hope Ive been able to explain clearly why Ive reached this decision.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Bs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 April 2023.
