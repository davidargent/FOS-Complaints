The complaint
Mr A complains that PSA Finance UK Limited, trading as Autobank Financial Services, wont 
let him return a car that was supplied to him under a conditional sale agreement.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr A under a conditional sale agreement with Autobank 
Financial Services that he signed in August 2020. He says that he was told by the dealer 
that he could return the car if he wasnt happy with it but when he tried to do so he had 
difficulties contacting the dealer and it then said that he couldnt return it. Hes also had 
some issues with the customer service that he received from the dealer.
Mr A complained to Autobank Financial Services but it said that the agreement that he 
signed detailed his right to withdraw from it in the first 14 days and that it was his 
responsibility to ensure that hed understood and was satisfied with the terms of the 
agreement. Mr A wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Autobank Financial Services then said that Mr A had been sent a default notice in February 
2021 but he didnt respond to it so the agreement was terminated and the car was 
repossessed in September 2021. It said that Mr A was required to pay the outstanding 
balance on his account of £4,400.22.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that it 
seemed more likely than not that Mr A had attempted to withdraw from his agreement 
outside of the 14 day window. She said that Autobank Financial Services had offered Mr A a 
payment plan for the outstanding amount of £4,400.22 and she didnt believe that it had 
acted unfairly or unreasonably so she wouldnt be asking it to do anything further. Mr A has 
asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr A signed the conditional sale agreement in August 2020 and it said: You have 
the right to withdraw from this agreement without giving any reason within a period of 
14 days stating from the day after you sing the agreement   and the procedure 
for withdrawing from the agreement was described;
Mr A says that the dealer told him that he could return the car if he wasnt happy with 
it  but hes provided no other evidence to show that the dealer had agreed that he 
could return the car and I consider that the basis on which he could withdraw from 
the agreement was clearly set out in the agreement that he signed  and Ive seen no 
evidence to show that Mr A contacted Autobank Financial Services within the 14 day 
withdrawal period to withdraw from the agreement;
Mr A says that he had difficulties contacting the dealer but the phone records that 
hes provided show that his calls to the dealer didnt start until more than 14 days 
after the car had been supplied to him so his right to withdraw from the agreement 
had expired then;
he says that he went to the dealer in October 2020 but that was more than 40 days 
after the car had been supplied to him and after his right to withdraw from the 
agreement had expired  and I dont consider that he had a right to return the car at 
that time;
Mr A has described some issues with the customer service that he received from the 
dealer when he was trying to return the car  but his complaint is made against 
Autobank Financial Services and it isnt liable for the customer service provided by 
the dealer after the car was supplied to him - so whilst I sympathise with him for the 
issues that he experienced, I cant require Autobank Financial Services to take any 
action about that service;
Mr A complained to Autobank Financial Services and it said that his account was in 
arrears and it sent a default notice to Mr A in February 2021  he didnt respond to 
the default notice so his agreement was terminated and the car was repossessed in 
September 2021  Autobank Financial Services says that the cars mileage when it 
was repossessed was 43,133 miles and that Mr A had used the car to drive 3,286 
miles since it was supplied to him;
the car was then sold at auction and the sale proceeds were applied to Mr As 
account but Autobank Financial Services says that the outstanding balance of his 
account is £4,400.22 which hes required to pay in full or via a payment plan;
I dont consider that Mr A had a right to return the car after the 14 day withdrawal 
period had ended and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
Autobank Financial Services has acted unfairly or unreasonably in its dealings with 
Mr A about the car;
I sympathise with Mr A for the issues that hes described and the difficulties that hes 
experienced, but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require Autobank Financial Services to reduce, or waive, the 
outstanding balance of his account, to pay him any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to his complaint; and
I suggest that Mr A contacts Autobank Financial Services to either pay the 
outstanding balance of his account or to try to agree an affordable repayment 
arrangement for that amount and he should explain to it any financial difficulties that 
hes experiencing  its required to respond to any such difficulties positively and 
sympathetically  if he doesnt do so I consider it to be likely than it will take further 
action (to the extent that its legally entitled to do so) to try to recover that amount 
from him.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 August 2022.
