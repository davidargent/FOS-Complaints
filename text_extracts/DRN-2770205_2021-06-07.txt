The complaint
V a limited company, complains that TransferWise Ltd closed its account and wont release 
funds held in the account.
V is represented by its director, Mr V.
What happened
In August 2020, TransferWise reviewed Vs account. TransferWise said that it would take 
around 60 days for it to complete its review. Whilst it conducted its review it blocked Vs 
account. This meant Mr V wasnt able to access funds in the account. At the time the 
account balance was just over Â£27,000.
As part of its review, TransferWise asked Mr V for information about the activity on Vs 
account, which Mr V provided. On 17 December 2020, TransferWise let Mr V know that it 
hadnt yet finished its review and would update him as soon as it could. On 6 January 2021, 
TransferWise wrote to Mr V again to let him know it was still completing due diligence 
checks and wasnt able to release Vs funds to him or remove the deactivation marker on the 
account. 
 
Mr V complained to TransferWise about how long things were taking. He said not having 
access to Vs account was making running his business difficult. TransferWise said it hadnt 
done anything wrong and was complying with its legal and regulatory obligations in 
conducting its review. It also said it had deactivated Vs account in line with the terms and 
conditions. Unhappy with this response Mr V brought Vs complaint to our service.
One of our investigators looked into the complaint. She said whilst TransferWises review 
had taken some time, she was satisfied that it had done so without any undue delays and 
had moved things along as quickly as it could. She also said TransferWise hadnt done 
anything wrong when it closed Vs account. Mr V disagreed. He wants TransferWise to 
release Vs funds and reactivate its account.
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Firstly, the investigator was right to point out that TransferWise has important legal and 
regulatory obligations it must meet when providing accounts to its customers. These 
obligations are ongoing, so do not only pertain to when an account is opened. To comply 
with its obligations TransferWise may need to review an account and/or restrict its 
customers access. If it didnt comply with its obligations it could risk serious sanction.
In order to meet these requirements TransferWise is entitled to ask a customer for more 
information about how they use their account, including payments which are made into an 
account. And its not for this service to interfere with the banks processes. Our role is to see 
if the bank has made any mistakes and then put the customer back in the position theyd 
have been in if the mistake hadnt happened.
Having looked at all the evidence, I dont believe it was unreasonable in the circumstances 
for TransferWise to block Vs account and ask Mr V for information. TransferWise has 
explained that this was its standard procedure, and I accept that it was. And having looked at 
all the evidence, Im satisfied that TransferWise did so in order to comply with its various 
legal obligations. So, whilst I accept this caused V inconvenience, I cant say TransferWise 
treated V unfairly when it blocked its account. 
The crux of Vs complaint is the amount of time TransferWise have taken so far to complete 
its review. Mr V says it has taken too long and he wants TransferWise to release Vs funds 
so that he can carry on running his business. I do accept that so far, its taken TransferWise 
a relatively lengthy period of time to review Vs account. And that TransferWise have yet to 
release Vs funds. But I dont consider that it would be right for me to conclude it shouldnt 
have taken in excess of any particular or specific timeframe. Because TransferWise is 
entitled  as a matter of principle  to do what it did in order to comply with its legal and 
regulatory obligations. 
Having looked at the information provided by TransferWise, and all the circumstances of this 
particular case,  Im satisfied that TransferWise hasnt been responsible for any undue 
delays. And that it has been progressing its review as quickly as possible. Im also satisfied 
that TransferWise has acted in accordance with its legal and regulatory obligations when its 
restricted Vs account. So, I cant say TransferWise has treated V unfairly in not releasing 
the funds in Vs account. 
I also note that TransferWise spoke to Mr V on more than one occasion about what was 
happening and explained to him that it was still completing its review and completing its due 
diligence.  I can see that the bank wrote to Mr V on at least three occasions. So, I think 
TransferWise kept him informed about what it was doing.  
I appreciate that V has been inconvenienced by TransferWise closing its account. And that 
Mr V wants the account up and running again. Ive considered whether TransferWise acted 
fairly in closing Vs account. Ive looked at the terms and conditions of the account and Im 
satisfied they did.
TransferWise can make commercial decisions about who it offers services to. They cannot 
unfairly discriminate against a customer. But they can say they no longer wish to do 
business with individuals and companies. Thats because theyve got the commercial 
freedom to decide who they want to contract with. And having looked at all the information 
and circumstances of this case, Im satisfied that TransferWise has exercised its commercial 
decision legitimately when it decided to close Vs account. So, I cannot fairly and reasonably 
say its done anything wrong when it decided it no longer wanted V as a customer and 
closed Vs account.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask V to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2021.
