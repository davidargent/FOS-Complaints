The complaint
Mrs H complains about the administration and management, by Creation Consumer Finance
Ltd (Creation), of her finance agreement and account in respect of the same.
Mrs H is represented in this complaint by a third party. But for ease I will simply refer to
Mrs H throughout this decision rather than Mrs H and her representative.
What happened
In September 2014 Mrs H purchased an item from retailer that I will call C. Mrs H
purchased this item with credit provided by Creation.
Based on system notes provided by Creation, and what the parties have said and submitted,
its my understanding that the cost of the item was £1,082,96 and Mrs H agreed to make an
advance payment of £108.30 (10%) followed by:
a single payment of £974.66 on or before 25 March 2015  total payable £974.66; or
36 monthly payments of £41.84 commencing April 2015 ending March 2018  total
payable £1,506.24
Mrs H sent Creation a cheque for £919.66, which was credited to her account on
6 March 2015. Mrs H submits that the reason she sent Creation £919.66 (rather than
£974.66) was because:
the sum of £974.66 was inclusive of an installation fee of £82
C was unable to install the item
C advised her that it would ensure an appropriate adjustment (for the lack of install)
would be made to the finance agreement with Creation
On 26 March 2015 Mrs Hs account balance, she having only paid Creation £919.66 before
this date (rather than £974.66), stood at £586.58 (£1,506.24 less £919.66).
Between April 2015 and September 2015 Mrs H paid Creation 6 monthly payments of
£41.84 totalling £251.04, taking her account balance down to £335.54.
In August 2017, and having received no further payments from Mrs H, Creation raised a
charge against Mrs Hs account of £30, taking the balance on it to £365.54.
In May 2019, and having received no further payments from Mrs H, Creation sold the debt
onto a debt collector that I will call L.
In March 2021 Mrs H referred a compliant to our service, which was considered by one of
our investigators.
In June and July 2021 our investigator wrote to Mrs H to say that he wasnt upholding her
complaint against Creation.
Mrs H disagreed with the investigators decision not to uphold her complaint against
Creation, so it was passed to me for review and decision.
I issued a provisional decision on this case in October 2022. In summary I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First I would like to make it clear that Im only considering in this complaint what, if anything,
Creation might have done wrong in its administration and management of Mrs Hs finance
agreement and account. Im not considering anything C might or might not have done wrong,
something that is being considered by our service as a separate complaint.
Secondly, I would like to point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear,
or contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
Creation has provided very little documentation in respect of Mrs Hs finance agreement, but
this isnt surprising given it was taken out in September 2014 and the outstanding debt (in
respect of it) was sold on in May 2019.
Furthermore, Mrs H has provided nothing that would lead me to conclude that Creation has
done anything wrong in its administration and management of her finance agreement and
account, for example copies of correspondence she had with Creation (rather than copies of
correspondence she had with C) or any evidence that C had been in contact with Creation.
And in respect of the latter, I cant reasonably hold Creation responsible for any failure on
the part of C to contact it.
So, Im currently of the view that on the balance of probabilities Creation has done nothing
wrong in this case and it acted entirely in line with its regulatory and legal obligations in all its
dealings with Mrs H including seeking repayment from her and relaying the consequences of
repayment not being made.
Neither party responded to my provisional findings by the date I gave.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Because neither party responded to my provisional findings by the date I gave, I can confirm 
that I see no good reason to depart from those findings and I now confirm them as final.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2023.
