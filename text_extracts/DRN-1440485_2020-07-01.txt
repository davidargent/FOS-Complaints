The complaint
Miss J complaints about the service that she received from Black Horse Limited when a car 
was being collected from her at the end of a hire purchase agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Miss J contacted Black Horse in August 2019 to arrange for the car to be collected 
but it wasnt collected until November 2019 and there were significant failings by the 
third party that Black Horse had instructed to collect the car;
it has apologised for those failings and has paid Miss J compensation totalling £400  
and in its final response letter to Miss J its complaints manager said: I would like to 
say how sorry I am that errors by an agent acting on our behalf has caused you 
considerable trouble and upset. I can assure you that our actions have not been 
intended to cause distress and inconvenience to you;
Miss J has described the effect that the delay in collecting the car has had on her and 
her family and I sympathise with for the medical problems and the other issues that 
shes had to deal with;
Black Horse has accepted responsibility for the delay in the car being collected and 
the customer service failings, its apologised for them and has paid Miss J 
compensation totalling £400  the monthly payment under the agreement was 
£141.02 so the compensation is equivalent to a refund of nearly three months 
payments;
the amount of compensation that is appropriate in circumstances such as these can 
be very subjective but I consider that Black Horses response to Miss Js complaint 
has been fair and reasonable; and
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require Black Horse to pay any more compensation to Miss J or to take any other 
action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
For these reasons, my decision is that I dont uphold Miss Js complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 July 2020.
