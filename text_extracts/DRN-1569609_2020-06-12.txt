The complaint
Miss M complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc trading as first direct wont let her open a Regular 
Saver Account over the phone and says she has to complete the application online. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Businesses are free to decide how to operate and what services to offer customers.
first direct has confirmed it only offers the Regular Saver Account to customers who
apply online. Thats a decision first direct is entitled to take.
Businesses dont have to tell consumers why a particular decision has been taken
and I wouldnt expect first direct to provide more details.
I understand Miss M has been a customer of first direct for many years but our
service cant force a business to make an exception. first direct has confirmed Miss
M can open the Regular Saver Account  online but not over the phone.
Im sorry to disappoint Miss M but Im satisfied first direct has dealt with her complaint
fairly so Im not telling it to take any further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 July 2020.
