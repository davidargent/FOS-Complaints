K821x#15complaint
Mr and Mrs M complain  they settled their accounts with National Westminster  Bank Plc but 
its now told them the settlement only applied to Mr M.
Background
On 15 May 2019 I issued  a provisional decision saying that subject to any further comments 
or evidence  from Mr and Mrs M or NatWest, I intended to uphold  this complaint. I outlined 
the background as follows:
In June 2016 Mrs M says she and her husband settled their outstanding accounts with 
NatWest by paying over £6,000. But now Mrs Ms receiving letters from a debt collection 
agency telling her she owes over £18,000.
NatWest says it reached an agreement with Mr M in 2016 that he could  settle his debts  if he 
paid 70% (£6,462)  towards his liabilities  on his joint account (with  his wife) and his two sole 
accounts. He did this and NatWest settled  his two sole accounts in full (£729.85 and 
£2,553.27). This left £3178.88, which it used to reduce  the balance  (of £5947.41) on his joint 
account. It now says Mrs M owes the outstanding balance of £2768.53.
But NatWest  said it didnt  make any such agreement with Mrs M. So it said shes still liable 
for her share of the debt on the joint account. It accepted itd made a mistake  in the figure  
she owed and it apologised. It confirmed she owes £2,768.53 on the joint account  and not 
more than £18,000.
Our investigator could  see NatWest  made  an agreement with Mr M on 1 June 2016  that he 
could pay £6,462, which was 70% of the debt he owed. But this was based  on Mr Ms 
income and expenditure only, and the agreement only covered his liabilities. Mrs M was still 
liable for her share  of the debt on their joint account.  
But he thought  NatWest should  pay £200 compensation for the upset its caused them. And 
he thought it should also correct any adverse credit  information that wouldve occurred with 
the mistake in the amount  of money  it originally  said was owed by Mrs M.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My provisional findings based on the evidence available at the time were as follows:
It seems  to me that Mr M genuinely thought that the agreement to pay 70% of his liabilities  
would close all three accounts and not just his two single accounts. And in his last phone  call 
to the investigator  he said he believed all the debts would be gone  when he agreed to make 
the payment to NatWest.
Ref: DRN06356242Although from a legal  standpoint Mrs M is jointly liable  for the debt, and so NatWest can 
pursue her for the outstanding amount, it doesnt seem fair and reasonable that it should do 
so. There arent any phone calls available from that time, but in the debt managers note 
there is an entry on 27 May 2016. It says the bank  agreed to review the situation - and 
although it makes the point it can pursue  the other  party - theres no indication  it told Mr M it 
would do that. 
Even if Mr M was aware his wife would still be liable for her share, it seems  to me that he 
wouldve thought  his offer wouldve settled 70% of his liability  on all of his accounts, instead 
of which  NatWest offset 100% against  his sole accounts and the remainder towards the joint 
account - where  it knew it could pursue  Mrs M. If itd allocated 70% towards each of the 
accounts, which was Mr Ms understanding, it shouldve  allocated  £4,163.19 towards the 
joint account. So the liability Mrs M would now be facing on that account is £1,784.22  
(£5,947.41 - £4,163.19) and not £2,768.53.
So I think the fairest way for NatWest to now put matters right is to reduce the debt Mrs M 
owes to £1,784.22 (less the £1 monthly payments made since  June 2016). And I agree with 
the investigator that it should also pay Mr and Mrs M £200 compensation for the trouble and 
upset its caused  them.
NatWest said that if Mr Ms payment had been  distributed  equally  between both his sole and 
his joint debts it would be obliged to amend his credit file to show his accounts  were only 
partially settled.
Mr M said he thought his settlement would mean that the joint account would be closed. 
Thats what  he agreed to. He said he would be happy for his credit record to be amended  
but only if Mrs Ms liability on the joint account  was written off. 
As Ive explained above, it seems that Mr M genuinely thought the payment he made in 2016 
would close all the accounts. But Im satisfied NatWest was only dealing with his debt 
liabilities and not those  of Mrs M. I think he assumed that his wifes debt on the joint account 
would be covered by this settlement. But Im satisfied  NatWest didnt tell him this. And legally 
she was responsible for half the outstanding debt at the time. 
NatWest used Mr Ms settlement payment to pay off all his debt on his two sole accounts 
and used the balance to reduce the debt on the joint account knowing it could pursue Mrs M 
for the remaining debt.  But as Ive said I dont think that was fair. The agreement Mr M had 
with NatWest was that the payment would settle  70% of the debt liability on all his accounts. 
So I think its only fair that the payment  should  be apportioned equally between  his two sole 
accounts and his joint account  with Mrs M. That would  now reduce her liability  to £1,784.22  
(less the £1 monthly payments  made  since June 2016)
NatWest is obliged to report  accurate information to the credit reference  agencies so I cant  
tell it not to amend Mr Ms credit record if he and Mrs M accept my decision.  I can only tell it 
to ensure that the information it reports is in line with my decision. And for the reasons Ive 
explained, I cant fairly tell it to write  off Mrs Ms liability.  
Ref: DRN06356243my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint.
To put matters right National Westminster Bank Plc should reduce Mrs Ms debt to 
£1,784.22 (less the £1 monthly  payments made since  June  2016)  and pay Mr and Mrs M 
£200 compensation.
Any adverse  information on Mr and Mrs Ms credit  files relevant to my decision should  also 
be removed.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs M to 
accept or reject my decision  before  9 August  2019.
