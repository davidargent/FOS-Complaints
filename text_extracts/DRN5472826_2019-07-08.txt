K820x#14Complaint
Mrs M says Cash On Go Limited (trading  as Peachy) lent to her irresponsibly.
Background
This complaint is about five short-term instalment loans which Peachy provided to Mrs M 
between October 2012 and May 2014.  Mrs Ms lending  history is as follows:
Peachy did not lend to Mrs M after loan 5.
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold this complaint. Mrs M disagreed with our adjudicators opinion 
and asked for an ombudsman to decide  the case, so the complaints been passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice  on our website. 
Peachy needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs M 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
In this case, I think the checks carried out were reasonable for loans 1, 2, and 5. These 
loans were not especially large, and were either only a small increase or significant decrease 
in amounts from Mrs Ms previous borrowing. And they didnt make  up a particularly  
substantial proportion of her income.
Its possible that Peachy  shouldve  done  more in terms of checks for loans 3 and 4, such  as 
getting details  of Mrs Ms living expenses. But from what Ive seen  and from the information 
Mrs M later gave  Peachy  about her living costs,  I think such checks  wouldve shown that she 
had enough money after her living  costs  to reliably meet the repayments. 
Up until the last loan, Mrs M made her repayments  on time or even early,  with the exception 
of one payment  which was a single day late. And it doesnt look like there was any indication 
that Mrs M was in financial difficulties which Peachy shouldve been aware of. So I dont 
think that more comprehensive  proportionate  checks wouldve made a difference  here.Loan Date  opened Date  closedAmount

Ref: DRN54728262Mrs Ms borrowing increased  from loans 1 to 3, but not by a lot. Then there was a gap of six 
and a half months between Mrs M repaying  loan 3 and taking out loan 4, which  is a relatively 
significant gap in time considering she had been borrowing from Peachy for less than eight  
months before this pause. Given how long Mrs M had gone without borrowing from Peachy, 
I dont think they shouldve been concerned that she was reliant on these loans when she 
asked for loan 4. And, although it was for the largest amount shed asked for so far, she told 
Peachy her monthly income had increase  substantially. And then her borrowing reduced 
significantly from loan 4 to loan 5.
I understand Mrs M had difficulties repaying  loan 5. But at the time she took it out, it doesnt  
look like there  was any significant indication which Peachy shouldve been aware of that 
shed get into difficulties. I can see Peachy set up a payment  plan with her to clear  loan 5, 
and then didnt  lend to her again.
I also understand that Mrs M may have  had other  debts at the time. But given the 
information shed  provided, the size of the loan payments relative  to her income, the length  
of time she borrowed over, and her loan history, I dont think there  was sufficient reason for 
Peachy to look into what other debts she might have. Her income and expenditure 
suggested the loans were  affordable  at the time, and I have not found that they were 
irresponsibly lent.
My final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained above, I dont uphold Mrs Ms complaint in this case.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 August 2019.
