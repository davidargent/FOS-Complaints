K821x#15Complaint
Mr L says Quidie Limited lent to him irresponsibly.
Background
Mr L had five loans  with Quidie; Ive summarised  some of the information Quidie provided 
about the loans in the table below.
Loan  no. Amount Start date End date
1 £100 13/11/2017 24/11/2017
2 £100 24/11/2017 29/12/2017
3 £300 02/01/2018 26/01/2018
4 £500 26/01/2018 23/02/2018
5 £600 23/02/2018 n/a
An adjudicator considered  the complaint and recommended it be upheld in part. He didnt 
think loans 3 to 5 were  lent responsibly.  Mr L accepted this outcome but Quidie, despite  
reminders, didnt respond. The complaint was therefore passed  to me to decide.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending  including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Quidie  needed to 
take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should 
have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr L could repay  his loans in a 
sustainable manner.  Additionally, there may come a point where  pattern  of lending itself 
clearly demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Having considered everything  I agree  with the adjudicator that, had Quidie properly 
considered all the information it had about Mr Ls financial situation, it wouldve concluded he 
was having problems manging his money. He was indebted to multiple  other short-term  
lenders and had opened  (or applied for) around  100 other loan accounts before turning to 
Quidie.
I dont think this necessarily means  that loans 1 and 2 were lent irresponsibly. On balance, 
I think its likely proportionate checks wouldve shown these to be sustainably affordable, 
given that they were  both for only £100  and were approved  early  in the lending relationship.
But by loan 3 the amount Mr L was borrowing was increasing. He was also, for the second 
time, applying for a new loan as soon as he settled the preceding loan, which  suggested he 
was struggling to settle his loans sustainably, or had wider  financial difficulties. 
This pattern of borrowing  continued for loans 4 and 5, with both loans granted on the same 
day Mr L repaid the proceeding  loan and with Mr L ultimately borrowing five and then six 
times more  than his first loan. So it was likely Mr Ls indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
Bearing in mind what Quidie knew about Mr L borrowing history  (with it and elsewhere), 
Ref: DRN67698742I dont think it acted  responsibly or fairly  by approving loans 3 to 5. And I think Mr L lost out 
because he was provided with loans which were  not sustainably  affordable.  So Im upholding 
the complaint  about loans 3 to 5.
Putting things  right
For loans 3 and 4 Quidie should:
refund  the interest and charges Mr L paid
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when Mr L paid the interest 
and charges until the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  it has recorded from Mr Ls credit history
For loan 5:
I understand Loan 5 has an outstanding  balance.  So Quidie should remove any interest and 
charges and treat any payments made  as if they were payments towards the principal. If it 
hasnt sold the debt to a third party, it can deduct  the refund for loans 3 and 4 from the 
principal balance of loan 5. Id encourage Mr L and Quidie to then engage in a constructive 
discussion about the repayment  of the remaining balance of loan 5.
If Quidie has sold loan 5 to a third party,  it should buy it back  if it is able to do so. If it cant 
buy back the debt it will need  to liaise with the debt owner to make sure the most Mr L pays 
to settle loan 5 is the £600  he originally borrowed. If Mr L has already paid more  than £600 
towards 
loan 5, Quidie  should refund the difference to Mr L, adding 8% simple interest from the date 
of the overpayment(s) until the date of settlement. Quidie will also have to liaise  with the 
debt owner to remove any adverse information  it has recorded about loan 5  although its 
fair to continue to report the debt until its settled.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Quidie to take off tax from this interest. Quidie must give 
Mr L a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold Mr Ls complaint in part. Quidie Limited must put things right by taking  the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 18 August 2019.
