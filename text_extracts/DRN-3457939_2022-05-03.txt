trading as Virgin Money. He would like more compensation than Virgin Money has paid.
..
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known so I wont repeat these again here instead I will 
focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:-
Virgin Money upheld Mr Ms complaint as it said its systems were down on the day in 
question which explained the issues Mr M had accessing his account. The main 
issue here is the level of compensation as Mr M doesnt feel the  £50 Virgin Money 
has paid is  sufficient
I do appreciate it must have been both stressful and inconvenient for Mr M not to 
have been able to access his account details and the time spent on the phone to try 
to resolve this.
But Mr M hasnt given us any evidence of any other impact, for example any loss due 
to not being able to make transactions, that I could consider. So, on that basis I think 
the £50 Virgin Money has paid is reasonable for the inconvenience suffered.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint Your text here
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 May 2022.
