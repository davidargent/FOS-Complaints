K821x#15complaint
Mr N has complained about Wealth At Work Limited. He says that it delayed the transfer of 
his pension causing him loss.
background
On 22 March 2018, My Wealth received Mr Ns transfer request from his new pension  
provider. Ill refer to that business as B2.
The bulk of the transfer was completed  on 4 May 2018, with the final payment  being made 
on 6 June 2018. In total,  the transfer  process  took 11 weeks.  My Wealth  said that it hadnt 
caused any unnecessary delay at any point, explaining that the time taken was the result  of 
its due diligence  process and late trading.
The adjudicator who invested the complaint  didnt  agree and decided that it should be 
upheld. He said that there was an issue with My Wealths due diligence  request, and that B2 
had to repeatedly  chase  My Wealth in order to progress the transfer. The complication 
seems to have been that My Wealths due diligence  request to B2 was obscure  and it had 
difficulty understanding it. 
The adjudicator determined that the transfer should have been completed within 4 weeks  
and not 11. He said that My Wealth should  compensate Mr N for the any loss caused by the 
delay in the transfer. This would involve  calculating the transfer value on 23 April 2018. He 
also said that My Wealth should  pay Mr N £150 for any distress  and inconvenience caused.
My Wealth  didnt agree. It didnt accept that the due diligence request was obscure. It had 
received the due diligence responses  from B2 on 23 and 24 April 2018.  It accepted  that any 
issues with those responses could have been escalated internally at that point and not later.  
But even then, it would normally  take 7 days for payment to be made to the new scheme.  
This would have taken  up to 2 May 2018  and the bulk of the transfer was made by 4 May 
2018. 
It accepted that there was a delay  in transferring some of the funds  totalling  £8,923.51. 
There was then a final payment  of £9,172.08 on 6 June 2018. It offered to pay Mr N a sum 
equal to the loss of growth he may have sustained on £8,923.51 between  2 May 2018  and 6 
June 2018.  
As no agreement has been reached the case has been referred to me for a decision. I made 
a provisional decision  as follows.
Provisional decision
In deciding what is fair and reasonable I must take into account relevant law and regulations; 
regulators rules,  guidance and standards; codes of practice; and what  I consider to have 
been good industry practice at the time. I dont think it would  be fair to penalise My Wealth  
for applying  standards of due diligence  which  may have been  higher than the norm  at the 
time. I dont agree  that their requirements  were obscure. I think  Mr N would prefer that My 
Wealth did more, rather than less, to protect his pension which,  no doubt, is a very valuable 
asset to him.
Ref: DRN11095812Im not currently satisfied that My Wealth was responsible for delays up to 23 April 2018. It 
seems to accept that it could have acted more quickly at that point if issues about  the due 
diligence had been escalated internally. It says that if this had happened, the bulk of the 
transfer may have  been completed  2 days earlier.
Once due diligence was completed  the transfer took place within  11 days and My Wealth  
accepts that it may have  been completed sooner, but only by 2 days.
The bulk of the transfer value was paid out on 4 May 2018. Information from B2 suggests the 
funds were visible to them  on that date and not on the 17 May 2018  as has been 
suggested. Ive not seen  anything that persuades me that B2 only received  the bulk of the 
transfer on 17 May 2018. 
The shortfall on the full transfer  value was £8,923.51. A final payment was made on 6 June 
2018 of £9,172.08. I anticipate this included some growth on the funds withheld.
It seems  to me that any loss to Mr N would be the difference between £8,923.51  together 
with any growth he would have achieved on that sum between 4 May 2018 and 6 June 2018, 
minus the £9,172.08 that was actually  transferred.
An index that this service commonly uses when assessing redress in cases like this is the 
FTSE UK Private  Investor  Income Index total return.  This index  demonstrates growth over 
the period between 4 May 2018 and 6 June  2018  of around 1.5 per cent. If that is applied to 
the shortfall of £8,923.51, then growth  would be £133.85. So, giving a total of £9,057.36, but 
this is less than the £9,172.08 that was actually transferred on 6 June 2018.  So, on this 
basis there would appear to be no loss due to the delay.
Any transfer like this will involve monies being  disinvested for a period.  In this case the bulk 
of the transfer  value  appears to have  been  disinvested for up to 11 days. I dont think that is 
an unreasonably long period. A small portion of the transfer value was delayed apparently 
due to late trading,  but its not clear  to me that Mr N lost out as a result. My Wealth has 
offered to compensate Mr N for any loss of growth on this portion of the transfer value.  I 
think this offer is fair in principle although,  based upon the index Ive applied,  its not clear  to 
me that there is any loss. 
I appreciate Mr N or his representative may wish to provide evidence  of loss assuming  the 
£8,923.51 had been invested with B2 sooner. Id be happy to consider that. But at present 
its not clear to me that My Wealth was responsible for delaying the bulk of the transfer  and 
its not clear that Mr N has lost out because of the delay in transferring the balance of the 
transfer value.
Mr Ns response
Mr Ns representative responded and said, in summary:
Due to the nature  and diversity of the holdings, disinvestment must have occurred 
some time before 4 May 2018.
My Wealth hasnt  provided documentary evidence to show  that disinvestment was 
only made on 25 April 2018.
The bulk of the transfer wasnt made until 17 May 2018.
Ref: DRN11095813my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done that, I see no reason to 
change my provisional conclusions. I uphold this complaint in part.
My Wealth  has provided documentary evidence that the funds were  still invested on 23 April 
2018 and this has been shared with Mr Ns representatives. Im satisfied that disinvestment 
didnt take place before 25 April 2018  as it says, it cant have taken place  before 23 April 
2018. Despite  any conjecture to the contrary,  there  is no evidence that disinvestment took 
place any earlier than 25 April 2018.
Im satisfied, on balance, that the bulk of the transfer  value was paid on 4 May 2018. Mr Ns 
representative restates that the funds werent  received by B2 until 17 May 2018. It provides 
a further message to this effect  from B2. But B2s statements are inconsistent  with its own 
records that also record that the funds  were visible to them  on 4 May 2018.  Ive not seen 
anything that persuades  me that B2 only received  the bulk of the transfer on 17 May 2018. If 
the funds were visible to it, the funds must have been received? No explanation  to the 
contrary has been provided.
Mr Ns representatives and B2 agree the dates of the remaining partial  transfers.
I note the comments about  the delay in making the final balancing transfer, but I did suggest 
that Mr N or his representative  may wish to provide evidence of loss assuming the £8,923.51  
had been invested with B2 sooner. That hasnt happened and, as I said, its not clear to me 
that Mr N has lost out because of the delay in transferring the balance of the transfer value. 
My calculations showed no loss.
Im asked to reinstate  the adjudicators view, but I dont agree  with it and Ive set out why.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. My Wealth Limited must pay Mr N £150 for the inconvenience  
caused by the delays  in the transfer. I dont make any further award.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 April 2021.
