The complaint
Mr H has complained about a number of loans he took from Western Circle Limited trading 
as Cashfloat. Mr H says Cashfloat lent to him irresponsibly.
 
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in May 2020 that I summarise below.
Mr H was given 6 loans by Cashfloat between November 2014 and June 2016. The loans 
were all repayable in instalments of between three or four months. The principal sum 
borrowed varied from £300 to £600.
A summary of Mr H's borrowing is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments AmountMonthly 
Repayment
1 24/11/2014 15/02/2015 3 £500.00 £218.49
2 17/02/2015 15/07/2015 4 £600.00 £238.33
3 29/07/2015 16/10/2015 3 £300.00 £139.09

5 09/03/2016 15/06/2016 3 £300.00 £154.75
6 17/06/2016 14/10/2016 3 £400.00 £196.86
 
In my provisional decision I explained why I thought the complaint should be partly upheld. 
I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, in particular the checks that 
Cashfloat needed to do such as the amount being lent, and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, I thought less thorough checks might be reasonable and 
proportionate in the early stages of the lending relationship.
I thought that the checks that Cashfloat carried out for loans 1-4 were proportionate. So I 
didnt think there was any reason why the lender should have declined those applications.  
But I didnt think Cashfloat should have agreed to loans 5 or 6. 
I thought by the time that Mr H made his fifth consecutive application for a short-term loan 
with Cashfloat, the lender should have realised that it couldnt rely on the financial 
information that Mr H was providing and it should have taken steps to independently verify 
his financial circumstances  for example by requesting bank statements. 
Having reviewed the bank statements that Mr H provided to this service, I said that if 
Cashfloat had carried out more thorough checks when Mr H applied for loan 5, it would have 
seen that he was repeatedly borrowing from other short term lenders and paying a 
significant amount every month to repay these other loans. Mr Hs bank statements also 
indicated other financial difficulties. I thought that proportionate checks would have shown 
Cashfloat that Mr H was having difficulty managing his finances and that he was most likely 
borrowing to repay other lending  and so would most likely have needed to borrow 
elsewhere to repay his loans from Cashfloat. I thought the lender ought reasonably to have 
realised that it was unlikely that Mr H wouldve been able to sustainably repay this loan  or 
any subsequent lending. 
 
I also thought that by loan 6 the pattern of lending meant that by then, Mr H had been 
indebted to Cashfloat for over 18 months. And that by agreeing to loan 6, Cashfloat was 
effectively prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness, by allowing him to take expensive credit over an 
extended period. I thought it should have been clear to Cashfloat that by the time he applied 
for loan 6, Mr H was no longer borrowing to meet a short-term, emergency need, but that he 
was most likely borrowing to keep up with ongoing financial commitments. And as a 
responsible lender, Cashfloat should have reasonably questioned whether it should continue 
to offer short-term loans to this consumer, whose repeated borrowing suggested that by 
then, he had become reliant on the lending - which the rules and guidance made clear 
should only be for a short term purpose.
Since I issued my provisional decision I have seen further details of the credit checks the 
lender performed before agreeing the loans. Those checks do show that Mr H faced some 
problems managing his money earlier in 2014. But on balance I dont think those problems 
were serious enough, or sufficiently recent, for me to conclude Cashfloat shouldnt have 
given the early loans to Mr H.
I invited both parties to send me any further comments or evidence. Mr H has told us he has 
nothing further to add. Cashfloat says it accepts my provisional findings.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Given that Cashfloat has agreed with my provisional decision, and Mr H has nothing further 
to add, I confirm the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision:
I am not upholding uphold Mr Hs complaint about loans 1 to 4.
Cashfloat should not have agreed to provide loans 5 or 6. So Cashfloat needs to pay 
Mr H some compensation.
 
Putting things right
For the loan taken on 9th March 2016 (loan 5) and the loan taken on 17th June 2016 (loan 
6) Cashfloat should:
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr H on the loans.Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement. HM Revenue & Customs requires 
Cashfloat to take off tax from this interest. Cashfloat must give Mr H a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Remove any adverse information about loan 5 from Mr Hs credit file.
The overall pattern of borrowing means that any information about loan 6 is adverse, 
so all entries about loan 6 should be removed from Mr Hs credit file.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mr Hs complaint and direct Western Circle Limited 
trading as Cashfloat to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 23rd July 2020.
