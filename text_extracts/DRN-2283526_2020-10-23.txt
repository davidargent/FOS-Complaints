The complaint
Miss H complains that Hyperformance Limited (trading as Insure Your Motor) mishandled
her motor insurance policy.
What happened
The Financial Ombudsman Service deals with a consumer complaint against one regulated
financial firm at a time. In our final decision we name that firm, but we dont name any other
party.
Miss H had a prestige car. She didnt have a no-claims discount. She went online and found
a quote for motor insurance. Hyperformance acted as an intermediary between her and the
insurance company in setting up a policy for a year.
On about 16 May 2019 Miss H made an initial payment to Hyperformance. She entered into
a credit agreement with a finance company for the balance of the premium.
On about 19 July 2019 Miss H sold the car and cancelled the policy. She complained that
Hyperformance had said cancellation would cost £50.00  but then asked her to pay a
cancellation fee of £125.00 and a total of £651.30.
Hyperformance sent a final response dated 16 August 2019. Unhappy with that, Miss H
brought her complaint to us in September 2019.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld in part. He didnt think it
was unreasonable for Hyperformance to ask Miss H to pay the £651.30 for the cancellation
of the credit agreement.
But he thought that the industry standard fee for cancellation of the policy would normally be
£50.00 to £75.00. And he thought it was fair for Miss H to be charged £50.00 as the policy
only ran for two months. He recommended that  from its cancellation fee of £125.00 -
Hyperformance should reduce the amount owed by Miss H by £75.00 to £50.00.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence, I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Miss H 
and to Hyperformance on 22 September 2020. I summarise my findings:
The adjustment of discount is £396.80 - a 50% claw-back of the discount of £739.59. 
I didnt find that this is in line with the terms of business, which mentioned an 
adjustment to reflect time on cover.
The discount of £739.59 equates to about £61.63 per month. As the time on cover 
was just over two months, a pro-rata claw-back wouldve been about £130.00. So I 
was minded to direct Hyperformance to reduce the claw-back from £396.80 to 
£130.00 - that is to allow a further £266.80 to Miss H.
Subject to any further information from Miss H or from Hyperformance, my provisional 
decision was that I was minded to uphold this complaint in part. I intended to direct 
Hyperformance Limited to:
1. not ask Miss H to pay the balance of £651.30; and
2. deduct £266.80 from that balance;
3. not ask Miss H to pay any more than a further £384.50 in relation to the cancelled 
policy.
Neither Miss H nor Hyperformance has responded to the provisional decision. I see no 
reason to change my view.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
At the outset, Miss H paid Hyperformance £599.13. She agreed to pay the finance company
11 instalments of £269.06 (that is a further £2,959.66). So the total cost to her was going to
be £3,558.79. That consisted of the following:
Premium £3,694.23
Broker fee      £ 95.00
Broker discount  (£ 793.59)
Sub-total £2,995.64
Interest    £563.15
Total £3,558.79
From the call recording and a screenshot, Im satisfied that Hyperformance did enough to
draw Miss Hs attention to its terms of business. Those terms said that if she cancelled within
the 14-day cooling-off period there would be a cancellation fee of £50.00 and after that
period there would be a cancellation fee of £125.00.
The Hyperformance terms of business also said the following:
Any discounts offered at the inception of the policy will be adjusted to reflect the time
on cover, as all discounts are offered subject to you maintaining the policy for the
agreed duration.
The Hyperformance terms of business also said that cancellation might cause the insurance
company to charge a Short Period Rate for the time on cover. That meant that the
insurance company might charge more for a short period than it wouldve charged for that
period if it were part of a completed policy year.
Its likely that Miss H paid 2 instalments of £269.06 to the finance company in June and July
2019.
Miss H cancelled after a little more than 2 months of the policy year. Hyperformance said the
balance owed by Miss H was as follows:
Balance due to finance company  £1,976.62
Adjustment of discount    £ 396.80Cancellation fee    £ 125.00
Sub-total  £2,498.42
Refund from insurance company (£1,847.12)
Balance due from Miss H    £ 651.30
The balance due to the finance company looks reasonable. Miss H was going to pay 11
instalments of £269.06 (£2,959.66). I think she paid 2 instalments of £269.06 (£538.12). A
further 9 instalments of £269.06 wouldve been £2,421.54. And £1 ,976.62 is less than that,
probably because of a rebate of interest for early repayment.
The adjustment of discount is £396.80 - a 50% claw-back of the discount of £739.59. I dont
find that this is in line with the terms of business, which mentioned an adjustment to reflect
time on cover.
The discount of £739.59 equates to about £61.63 per month. As the time on cover was just
over two months, a pro-rata claw-back wouldve been about £130.00. So I will direct 
Hyperformance to reduce the claw-back from £396.80 to £130.00 - that is to allow a
further £266.80 to Miss H.
Ive thought about adding interest at our usual rate. But I havent seen any evidence that
Miss H paid Hyperformance the balance of £651.30 or was out of pocket. So I dont find it 
fair and reasonable to direct payment of interest to her.
The cancellation fee of £125.00 is higher than I would expect. But from the call recordings
Im satisfied that Hyperformance specifically drew it to Miss Hs attention when she took out
the policy. And I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Hyperformance to reduce it in 
addition to reducing the claw-back of discount.
The refund from the insurance company of £1,847.12 is 50% of the premium of £3,694.23
for the year. So the insurance company has charged the other 50% for just over two months
on cover. A pro-rata rate wouldve been about £616.00. So if the insurance company hadnt
charged its short-term rate, there wouldve been no balance due from Miss H at all.
The Financial Ombudsman Service generally finds it fair for an insurance company to charge
pro-rata for time on cover  not a short-term rate. But I dont hold Hyperformance
responsible for the short-term rate charged by the insurance company. Miss H may wish to
take that up with the insurance company and if necessary bring a complaint to us.
Putting things right
The adjustment of discount is £396.80 - a 50% claw-back of the discount of £739.59. I dont
find that this is in line with the terms of business, which mentioned an adjustment to reflect
time on cover.
The discount of £739.59 equates to about £61.63 per month. As the time on cover was just
over two months, a pro-rata claw-back wouldve been about £130.00. So I will direct 
Hyperformance to reduce the claw-back from £396.80 to £130.00 - that is to allow a
further £266.80 to Miss H.
Ive thought about adding interest at our usual rate. But I havent seen any evidence that
Miss H paid Hyperformance the balance of £651.30 or was out of pocket. So I dont find it 
fair and reasonable to direct payment of interest to her.
My final decisionFor the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct Hyperformance Limited to:
1. not ask Miss H to pay the balance of £651.30; and
2. deduct £266.80 from that balance;
3. not ask Miss H to pay any more than a further £384.50 in relation to the cancelled 
policy.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 November 2020.
