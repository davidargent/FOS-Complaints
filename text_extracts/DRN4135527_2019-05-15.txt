K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains about the short term loans  he took out with CashEuroNet  UK LLC trading as 
QuickQuid. Mr M says that QuickQuid shouldve  identified that he was dependent on short  
term lending and not lent to him. 
background
Mr M took out nine payday loans between November 2015  and June 2018.  Some  of the 
loans had two repayments, there was a smaller repayment followed by a larger one. Some 
of the information QuickQuid  has given  us is shown in the table below:

QuickQuid has looked at Mr Ms complaint and said that it shouldnt be upheld. It said that it 
did appropriate checks for all of the loans. And these checks  showed  that the lending was 
affordable based  on Mr Ms declared monthly income. It also said that it didnt think Mr M 
was dependent on short term lending and he hadnt told it about any financial hardship  he 
mayve had. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ms complaint and recommended that QuickQuid refund 
the interest and charges that he paid on loan 4 and loans 6 to 9. QuickQuid didnt agree with 
this and so the case  has come  to me, as an ombudsman,  for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Having done so, Ive decided to partially  uphold Mr Ms complaint. Having reviewed the 
evidence I have available I think QuickQuid was wrong to have  given Mr M loan 4 and loans 
6 to 9. Ill explain  why.
One of our adjudicators looked  at what Mr M and QuickQuid said. She thought  Mr Ms 
complaint should  be partially upheld. She thought  that it had made proportionate checks  for 
loans 1 and 2. So she thought that QuickQuids decisions to lend were reasonable. 
Ref: DRN41355272She didnt  think that QuickQuid had made  proportionate  checks  for loans 3 to 9. She thought  
if it had then it wouldnt have agreed to lend Mr M money for loan 4 and loans 6 to 9. This is 
because she didnt  think that Mr M could afford the repayments. 
QuickQuid didnt, at first, comment on our adjudicators findings about the proportionality of 
its checks or the affordability  of the loans at first and it didnt provide any new information for 
me to consider. It responded to our adjudication  saying:
  In response to FOS assessment which recommends CashEuroNet UK uphold  loans 
which were funded after March 2015,  we regret to inform you that we cannot agree to FOS 
recommendations. Please note that in CashEuroNet UKs  initial  response to FOS we 
provided detailed  information indicating why the loans were  responsibly lent to Mr M
QuickQuid first mentioned  this argument in its business submissions  to us in which  it said:
We started implementing changes to affordability assessment in June  2014  and all the 
changes were completed by Feb 28th 2015. Starting 1st March  2015 before Mr M borrowed 
his first loan,  QuickQuid had implemented an affordability review that is consistent with the 
FCA Handbook and that was in place at the time we received authorisation by the FCA. We 
confirm that this assessment was conducted  properly  and individually  for each of these last 
nine loans
QuickQuid provided  further detail about the checks  it had made when it approved  loans from 
2015 onwards  in a document called CEU Lending  Criteria and Proportional Checks.  And 
some time after the opinion it provided  detail on how it had looked  at Mr Ms credit  
commitments using  the information it had received from credit  reference agencies. These 
responses didnt  change our adjudicators opinion.
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic  argument  directly and through 
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to expand on this point any further here, though  I 
have considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. 
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Ms complaint and what both parties have said 
about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr M borrowed the loans in question.  Bearing  in mind 
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect  a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect QuickQuid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
-the higher  the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
Turning to the specifics of Mr Ms complaint. Mr M didnt disagree with our adjudicators  
opinion about  loans 1 to 3 and loan 5. Because of this I dont think there is any ongoing  
Ref: DRN41355273disagreement about these loans. So I wont be making a decision  about them.  But they were 
part of the borrowing relationship Mr M had with QuickQuid. So they are something I will take 
into account when  considering the other loans he took.
QuickQuid says: 
it recorded Mr Ms monthly income as being £750. It recorded his monthly  
expenditure as £325 before loans 1 to 3 and £475 for the remainder
it validated the information it obtained using credit reference  agency data
it used the information  it had gained  from the credit reference   agency  to confirm  the 
amount Mr M had provided  as his credit  commitments. Although in the information it 
gave to me it doesnt seem to have made any changes to the amounts Mr M 
provided. 
my findings about loans 4 and 6 to 9
Mr M has provided some information about his financial circumstances this includes his bank 
statements and a recent credit report. Having looked  at this information I think  its 
reasonable to say that what QuickQuid had recorded about Mr Ms circumstances wasnt  too 
far away from his actual income  and expenditure. So I also think its reasonable to assess 
this case based  on the income and expenditure amounts that QuickQuid recorded. 
So I havent looked into whether QuickQuid made  proportionate  checks for loans 4 to 9. This 
is because I dont need to do so. 
I can see that there was a significant  break in the lending between loans 3 and 4. But Mr M 
borrowed a just under half of his income. And QuickQuid recorded  that Mr M had a 
disposable income of £275 and the final largest repayment to this loan was around £375.  So 
this repayment  was a significant  amount more than he would have left over.  
  
QuickQuids thinks that Mr M shouldve been  able to put money aside on the earlier, lower, 
loan repayment  so he could make the final higher repayment. But Mr M would need almost 
all of his spare income over both months to make these repayments. I think this is unrealistic 
and I dont think it was reasonable  for QuickQuid  to assume that Mr M would be able to do 
this.
So I dont  think it would  be reasonable to say that Mr M could sustainably  make the 
repayments to this loan 4. So Im upholding Mr Ms complaint about this loan. 
And I dont  think it was reasonable to say that Mr M would be putting money aside on the 
later loans when  hed continued to borrow. I can see that the amounts he took were  lower. 
But the highest repayments for loans 6 to 9 left him with less than £100 in the month  they 
were due. And for loan 8 the final repayment was more  than what  QuickQuid recorded he 
had left over. 
So I think its more likely  for loans  6 to 9 that Mr M hadnt been able to put money aside on 
the lower loan repayments. And he was borrowing again to cover the gap  repaying  the 
loans had left in his finances. So I dont think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to have 
assumed he could sustainably repay loans 6 to 9 in this way. So Im also upholding Mr Ms 
complaint about  these  loans. 
Ref: DRN41355274what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
To put things right for Mr M, QuickQuid should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loan 4 and loans 6 to 9; and
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement*;
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ms credit file about  these loans;
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr M a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ms complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 June  2019.
