The complaint
Mr S complains that Quidie Limited, trading as Fernovo, sent a refund to an account thats 
closed.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know it will disappoint Mr S, but I agree with the investigators opinion. Ill explain why.
Where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear, or contradictory, as some of it is here I 
have to base my decision on the balance of probabilities.
I can understand how frustrating it must be for Mr S to be struggling to access the refund he 
expected but from the evidence Ive been provided I am persuaded that Quidie have 
returned the money and have returned it to a live account.
Thats because Ive seen evidence of the transfer from the business that includes the 
technical references, and Ive seen evidence from the business that the funds didnt bounce 
back to them, as theyve explained would be the case with a closed account. Whilst I can 
see that by February 2020 Mr S had reduced the balance to zero in the account Quidie paid 
the money to, I dont think hes evidenced the closure of the account.
Quidie accept that they didnt pay the refund into the account Mr S had asked them to pay it 
to, but I think the evidence suggests the money was paid to an open account of Mr Ss. He 
should therefore be able to access that money by contacting his bank with the technical 
references Quidie have provided. 
Im not therefore asking Quidie to take any further action.
 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 January 2023.
