The complaint
The trustees of H, a charity, complain on its behalf. Briefly, they say that Coutts & 
Companys delays meant that H missed out on the opportunity to pay £1 million (rather than 
£500,000) into a one year fixed rate bond with another firm. I will call that other firm W. 
What happened
I understand that everyone agrees:
As at 9 September 2020, W offered a one year fixed rate bond with an interest rate of 
0.65%. That was considerably higher than the interest rate Coutts paid on Hs bank 
account.
Hs trustees knew that W needed to receive all the money H wanted to put into the 
bond before close of business on 10 September 2020.
Hs trustees attempted to transfer the following amounts from Hs Coutts bank 
account to W:
o9 September 2020: £10,000 using faster payments 
o9 September 2020: £490,000 using CHAPS (this payment was ultimately 
returned by W)
o10 September 2020: £250,000 using faster payments
o10 September 2020: £240,000 using faster payments.
All the transfers using faster payments reached W on the day they were made, and 
ultimately went into Hs one year fixed rate bond with W. That meant the bond was 
opened with a balance of £500,000.
The £490,000 CHAPS payment was returned to Hs Coutts bank account, and never 
reached Hs fixed rate bond with W. There has been some confusion about exactly 
when Hs trustees became aware that the £490,000 was back in Hs Coutts account, 
and there is also been confusion about why the payment was returned in the first 
place. But there has never been any dispute about the fact the money was eventually 
returned.
Hs trustees said they had wanted to put a total of £1 million into the one year fixed rate bond 
with W. They complained that Coutts error had caused the return of the CHAPS payment, 
with the result that the money they attempted to transfer could not be used to purchase the 
one year bond with W. Coutts did not uphold the complaint, so the trustees referred the 
matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
To resolve the complaint, the trustees would like Coutts to pay H £2,500  that is, the 
difference between the amount H would have received in interest had it put £1 million into 
the W bond for one year, and the amount H actually received on £1 million split between the 
W bond and Hs Coutts bank account.
One of our investigators looked at Hs complaint, but she didnt recommend that Coutts 
make a payment to H. She said:
She didnt think it was clear that Coutts had made an error at all. She accepted that 
there a discrepancy of some kind with a sort code, but she didnt think it was clear 
that Coutts was responsible for that discrepancy. She noted that there has been no 
complaint about W, and so she was not able to investigate the actions of W.
However, even if she had been able to find evidence to show that Coutts was entirely 
responsible for the fact the £490,000 CHAPS payment was returned, she still 
wouldnt have held Coutts responsible for Hs loss of interest  because she didnt 
think the sort code issue had prevented H from transferring £1 million to W before the 
deadline.
She was satisfied that Hs trustees could have transferred a total of £1 million to W 
before the deadline despite the issues with the CHAPs transfer. She thought that on 
the morning of 10 September 2020 Hs trustees knew that W had rejected the 
£490,000 payment. They may not have known that the £490,000 was already back in 
Hs Coutts bank account  but H had access to other funds which the trustees could 
have used to make up the £1 million balance. She didnt think it would be fair to hold 
Coutts responsible for the trustees decision not to transfer those other funds to W. 
Hs trustees did not accept our investigators conclusions. Briefly, they said:
The reason the first CHAPS payment was for £490,000 rather than £1 million was 
that, as of the morning of 9 September 2020, the trustees had not yet decided to pay 
£1 million into the W fixed rate bond. Their decision to top up the payment from 
£500,000 to £1 million was only made late in the evening of 9 September 2020.
They were not told that their £490,000 CHAPS payment had failed until the morning 
of 10 September. At that point, they knew that although W had received the funds it 
could not accept them (because the funds had come from a sort code that was 
different to the sort code of Hs Coutts bank account). They did not know on 
10 September that W had already returned the £490,000 to Hs Coutts bank 
account; they only knew that W intended to return the funds.
They could not have paid an additional £500,000 to W by the deadline of 10 
September. Firstly, they did not know that the CHAPS payment had already been 
returned  and secondly, the other funds in Hs account were already earmarked for 
other investment purposes. It would have been irresponsible of them as trustees to 
have made a further investment of £500,000 without knowing that the charitys 
£490,000 CHAPS payment had been returned.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to the same overall conclusions as our investigator. The 
difficulties over the CHAPs transfer are unfortunate, but I dont think those difficulties 
prevented Hs trustees from transferring £1 million to W before the deadline had they wanted 
to do so. I am satisfied that on the morning of 10 September 2020, the trustees knew that their 
£490,000 CHAPS payment had failed. I accept that they did not know that the funds had 
been returned to Hs Coutts bank account, but they did know that the funds had not reached 
W.
At that point, the trustees had access to another £490,000 (or indeed £500,000) of Hs 
funds. I appreciate that those funds were earmarked for other purposes, but the trustees 
knew that the £490,000 CHAPS payment would be returned very soon  so, had they 
chosen to, they could have made another payment to ensure a total of £1 million reached W 
by the deadline. Like our investigator, I do not think it would be fair for me to hold Coutts 
responsible for any loss of interest suffered as a result.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint against Coutts & Company. I make no 
award.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask H to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2022.
