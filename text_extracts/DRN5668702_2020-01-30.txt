Mr A complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly 
lent to him. 
background
Between October 2017 and July 2018, Mr A took out 13 loans with Sunny. His borrowing 
history is as follows:

As set out above, there is an outstanding  balance on loans 8, 11 and 13. 
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be upheld in respect of loans 6 to 13. Sunny 
didnt agree with that view. It reiterated  the checks it had done in this case and that it 
appeared Mr A would be able to sustainably repay his loans. However, as a gesture of 
goodwill, it offered to write off the outstanding balance on loans 8, 11 and 13. 
Our adjudicator put Sunnys offer to Mr A. Through  his representatives, he said he agreed 
loans 6 to 13 should be upheld. However, he didnt accept the goodwill gesture offer off 
settlement. 
Both parties  have asked  for an ombudsman to look at the complaint. So the matter has been  
passed to me to make a final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr A could 
Ref: DRN56687022repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr A could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for this complaint.
As I said above, Mr A agreed with our adjudicators  view that the complaint should be upheld 
in respect of loans 6 to 13. So I havent  looked any further at loans 1 to 5. 
However, I have looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending  history with Mr A with a 
view to seeing if there was a point at which it should  reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. If that point  was reached,  Sunny should  
have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr As case, I agree with our adjudicator  that this point 
was reached at loan 6. At this stage,  Sunny ought to have realised Mr A was not managing 
to repay  his loans  sustainably.  He had taken out six loans  in less than six months. It should 
have been reasonably clear to Sunny that Mr A was most likely borrowing further to cover 
the hole repaying  his previous loan left in his finances. I think Sunny should have realised 
Ref: DRN56687023that Mr A was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in his income, but to meet an 
ongoing need. 
In October  2017, Mr A initially borrowed £400 and when he applied  for loan 13 nine months 
later, he borrowed £200.  It seems  to me that Mr A wasnt making any real inroads to the 
amount he owed Sunny. Mr A had paid a large amount of interest  to effectively service a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period. 
I think that Mr A lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans Mr A borrowed were likely to have  had negative  implications on 
his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-
cost loans.
So, Im upholding  the complaint loans 6 to 13 and Sunny must take action to put things right. 
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr A loans 6 to 13. 
As I said above, there is an outstanding  balance  on loans 8, 11 and 13. If Sunny has sold 
the outstanding debts,  it must buy them back if it is able to do so. If it is not able to buy the 
debts back, it must liaise with the new debt owner  to achieve the results outlined  below:
a)Sunny  must add together  the total of the repayments made by Mr A towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, 
not including  anything it was already refunded; 
b)It must  calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr A 
which were considered as part of paragraph  (a) calculated from the date Mr A 
originally made  the payments to the date the complaint is settled; 
c)Sunny  must remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any 
upheld outstanding loans. It must treat any repayments made by Mr A as though 
they had been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  
in Mr A having made overpayments, Sunny must refund those overpayments with 
8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments from the date they would 
have arisen to the date the complaint is settled. It must then calculate  the 
amounts calculated in paragraphs (a) and (b) and move  to paragraph (e). 
d)If there  is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts  calculated  in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) should be used to repay any balance remaining on the outstanding 
loans. If this results in a surplus, the surplus  should  be paid to Mr A. However, if 
there is still an outstanding balance, Sunny should try to agree an affordable  
repayment plan with Mr A. It must not pursue  an outstanding balance of principal 
it has already written off. 
e)The overall pattern  of Mr As borrowing for loans 6 to 13 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. Sunny should  remove these loans entirely from 
Mr As credit file. It does not have to remove loans 6 to 13 until they have been 
repaid, but it must still remove any adverse information recorded  about them.  
Ref: DRN56687024.*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. It should give 
Mr A a certificate  showing  how much tax youve deducted, if he asks for one. 
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Mr As complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited must  put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2020.
