The complaint
Miss T says Canada Square Operations Limited mis-sold her a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy. 
What happened
Miss T bought the policy in 2000 at the same time as taking out a credit card online. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Miss T disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding Mrs Ts case.
Ive decided not to uphold Miss Ts complaint for the following reasons.
Miss T ticked a box on her online application to indicate she wanted PPI. She did not tick the 
box to say she didnt want it. So, I think Canada Square made Miss T aware that she had a 
choice about buying the PPI, and that she chose to take it. Miss T says the information given 
to her at the time strongly encouraged her to take the PPI, but Im not persuaded that was 
the case. 
Canada Square recommended the PPI to Miss T, and it seems to have been right for her 
based on what Ive seen of her circumstances at the time. 
Its possible the information Canada Square gave Miss T about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Miss T doesnt appear to have been affected by any of the main things 
the policy didnt cover  and based on what I know about her circumstances it looks like the 
policy couldve been useful to her. So I dont think better information wouldve stopped her 
buying it. 
Ive taken into account Miss Ts comments. But these points dont change my conclusion.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Miss Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss T to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 May 2020.
