K821x#15complaint
Ms C says Ferratum UK Ltd irresponsibly lent to her.
background
This complaint is about 16 loans Ferratum provided  to Ms C between December 2014 and 
February 2017. Ms Cs borrowing history  is attached  to the end of this decision.
An adjudicator reviewed Ms Cs complaint and thought  loans 3-5 shouldnt have been given 
to Ms C as she had shown signs of struggling to repay some of her existing loans. And the 
adjudicator thought loans  6 -16 shouldnt  have been  given as Ms Cs pattern  of borrowing 
suggested Ms C had become persistently reliant  on short  term loans. 
Ferratum made an offer in response  to the adjudicators  opinion.  This included a refund of 
interest and charges paid on loans 10-16. This offer was outlined  to Ms C, but she rejected 
it. 
As no agreement could be reached  the case was referred to me  an ombudsman   for a 
final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Ferratum needed  to take reasonable steps to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms C 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Ferratum  should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN20843332I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Ferratum was required to establish
whether Ms C could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this
context and what this all means for Ms Cs complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think Ferratum needed  to more when it approved loans  1 and 2. Ms C 
didnt disagree  with this so I wont  be making further  findings on these loans, but I have 
considered them when looking at Ms Cs borrowing history and his financial situation overall.
The adjudicator explained that had Ferratum considered Ms Cs situation  carefully  and 
carried out proportionate checks for loan 3 it would have shown Ms C was not able to 
sustainably repay  further borrowing. I agree with this and Ill explain why.
When Ms C applied for loan 3 she had already taken  out two loans with Ferratum. Loan  1 
was deferred by 8 days and then for loan 2 Ms C agreed to a payment plan with Ferratum  to 
clear the balance over two instalments.  Loan  3 was taken out just over a month after loan 2 
and I think Ferratum shouldve seen from her previous  issues repaying her loans  that Ms C 
was not in a position  to take on further  borrowing without struggling.  So I dont think loans  3-
6 shouldve been given to Ms C as Ferratum shouldve seen that she would not have been 
able to repay these  loans  sustainably. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Ferratums lending history  with Ms C with a view to
seeing if there was a point at which Ferratum should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Ferratum should  have  realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Cs case, I think that this point  was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Ferratum  ought to have realised  Ms C was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Ms C had taken out 6 loans in just under 8 months. So Ferratum  
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Ms C was having to borrow further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving  in her finances and that 
Ms Cs indebtedness  was increasing  unsustainably.
Ms Cs first loan was for £300  and her subsequent loans varied  in amount 
considerably. But most  importantly there  didnt seem to be a downward  trend  in the 
amount Ms C was borrowing.  At this point  Ferratum ought to have known that Ms C 
was not likely borrowing  to meet a temporary  shortfall in her income  but to meet  an 
ongoing need.
Ref: DRN20843333Ms C wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Ferratum. Loan 6 was 
taken out around 8 months after Ms Cs first. And Ms Cs loans  were  often taken out 
within a few weeks of paying off her previous one. Ms C had paid large  amounts of 
interest to, in effect, service a debt to Ferratum over an extended period.
I think that Ms C lost out because Ferratum continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Cs indebtedness by allowing her
to take expensive credit intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Ms C borrowed was likely  to
have had negative  implications on Ms Cs ability to access mainstream credit  and so
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 3 to 16 and Ferratum should  put things 
right.
putting things right  what Ferratum UK Ltd needs to do
Ferratum UK Ltd shouldnt have given Ms C loans  3 to 16.
A)Ferratum UK Ltd should add together the total of the repayments  made  by Ms C 
towards interest, fees and charges on these loans, including  payments made to a 
third party  where  applicable,  but not including anything Ferratum UK Ltd has 
already refunded.
B)Ferratum UK Ltd should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual  payments 
made by Ms C which were considered  as part of A, calculated  from the date   
Ms C originally  made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C)Ferratum UK Ltd should pay Ms C the total of A plus B.
D)Ferratum UK Ltd should remove any adverse information it has recorded  on 
Ms Cs credit  file in relation to loan 3-5. The overall pattern of Ms Cs borrowing 
for loans 6-16 means any information  recorded  about them  is adverse, so 
Ferratum UK Ltd should remove these loans entirely  from Ms Cs credit  file. If 
Ferratum UK Ltd has sold any of the loans it should ask the debt purchaser to do 
the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  you to deduct tax from this interest.  Ferratum  UK Ltd should give 
Ms C a certificate showing  how much tax its deducted,  if they ask for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im upholding  Ms Cs complaint. Ferratum UK Ltd should pay 
put things right for Ms C as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman ask Ms C to accept  or reject my decision 
before 18 April 2020.
