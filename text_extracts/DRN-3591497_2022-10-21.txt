The complaint
Ms O complains that London Mutual Credit Union Limited (LMCU) irresponsibly granted 
her credit that she couldnt afford to repay. 
What happened
LMCU approved several loans, and payday loans, for Ms O between May 2013 and October 
2014. Ive summarised those loans in the following table.
Loan Date Amount Repayment Term
1 24/5/2013 £400 £142.37 3
2 24/7/2013 £400 £142.37 3
3 5/8/2013 £1,000 £95.00 12
4 29/8/2013 £400 £142.37 3
5 13/11/2013 £200 £73 3
6 10/12/2013 £1,000 £95.00 12
7 3/7/2014 £100 £114 1
8 20/8/2014 £100 £114 1
9 24/9/2014 £100 £39 3
10 9/10/2014 £1,000 £70 18
11 9/10/2014 Reschedule £1,332 £74 18
Ms O says that LMCU were wrong to provide credit as it wasnt affordable for her.
LMCU disagree. They say that when they approved the loans they reviewed Ms Os income 
and expenditure, checked her pay slips and bank statements, and performed a credit check. 
They explained that whilst they did reject some of Ms Os other applications they found the 
loans Ive listed above, affordable for her. 
Our investigator thought that LMCU shouldnt have approved some of the loans and she 
suggested LMCU should take some action to remedy the situation. But LMCU disagreed and 
the complaint has been referred to me, an ombudsman, for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to considering complaints about unaffordable and irresponsible lending is set 
out on our website. Ive had this approach in mind when considering whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
In LMCUs final response to Ms O they said that for the £1,000 loans they reviewed bank 
statements, checked pay slips, and completed a credit check before approving the lending. I 
think they were reasonable and proportionate checks. Ill therefore go on to consider if the 
information LMCU saw for these loans suggested they were affordable for Ms O.
The checks they did for the other loans havent been well evidenced and although these 
loans were smaller I think, given Ms Os history of needing short term lending, the business 
should have done more to assure themselves that the lending was affordable for Ms O. They 
should have considered Ms Os expenditure. I dont know what they would have discovered 
if theyd asked about that but in the absence of other information I think the best place to 
look is in Ms Os bank statements from around the time of lending. 
For loans 1, 2, and 3 Ive not been provided with evidence from Ms O to show the loans 
were unaffordable for her, Ive not seen bank statements covering that period and her credit 
file doesnt demonstrate its likely she was struggling financially. I think the credit LMCU 
provided was therefore likely to be affordable and the lending decisions were reasonable. As 
loan 6 was to refinanced loan 3 at the same rate of interest I dont think Ms O was 
disadvantaged by that or that loan 6 was unaffordable.
For loans 4 and 5 Ms Os bank statements show she was struggling to meet her essential 
costs and her debts to other lenders. She was borrowing from several pay day lenders 
(about eight) and her payments towards those debts, payments towards food and essential 
expenses, and payments to debt collection companies, were in excess of her income. I dont 
think the repayments on these loans could fairly be considered sustainably affordable and I 
dont think they should have been provided.
For loans 7 to 11 Ms Os bank statements show she was still heavily reliant on payday loans, 
shed also taken out two credit cards with credit limits totalling £750, she was paying back 
debts to at least four debt collectors and her outgoings on these debt repayments, and her 
essential spending, were in excess of her income which was still around £1,800 per month. I 
dont think these loans were therefore sustainably affordable for Ms O and I dont think they 
should have been advanced by LMCU.
Ive read LMCUs submissions and I understand their commendable purpose. I dont dispute 
that they help individuals, who would otherwise have to pay high interest rates for credit to 
obtain credit at much more favourable rates. However, I cant see that the money LMCU 
provided with regards to the loans Ive disputed, reduced Ms Os overall burden of debt. She 
continued to take out loans with payday lenders and unfortunately the lending simply 
increased her indebtedness.Putting things right
To put things right, I think LMCU should:
Refund any interest and charges already paid by Ms O in respect of loans 4 and
5, and 7 to 11. 
Apply 8% simple interest per year to any interest and charges refunded from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse payment information about the refunded loans from Ms Os 
credit file
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LMCU to take off tax from this interest. LMCU must give
Ms O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part and tell London Mutual Credit Union Limited to put things right 
in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms O to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2022.
