The complaint
Mr Y complains about the service provided by Madison CF UK Limited, trading as 118 118 
Money, which prevented the reinstatement of his loan and impacted on his credit file.
What happened
On 22 February 2022, Mr Y took out a Â£5000 loan with 118 118 Money. 
However, on 6 March 2022 Mr Y emailed 118 118 Money requesting to withdraw from the 
agreement. As Mr Y didnt receive a quick response to his email, he called 118 118 Money 
and spoke to a representative. 
On the call the 118 118 Money representative confirmed the withdrawal of the loan and Mr Y 
said he would repay the loan within the required timeframe and before 4 April 2022.
On the 1 April 2022 Mr Y changed his mind and sent an email to 118 118 Money informing 
them that he no longer wanted to withdraw from the loan agreement. As he didnt get a quick 
response he emailed again on 4 April 2022 and says he followed this up with calls. 
As Mr Y didnt get to speak to a 118 118 Money representative, he didnt repay the loan on 4 
April 2022. Instead, he called again on 8 April when 118 118 Money said the loan had 
already been cancelled and it wasnt possible for it to be reinstated.
As Mr Y didnt immediately repay the loan, a late payment was registered on his credit file.
Mr Y complained to 118 118 Money about being unable to get a response from 
representatives before the 4 April 2022, as he felt this prevented him from reinstating the 
loan agreement.   
Although 118 118 Money apologised for the difficulties Mr Y had in getting an immediate 
response, they said theyd made him aware that he couldnt reverse his withdrawal request 
prior to his email of 1 April 2022. They added that Mr Y was also made aware of the 
consequences and impact that may occur on his credit file if he didnt return the loan 
advance by the required 30-day timeframe.
Mr Y complained to our service, but our investigator didnt uphold his complaint.
As Mr Y remains dissatisfied this case has now been referred to me to look at.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, while I know this will come as a disappointment to Mr Y, I think the 
investigator has reached the right conclusion here. I dont think 118 118 Money has acted 
unfairly or unreasonably in its dealings with Mr Y and Ill explain why.
I first listened to Mr Ys call with 118 118 Money on 6 March 2022 when he made a request 
to withdraw from the agreement. I found that the representative was very clear that once she 
had processed Mr Ys request the loan couldnt be reversed. She reiterated that once the 
withdrawal was processed, Mr Y would no longer be a loan customer and it will be as though 
the loan never existed. 
In addition, Mr Y was informed of the consequences and impact that may occur on his credit 
file if he didnt return the loan advance by the required 30-day timeframe. Furthermore, the 
30-day timeframe is stated within the loan agreement and Mr Y said he would repay the loan 
by 4 April 2022.
Mr Y was aware that 118 118 Money email responses arent immediate, and I can see 
evidence of the calls he made prior to the 4 April 2022. However, the length of the calls were 
very short which indicates either a technical issue or abandonment. 
Although Mr Y didnt get to speak to 118 118 Money or a response to the email he sent prior 
to the date he agreed to repay the loan, 118 118 Money had already clearly informed him 
that the loan agreement had been withdrawn and couldnt be reinstated. So, regardless of 
Mr Ys communication attempts and 118 118 Moneys email response time, I dont think 
theres any doubt that Mr Ys reinstatement request wouldve been declined if there were 
communications prior to 4 April 2022. 
I think Mr Y shouldve reasonably been aware of this and, having both requested and agreed 
to the loan cancellation, this left him with no alternative other than to repay what he owed to 
118 118 Money by the deadline hed agreed to. So, the only option if he couldnt repay the 
outstanding amount of the loan, wouldve been for him to apply for a new loan  which is 
what he subsequently decided to do with another provider. 
Its unclear if Mr Y still possessed the funds to repay the loan and I think it more likely than 
not that he didnt. I say this because despite committing to fully repay 118 118 Money by 4 
April 2022 he didnt pay it until much later on 15 June 2022. Also, he hasnt submitted 
information to show he still possessed the funds and after 4 April 2022 he made enquiries 
about a repayment plan. 
So, considering all the above I havent seen anything which suggests 118 118 Money have 
acted unreasonably or unfairly here. They made it clear that once cancelled, the loan 
withdrawal couldnt be reversed, and Mr Y was aware of when the loan had to be repaid and 
the consequences of not doing so. In addition, 118 118 Money correctly fulfilled their 
obligation to report an accurate reflection of the account payments to credit reference 
agencies.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Y to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2023.
