The complaint
Mr G complains that The Royal London Mutual Insurance Society Limited (RL) caused 
delays to his pension transfer to another provider  provider A. 
RL has acknowledged it caused delays and has paid Mr G redress following a loss 
calculation produced by provider A. It has also offered Mr G £200 compensation for the 
inconvenience and distress caused. Mr G doesnt consider that this offer is suitable under 
the circumstances. 
What happened
Mr G said he signed and returned transfer documents to RL on 8 July 2021 so that his 
pension could be transferred to provider A. He said that RL received provider As request for 
the transfer on 20 July 2021 through the Origo transfer system. Provider A requested 
updates about the transfer on 6 and 20 August 2021. 
On 23 August 2021, RL said the Origo system noted that the client address was different, so 
it contacted Mr Gs IFA. But he said that RL didnt have a different client address. On 24 
August 2021, RL marked the pension as transferred. And arranged for £259,228.36 to be 
paid to provider A. Mr G said that although RL closed his pension on 24 August 2021, 
provider A didnt receive the funds until 1 September 2021.
Mr G said he had expected the transfer to take a couple of days. So he felt it shouldve 
completed on 24 July 2021. He said he monitored the values of his pension online. And that 
it was still active and worth £264,525 on 24 August 2021. Mr G said that his pension with RL 
wasnt active on 25 August 2021.
Mr Gs Independent Financial Adviser (IFA) wrote to RL about the issue on 23 September 
2021. He felt that RL had caused delays to the transfer.
RL acknowledged that transfers were taking longer than usual. But said that itd followed its 
standard procedure when itd backdated the transfer to the original activation date of the 
transfer request. RL said this was to ensure its customers got the unit price as at the day it 
received the initial transfer out request.
Mr Gs IFA then raised a formal complaint on 1 October 2021. 
RL reviewed the complaint. It confirmed that the correct value had been paid and used. It 
said that the transfer request had come in on 20 July 2021 and that the quote date it had 
used was the same date. Therefore the correct value was £259,228.36. It also confirmed 
that this was in line with the terms and conditions for the transferred plan.  
But RL acknowledged that due to high volumes of work, the transfer process hadnt been 
done in a reasonable time. It said it wouldve ideally completed the transfer within ten 
working days. As such, it said it would cover any investment loss that Mr G had suffered. 
And asked for a loss calculation showing what the fund would be worth now if it had issued 
the £259,228.36 by direct credit on 2 August 2021, rather than 24 August 2021. 
On 15 November 2021, Mr Gs IFA sent RL the redress calculation provider A had carried 
out. This had been calculated as if the transfer had completed on 2 August 2021. This 
showed that Mr G had incurred an investment loss of £3,719.12.
RL issued its final response to the complaint on 17 November 2021. It upheld Mr Gs 
complaint. And acknowledged itd caused avoidable delays to the transfer. It offered Mr G 
£200 compensation for the distress and inconvenience it had caused. And agreed to pay the 
financial redress provider A had calculated. 
Mr G agreed to proceed with the payment of £3,719.12 to provider A. But he didnt accept 
the £200 compensation offered. He still felt that his complaint hadnt been dealt with 
satisfactorily. 
Mr Gs IFA chased RL at the end of November 2021 as the redress payment hadnt arrived 
at provider A. 
RL said that due to Anti-Money Laundering Regulations, payments were taking longer than 
usual. But said that the money should be with provider A in the next couple of days.
Mr Gs IFA emailed RL again on 1 December 2021 as provider A still hadnt received the 
payment of £3,719.12. He asked it to check the payment had gone.
RL emailed Mr Gs IFA on 3 December 2021. It apologised that hed had to chase the 
payment. And told him that itd been advised on 1 December 2021 that provider A had 
rejected the direct credit itd sent, but hadnt told it why. RL said it had sent an email the 
same day for the payment to be made by Telegraphic Transfer (TT). So it said the payment 
should get to provider A the following day. 
RL said it had calculated - using this services benchmark  the further investment loss on 
the redress amount from 19 November 2021, when Mr G had accepted the redress, to 1 
December 2021. And this had led to a figure of £275.08. It offered to pay this to Mr G directly 
or to transfer it to provider A. It also offered to let provider A carry out a loss calculation from 
19 November 2021 to 1 December 2021 instead.
Mr G asked RL to send the additional £275.08 payment direct to provider A. Mr Gs IFA said 
that this payment arrived at provider A on 7 December 2021.
Mr G wasnt happy with RLs overall offer. So he brought his complaint to this service. He felt 
hed lost more money that the £3,719.12 calculated. He wanted RL to compensate him in full 
for his financial losses, which he felt totalled over £6,000. He also wanted more than £200 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience.
Our investigator didnt consider that the complaint should be upheld. He felt that RLs 
resolution to the complaint was fair. 
Mr G didnt agree with our investigator. He felt that RL had gained financially by using his 
pension monies to trade outside the agreed terms.
As agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has come to me for a review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Having done so, Im not going to uphold it. I know my decision will be very disappointing to 
Mr G. But Im satisfied that although RL did caused delays to the transfer, it has taken 
reasonable steps to put things right. Ill explain why.
Its not in dispute that RL caused avoidable delays to Mr Gs transfer. RL has acknowledged 
that it shouldve completed the transfer on 2 August 2021  ten working days after the 
necessary Origo transfer request was received - instead of 24 August 21. 
As our investigator noted, taking ten working days to complete a transfer is within RLs 
service level agreement. And is also in line with industry standards. So Im satisfied that the 
transfer shouldve been completed by 2 August 2021.
For things to have been fairly put right, this service considers that any redress should put Mr 
G back to the position he wouldve been in if there hadnt been a delay. So I need to 
consider if RLs offer does this. 
The policy terms and conditions state, under Section 7.2 and 7.3:
Your transfer date will be the business day on which we receive the last of your written 
instructions and any other documentation and information that we require or, if later, a date 
that you specify.
We will calculate the amount available to transfer at your transfer date. This amount will be 
equal to the value of the units held by your Core Investments as at that date, calculated 
according to section 7.3:
7.3 Value of the units held by your Core Investments
In each unit-linked fund the value of the units will be the number of units held by your Core 
Investments in that fund on your transfer date multiplied by the unit price of that fund. 
So the amount RL shouldve transferred would be the amount reflected on Mr Gs account 
when it received the Origo transfer request on 20 July 2021. This was £259,228.36. 
This amount shouldve been transferred no later than 2 August 2021. But it wasnt 
transferred until 24 August 2021. So provider A calculated what Mr Gs investments wouldve 
grown by between 2 August 2021 and 24 August 2021. 
I consider that this was the correct period to look at. I say this even though I acknowledge 
that the transfer monies werent invested with provider A until 1 September 2021. This is 
because I consider that the completion process wouldve taken the same amount of time if 
RL had transferred the monies on 2 August 2021.
Provider A calculated that Mr Gs funds wouldve grown by £3,719.12 over the period from 2 
August 2021 to 24 August 2021. RL has transferred £259,228.36 and £3,719.12 to provider 
A. Im satisfied that in doing so, it has ensured that Mr G has been put back into the position 
he wouldve been in if the delay hadnt occurred.
I can see that provider A rejected the £3,719.12 payment RL sent, but didnt tell it why. RL 
re-sent the payment by TT so that it would get to provider A as quickly as possible. And also 
calculated the further investment loss on the redress amount from 19 November 2021, when 
Mr G had accepted the redress, to 1 December 2021. 
Overall, Im satisfied that Mr G has been put back into the position he wouldve been in but 
for the delays caused by RL.I acknowledge that Mr G doesnt agree. He considers that RL has gained financially from the 
delays it caused. He said this because he was monitoring the value of his funds while they 
were still with RL. And he noticed that they were worth £264,525 on 24 August 2021. 
While I understand why Mr G feels this way, I satisfied that RL didnt act incorrectly here. As 
I explained earlier, the 20 July 2021 valuation date was established by the terms and 
conditions, which RL correctly followed. And which Mr G agreed to when he took out his 
pension with RL.
I also consider that the terms and conditions were clear about how the transfer value would 
be calculated. If Mr Gs transfer had been processed during a period of market decline, 
these same terms and conditions wouldve protected him from a decrease in value. Without 
the benefit of hindsight, its impossible to know whether the terms and conditions will be 
beneficial to a customer or not. But I dont consider them to be unfair. 
If there had been no delay, RL wouldve transferred £259,228.36 to provider A on 2 August 
2021. And this wouldve been worth an additional £3,719.12 on 24 August 2021. Im satisfied 
that this is the position Mr G is now in. 
Distress and inconvenience 
Mr G was clearly actively involved in his pension transfer and reasonably expected it to take 
place more quickly. I can see that it wouldve been distressing to see the transfer to take 
longer than it should have. This is especially the case in what we now know was a rising 
market at the time. 
However, I can also see that RL responded reasonably, and in what I consider a timely 
manner, to Mr Gs complaint. It apologised for the delays. And arranged for a third party to 
carry out the financial redress calculations, which it then followed. Its also offered to pay Mr 
G £200 for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
I acknowledge that there were further issues with the payment of the calculated financial 
redress. But Ive seen no evidence that RL was responsible for these delays. And in any 
event, as our investigator noted, this service is unable to investigate complaint handling.
Overall, I consider that RLs offer of £200 for the distress and inconvenience it caused Mr G 
was reasonable under the circumstances. 
From what Ive seen, RL has taken reasonable steps to put things right. Therefore I dont 
require them to take any further steps. And I dont uphold the complaint. 
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint for the reasons above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 January 2023.
