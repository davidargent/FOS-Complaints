K821x#15Complaint
Miss K has complained  about  the loans she took out with Elevate Credit  International Limited  
trading as Sunny. Miss K says Sunny failed to identify that she had become dependent  on 
payday loans  and had become stuck in a cycle of borrowing to repay previous loans. 
Background
Miss K took out a running credit facility along with 26 instalment loans from Sunny between 
June 2014 and April 2017. A summary of Miss Ks borrowing, based on the information 
provided to us from Sunny, can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
In our latest  assessment the adjudicator  didnt  think  Sunny made an error when it provided 
Miss Ks running credit facility (loan  1) as well as instalment loans 2 - 6. 
But by loan 7 the adjudicator felt Sunny shouldve been carrying out more detailed  checks  
which ought to have included verifying the information Miss K had provided about  her 
circumstances. And had Sunny carried out this level of check it wouldve realised  Miss K 
wouldnt be able to afford this or later loans because  shed been a regular user of short  term 
loans from other lenders,  had a personal loan and a number of credit card commitments  
which together took up a significant portion of Miss Ks income.
And by loan 11, our adjudicator thought  that Miss Ks pattern of lending  shouldve showed  
Sunny that these  loans were no longer sustainable  for her.
Sunny didnt respond to the most recent assessment, but it had previously told us that it 
didnt think it had made an error when providing loans 1  14. It said these loans  appeared 
affordable to it based on the checks that it carried out and Miss K was committed to 
spending a small  percentage of her declared income  to meet her repayments. But it 
reiterated that its previous offer to uphold all loans from 15 was still available.  
 Miss K appears to have accepted the adjudicators findings.  As no agreement  could be 
reached, the case has been passed  to me for a final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   Weve set out our general approach  to
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good
industry practice - on our website.
To start, Miss K appears to have accepted our adjudicators  most  recent  findings.  This 
means I no longer  think loans 1  6 are in dispute so I will not make a finding  on these loans 
in this decision. But I have kept these loans in mind  when  thinking about Miss Ks overall 
lending pattern with Sunny. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this meant  that it should have carried out proportionate checks in order  to reasonably 
conclude whether Miss K could repay the loans  in a sustainable manner.
Ref: DRN92021802These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this 
in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. Certain factors  might  
point to the fact that Sunny should  fairly and reasonably have done more  to establish that 
any lending  was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  include, but are not limited  to:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ks complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check from loan 7 would most likely have 
shown that;
Miss K was committed  to spending over 45% of her declared income to Sunny and 
another payday lender. On top of this Miss K also had a personal  loan and number of 
other credit cards that needed to be serviced.  
In these circumstances, there  was a significant risk that Miss K wouldnt have been  
able to repay loan 7 or any further  loans without undue difficulty or without  needing to 
borrow further. I dont  think  that Sunny could reasonably have believed that Miss K 
would be able to make the payments  over the term of the agreement bearing  in mind 
this loan was taken out on the same day that loan 6 was repaid.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss K, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful.
Our adjudicator thought Sunny shouldve seen this by the time Miss K applied  for loan 11. I 
have considered our adjudicators points, and Im minded to agree.  I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss K was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss K had taken out 10 loans  within 6 months in this chain  of 
lending and Miss K had been  indebted to Sunny for the whole  time.  So Sunny ought  
to have realised it was more likely than not Miss K was having to borrow  further to 
Ref: DRN92021803cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that 
Miss Ks indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
From  loan 11 onwards  Miss K would  frequently take out new loans within  days of 
settling previous ones.
Miss K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan 27 was 
taken out 2 years after Miss Ks first instalment loan.  And although her final loan was 
slightly smaller  there was no significant  decreasing pattern in the lending.  So Miss K 
had paid large amounts of interest  to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
I think that Miss K lost out when  Sunny  provided  loan 11 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ks indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period of time and;
the sheer number  of loans would more likely than not have had negative  implications 
on Miss Ks ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept her in the market  for 
these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  Miss Ks complaint about  loans 7  27 and. Sunny should put things right 
as detailed below.
putting things right  what I currently  think Sunny  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss K paid on loans 7 - 27
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  from Miss Ks credit file about  loans 7- 10
the number  of loans taken from 11 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  loans  11-27  should  be removed from Miss Ks 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Miss K a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN92021804My final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ks complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  pay Miss K compensation as set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 3 May 2020.
