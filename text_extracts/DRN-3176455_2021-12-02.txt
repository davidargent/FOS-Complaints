The complaint
Mr J complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (Aqua) lent to him irresponsibly.  
What happened
Mr J applied for an Aqua credit card in March 2014 and it was agreed with a limit of £250. 
Limit increases were offered by Aqua and put in place as follows: 
Date Limit
March 2014  new card £250
July 2014 £400
January 2015 £500
October 2015 £1,000
April 2016 £1,750
August 2016 £2,500
February 2017 £3,250
August 2020 (Mr Js 
request)£3,450
Mr J complained. He said Aqua didnt complete sufficient checks when offering the 
increased limits. He had a lot of other debts, including payday loans. He was now in a spiral 
of debt and had taken other loans to try to make the payments. His credit file had been badly 
affected. He was suffering a lot of stress.
Aqua said that Mr J had passed their credit checks at each stage. When he applied for the 
card, he said he was earning £15,000 a year and had other debts of only £400. Aqua 
couldnt see any signs of problems  there werent any defaults, payday loans or arrears. 
When they assessed the increases, theyd looked at how Mr J had used the card and were 
satisfied the increases were justified. Mr J couldve opted out of the increases that they 
offered but didnt.
Mr J brought his complaint to us. We saw that the limit increases up to and including January 
2015 were more than six years before Mr J complained to Aqua  so under our rules, we 
couldnt look at those. Our investigator advised Mr J of this. He went on to uphold Mr Js 
complaint in respect of the limit increases from October 2015 onwards. This was because he 
could see that Mr J was borrowing up to his limit and making only minimum payments each 
month. There was also a pattern of missed payments. He didnt believe that the other debts 
of £64 in October 2015 - which Aqua could see in their searches - could be accurate. He 
said that Aqua should refund interest and fees charged as a result of the increases since 
October 2015 - and add 8% simple interest to this. Mr Js credit file should be amended to 
remove any adverse data for the same period. If the debt had been sold to a debt collection 
agency, Aqua should take it back onto their books and agree a repayment schedule with Mr 
J.
Aqua didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at Mr Js complaint.
I reached a provisional decision where I said:
I take a different view to our investigator. I think the increases up to and including April 2016
(to £1,750) were OK, but those after that were not. I will explain.
All lenders have an obligation to lend money responsibly. We must check whether Aqua 
acted in line within the Financial Conducts (FCA) rules on creditworthiness assessment 
as set out in its handbook, (CONC) section 5.2. These say that a firm must undertake a 
reasonable assessment of creditworthiness, considering both the risk to it of the customer 
not making the repayments, as well as the risk to the customer of not being able to make 
repayments. We look at:
Whether the lender completed reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy 
itself that the borrower would be able to repay any credit in a sustainable way?
If reasonable and proportionate checks were completed, did the lender make a 
fair lending decision made bearing in mind the information gathered and what the 
lender knew about the borrowers circumstances?
And a reasonable and proportionate check would usually need to be more thorough:
othe lower a customers income, and the higher amount to be repaid.
othe greater the number of loans and frequency of loans.
othe longer the term of the loans
Its important to note that the checks must be proportionate to the amount being lent  so 
the higher the amount, the greater the checks must be, and the lower the amount, then 
fewer checks can be made.
So, I have looked at the increases in the light of this guidance.
When Mr J applied for the card, he told Aqua he was earning £15,000 a year, and was a
tenant. He had other debts of £400. Aqua still had that information when they looked at the
increases later. We can only look at the increases from October 2015  because we can 
only look at events which took place within six years of Mr Js complaint - in April 2021. So 
 we cant look at what happened before April 2015.
Looking at the first increase from £500 to £1,000 in October 2015. Mr J was borrowing up 
to the previous limit. And had gone over his limit three times in the last year. Hed also 
missed two payments. But other than that, things were OK  and Aqua could see that he 
only had £64 of other debts, with no payday loans. I consider the limit of £1,000 to be 
modest, and therefore I think Aqua were OK to offer Mr J a new limit of that amount.
Looking at the next increase to £1,750 in April 2016. Again, things looked OK  on 
balance. Mr Js borrowing had been well within his old limit. No payments had been missed. Aqua could now see that Mr J had other debts of £1,324  this had increased but 
was still OK. There were four payday loans showing  but again, on balance, I think Aqua 
were OK to offer the increase to Mr J.
But by the next increase, in August 2016  to £2,500  there is evidence to say that Aqua 
shouldve made more inquiries into Mr Js circumstances. By then, they could see Mr J 
had used the card for cash withdrawal six times  a sign of problems. The borrowing was 
continually up to the limit. There were three payday loans showing  and Mr J had other 
debts which had increased to £2,662. One payment has been missed. And  the increase 
was only four months since the last one.
These trends continued when the increase to £3,250 was offered in February 2017. There 
had been three cash withdrawals. Borrowing was up to the limit continually. A payment 
had been missed. There were three payday loans. And - Mr Js other debts had gone up 
to £4,385 from £2,662. And  the limit increase was only six months after the last one.
Looking at the last increase in August 2020  to £3,450. Mr J asked for this one. His 
borrowing had been up to the limit a lot - and over the limit on three occasions. There had 
been 12 missed payments. Its not clear what Mr Js other debts were at the time of this 
increase  as Aquas data doesnt show it. But I can see that in July 2018  Mr Js debts 
were £10,772, with 15 payday loans in operation. This was a big change from the previous 
figures they saw. By the month after the increase  in September 2020  Mr Js debts had 
gone up to £44,380  so by then, he was in significant debt. I think its safe to assume that 
when Aqua looked at the increase in August 2020, Mr Js debts wouldve been of a similar 
figure.
And so  I think that up to and including the increase to £1,750 in April 2016, Aqua did 
complete enough, proportionate checks. But for the subsequent increases from August 
2016, I think theres evidence to say that Aqua shouldve made more inquiries into Mr Js 
circumstances before offering or agreeing to the increases.
Turning to the remedies. I could see that for all the increases up to February 2017  Mr J 
couldve opted out of Aquas offers but didnt. So, he must take some responsibility for what 
happened. Mr J has had the use of the money, so its not fair to ask Aqua to write off the 
debt. But I do think its fair that they refund all interest and fees charged from August 2016 
for borrowing over £1,750. If this clears the outstanding balance, then the resulting credit 
balance should attract interest at 8% simple from the date of overpayment to the date of 
settlement. Aqua should also remove any adverse information advised to credit reference 
agencies for the period from August 2016. Its not clear if Mr Js debt has been passed to a 
debt collection agency. But  if there is an outstanding debt, Aqua should agree a mutually 
agreeable payment schedule for it to be repaid  whether the debt is with a debt collection 
agency or on Aquas books.]
Responses to the provisional decision:
Mr J didnt have any comments, but Aqua did. They said, in summary:
The incidence of missed payments and cash withdrawals in the lead up to the limit 
increases in August 2016, February 2017 and August 2020 were less than I had 
quoted, and they didnt charge for the 12 missed payments between February 2017 
and August 2020.
They questioned the date and amount of interest to be refunded in the remedy I 
proposed. So  I now need to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I accept that I overstated the number of times that payments were missed, and cash 
withdrawals made in the periods up to August 2016 and February 2017 as Aqua have said. 
But, taken in the round, I still think that Aqua shouldve done more checks for the increases 
agreed in August 2016 and thereafter, particularly when seen in the light of Mr Js rising 
debts shown in Aquas searches. And, even though Aqua said they didnt charge for the 12 
missed payments up August 2020, there were still that number of missed payments - which 
is the important thing.
Looking at the proposed interest refund  I said that I thought the increase to £1,750 in April 
2016 was reasonable, but the increase to £2,500 in August 2016 wasnt. So  it seems fair 
to ask Aqua to refund the interest for any borrowing over £1,750 with effect from August 
2016  this date being the time when I considered that Aqua shouldve looked into Mr Js 
circumstances more closely.
And so  having considered Aquas comments, my final decision remains the same as I set 
out in the provisional decision.
My final decision
My final decision is to uphold this complaint. And NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua must:
Refund interest and fees on borrowing over £1,750 from August 2016 to the date of 
final decision.
If the balance is repaid by the refunds, pay 8% per annum simple on the amount 
overpaid from the date of overpayment to the date of settlement.
Remove any adverse information reported to credit reference agencies since August 
2016.
Agree a mutually agreeable repayment schedule with Mr J for any remaining 
borrowing.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2021.
