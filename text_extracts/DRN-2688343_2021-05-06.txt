The complaint
Mr S complains about how PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA dealt with a complaint under its 
Buyer Protection Scheme.
What happened
Mr S bought items via a business I will call E for just under Â£80. He says the items were 
delivered to the collection point, but he could see the box size was too small for the items he 
bought and so didnt take delivery of it. Mr S says he was told by the business that received 
the item which I will call A that the return address appeared to be a charity shop and says 
the seller was acting fraudulently. In summary Mr S would like compensation and the money 
refunded and says he told PayPal what had taken place and it ought to be able to confirm 
the return address.
PayPal says Mr S was not entitled to a refund under its Buyer Protection Scheme as Mr S 
didnt provide it with further information or evidence of the item being returned. It says its not 
responsible for the actions of E and A and the evidence it has, shows the return address to 
be correct. PayPal says Mr S raised the complaint as item significantly not as described 
and not as item not received and that is why it asked for evidence of return.
Mr S brought his complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator thought PayPal was entitled to close the complaint as it didnt have evidence of 
the item being returned.
Mr S doesnt accept that view and says he couldnt return something he didnt have and says 
its the couriers role to return the item. He says the seller is fraudulent.
I asked both sides for further information and PayPal says A would not have access to its 
systems and so couldnt comment on the address of the seller and says it closed the 
complaint in 2019 when Mr S didnt provide further information. Mr S says he asked PayPal 
for an update in November 2019 and says PayPal initially said the transaction was not 
processed by it and didnt ask for evidence.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint for the 
reasons I will explain. I appreciate how strongly Mr S feels about this complaint and that he 
will be disappointed by my decision. 
The Buyer Protection Scheme is run by PayPal and it is entitled to make a final decision 
about a dispute. I have looked at the information provided by both sides to decide if PayPal 
has acted fairly by concluding Mr S wasnt entitled to a refund. I also make clear to Mr S that 
E and PayPal are separate entities and I cant fairly comment on the actions of E or A.
Im satisfied that items were delivered to A for Mr S to pick up. I appreciate Mr S says he 
realised the items couldnt have been the ones he bought as the box was too small and that 
he didnt take actual possession of those items. I accept that Mr S directed A to return the 
item back to the seller. I have not seen any evidence the return address was a charity shop 
and not the address of the seller. And can see that PayPal says its checked the position and 
its satisfied the address was correct. I dont need to make a finding about the address, and I 
accept that its unlikely A would have had access to the sellers address.
I have looked at the information Mr S gave to PayPal and am satisfied this was a dispute 
raised by him as item received significantly not as described. I think that led PayPal to ask 
for evidence of Mr S returning the item which he couldnt provide. I accept Mr S couldnt 
provide that evidence as he hadnt come into possession of the item. But I dont think PayPal 
could have known that based on the complaint Mr S raised. I think that if Mr S had raised the 
complaint as item not received then that would have been the correct dispute and may 
have meant PayPal questioned the address and return.
I have looked carefully at the Buyer Protection Scheme and am satisfied that PayPal is 
entitled to refuse a claim where a customer doesnt respond to a request for information. I 
accept there may have been a breakdown in communication here and Mr S may have 
thought by raising issues with E that PayPal would be aware of them. But overall, Im 
satisfied that Mr S wasnt clear about what the dispute was about and raised the complaint 
about the item being not as described rather than not received. And that PayPal was 
reasonably entitled under its agreement to reject Mr Ss claim when it concluded that Mr S 
hadnt provided requested information.
I appreciate Mr S says that PayPals systems dont allow him to retain correspondence after 
three months. But Im satisfied on balance and based on the evidence I have seen, that 
PayPal was entitled to conclude it hadnt received the required information. For those 
reasons I cant fairly order PayPal to refund the payment or pay Mr S the compensation he 
would like.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 June 2021.
