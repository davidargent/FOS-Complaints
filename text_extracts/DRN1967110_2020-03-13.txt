Ms W has said Sunny did not lend to her responsibly and provided  her unaffordable lending.  
Sunny has said it completed  eligibility, creditworthiness  and affordability  checks for each 
loan application.  
Our adjudicator upheld  Ms Ws complaint in part and thought  loans 6 to 34 should  not have 
been given. Sunny didnt  agree in full. As there  is an outstanding balance  from loans 32 to 
34, Sunny  offered to write off the outstanding balance and remove loans 32 to 34 from       
Ms Ws credit file. Ms W did not accept  this offer. The complaint has now been  passed to me 
to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN19671102the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms W could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ws complaint.
Ms W hasnt  disagreed with our adjudicators opinion  on loans 1 to 5 so I wont be looking at 
these any further  as there is no ongoing  disagreement about  them.  But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Ms Ws other lending. 
Having looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Ms W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Ws case,  I think that this point was reached  by 
loan 6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Ms W was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably and was taking out loans in quick succession. Ms Ws overall  
pattern of borrowing suggested  that she had become  persistently  reliant  on short-
term loans. Ms W had taken out six loans  within five months and whilst the amounts 
fluctuated, they didnt  significantly  decrease  over this period and for the rest of the 
borrowing relationship  with Sunny. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more  
likely than not Ms W was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her 
Ref: DRN19671103previous loan was leaving  in her finances  and that Ms Ws indebtedness  was 
increasing unsustainably.
From  loan 6 onwards  Ms W was provided with a new loan within days of settling a 
previous one, and sometimes  when she was still paying for a previous loan.
Ms W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan  34 taken 
out 18 months after Ms Ws first. And it was for a larger amount. Ms W had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period.
I think that Ms W lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing  from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ws indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Ms W borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Ms Ws ability to access  mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 34 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms W paid on loans  6 to 34;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 34 should be removed from   
Ms Ws credit file.
If Ms W still owes Sunny any of the principal balance she borrowed on loans 32 to 34,
Sunny should  remove all the interest  and charges applied to the outstanding balance.
Sunny should  then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Ms W went  to towards
the principal. But importantly, Sunny needs  to make sure that Ms W doesnt repay more
than the principal amount borrowed.
If after doing this Ms W hasnt repaid the principal  she borrowed Sunny can deduct  this
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Ms W has already paid enough  to repay  the
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to her with 8% simple interest from the
date of payment  to the date of settlement.
And if Sunny no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Ms W.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Ms W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN19671104my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 April 2020.
