The complaint
Mr H complains about investment advice he received from Bank House Consultants Ltd. He 
thinks the advice was unsuitable for his circumstances as it didnt match his attitude to risk.
What happened
Mr H was an advisory client of BH. In May 2020 their advisor recommended that he sell the 
underlying holdings in his ISA and SIPP portfolios and move the funds to gold and cash due 
to the volatile economic climate at the time. Mr H accepted their recommendation, and the 
changes were made to his portfolios. 
Mr H complained to BH in 2021 about the advice he received. He said, in summary, that the 
recommendation wasnt explained adequately and was generic, rather than tailored to his 
circumstances. 
BH looked into his concerns but didnt uphold his complaint. They thought that at the time, 
global markets were volatile and there was no absolute certainty as to when stability would 
return. With this in mind, theyd proposed that Mr H should alter his portfolio structure and 
concentrate on gold and cash as defensive holdings. They noted that Mr H had accepted 
their proposal and his actions at the time, including evidencing his research into the gold 
market, showed that he had a good understanding of the gold market and its potential risks. 
Mr H didnt accept their findings and asked us to help. He thought that BH had made a 
blanket recommendation to all their clients, and it didnt fit his speculative risk profile. He also 
highlighted areas where hed received poor service from BH including: 
Investing £50,000 across his portfolio when hed told them to keep the funds as cash.
Investing £60,000 in a US Dollar fund despite not discussing or explaining the 
investment with him. 
Not investing in a renewable energy fund after hed had a discussion with them about 
the investment and agreed to it.
The complaint was considered by one of our investigators who didnt uphold it. He didnt 
think BH invested without Mr Hs knowledge or consent. He wasnt of the opinion that just 
because BH sent the same advice to other customers automatically meant it was unsuitable 
for Mr H. He thought that BHs adviser had informed Mr H that he felt moving to safer 
investments would protect Mr Hs funds. And given the effects of the pandemic and the 
volatility seen at the time, this wasnt unsuitable. 
The investigator didnt think there was any evidence to suggest that BH had provided Mr H 
with poor service. He noted that BH had provided emails which showed that Mr H had 
agreed to and thanked them for the £50,000 investment in February 2020. And theyd also 
provided evidence from September 2020 to show theyd advised Mr H to invest in an energy 
fund but hadnt received a response. 
Mr H didnt agree with the investigators findings. He thought that his individual objectives 
and requirements hadnt been considered, he hadnt received tailored advice and at no point 
were the consequences of the strategy explained. He also provided an email BHs adviser 
had sent him in February 2021 asking him why hed complained despite the adviser 
agreeing to pay him £10,000. 
The investigator wasnt persuaded to change his opinion so the complaint was passed to me 
to decide. I recently issued a provisional decision where I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Having done so, I think this complaint should be upheld and I will now explain why. Ive firstly 
considered the nature of Mr Hs relationship with BH. From what Ive seen there was a 
long-standing advisory relationship between both parties. Mr H was invested in BHs model 
portfolio 8 which was classed as speculative. In 2019 his asset split was as follows - 40% UK 
equities, 30% global equities, 10% gold, 9% multi-asset, 6% property, 4% absolute return, 
1% cash. I think that this shows that Mr H was willing to take a significant degree of risk with 
his ISA and SIPP. 
BH have said that the advice they gave Mr H in 2020 to move into low-risk holdings was 
because of the uncertainty that global markets were experiencing at the time. Theyve said 
that they had a discussion with Mr H prior to his acceptance of the proposal and think that 
his email response confirming his acceptance where he said - Great proactive work!!! - 
shows that he had sufficient understanding of their recommendation. 
BH had a responsibility to ensure that any advice they gave Mr H was suitable for his 
circumstances and objectives. I think that because of the existing relationship it wasnt 
unreasonable for Mr H to expect that any advice BH gave to him was suitable. It also doesnt 
seem unreasonable that he would have followed any advice he was given, especially at a 
time of significant market volatility. 
But I havent seen that BH reviewed his circumstances or sought any information from him 
prior to making the recommendation. The very nature of a speculative attitude to risk (ATR) 
means that an investor is prepared to take a significant risk of fluctuations in the value of 
their investment in order to try and achieve higher returns. I think a recommendation to move 
his entire holdings into gold and cash, even taking into account the volatility in the markets, 
was contrary to his objectives and ATR. 
The advice didnt mention any of the risks associated with moving into gold and cash at that 
point. There was nothing in BHs emails about the disadvantage of crystallising any losses 
already incurred by leaving the market, missing out on any potential upturn or a plan to 
return to the markets. Therefore, I think the advice wasnt balanced and it isnt surprising that 
Mr H accepted the recommendation.
I think that if BH had properly considered Mr Hs circumstances and fully explained the 
implications of their recommendation then its more likely than not that he would have 
chosen to keep his investments as they were. I say this because of his speculative ATR and 
how hed chosen to structure his holdings since hed been receiving advice from BH. From 
what Ive seen he had always been prepared to accept fluctuations in value and maintained 
a fairly high equity content in his portfolio, even during previous periods of volatility. 
Ive also considered the other points Mr H has raised about the poor service hes received. I 
havent seen any evidence to show that BH invested £50,000 when hed told them not to or 
that they invested £60,000 in a US Dollar fund without explaining their rationale to him. But I think that the content of BHs email from February 2021 implies that theyve done something 
wrong as they had offered to pay Mr H £10,000. But because I think that Mr Hs portfolio 
should have remained as it was prior to the advice to move into cash and gold, I think the 
fairest way to put things right would be for BH to calculate if Mr H has lost out as a result of 
their advice as set out below.
Fair compensation
In assessing what would be fair compensation, I consider that my aim should be to put Mr H 
as close to the position he would probably now be in if he had not been given unsuitable 
advice. 
I take the view that Mr H would have remained with the previous investments he held prior to 
the switch to cash and gold holdings in May 2020. Im satisfied that what Ive set out below is 
fair and reasonable in this situation. 
What must BH do?
To compensate Mr H fairly, BH must: 
Compare the performance of Mr H's investments with the notional value if he had 
remained with the previous investments. If the actual value is greater than the 
notional value, no compensation is payable. If the notional value is greater than the 
actual value, there is a loss and compensation of the difference between the notional 
and actual values is payable. 
BH should also add any interest set out below to the compensation payable. 
If there is a loss on his SIPP portfolio, BH should pay into Mr H's pension plan to 
increase its value by the amount of the compensation and any interest. The amount 
paid should allow for the effect of charges and any available tax relief. Compensation 
should not be paid into the pension plan if it would conflict with any existing 
protection or allowance. 
If BH is unable to pay the compensation into Mr H's pension plan, it should pay that 
amount direct to him. But had it been possible to pay into the plan, it would have 
provided a taxable income. Therefore the compensation should be reduced to 
notionally allow for any income tax that would otherwise have been paid. This is an 
adjustment to ensure the compensation is a fair amount  it isnt a payment of tax to 
HMRC, so Mr H wont be able to reclaim any of the reduction after compensation is 
paid. 
The notional allowance should be calculated using Mr H's actual or expected 
marginal rate of tax at his selected retirement age. 
Its reasonable to assume that Mr H is likely to be a higher rate taxpayer at the 
selected retirement age, so the reduction would equal 40%. However, if Mr H would 
have been able to take a tax free lump sum, the reduction should be applied to 75% 
of the compensation, resulting in an overall reduction of 30%. 
If either BH or Mr H dispute that this is a reasonable assumption, they must let us 
know as soon as possible so that the assumption can be clarified and Mr H receives 
appropriate compensation. It wont be possible for us to amend this assumption once 
any final decision has been issued on the complaint. Income tax may be payable on any interest awarded

Notional Value
This is the value of Mr H's investment had it remained as it was prior to the move to gold and 
cash until the end date. 
Any additional sum that Mr H paid into either investment should be added to the notional 
value calculation at the point it was actually paid in. 
Any withdrawal from the ISA or SIPP should be deducted from the notional value calculation 
at the point it was actually paid so it ceases to accrue any return in the calculation from that 
point on. If there is a large number of regular payments, to keep calculations simpler, Ill 
accept if BH totals all those payments and deducts that figure at the end to determine the 
notional value instead of deducting periodically.
Responses to my provisional decision
BH responded and made the following points:
Mr H was an experienced investor and was fully aware of risk and reward, happy to 
switch money around as required to make it work and protect it in uncertain times.
He was sent the recommendation to withdraw from the equity component of his 
portfolio in May 2020 and contrary to the decision, the Property/Multi-Asset/Absolute 
return components totalling 20% of the portfolio as well as gold remained.
Mr H researched gold extensively himself and concurred with the recommendation 
using the phrase Great proactive work. This response showed he agreed with the 
recommendation. He was at liberty to reject the recommendation and the portfolio 
would have remained untouched.They believed Mr H to be upset because he made a choice which in hindsight didnt 
go in his favour. It followed that had the portfolio performed well, he would have been 
happy.
The statement I think a recommendation to move his entire holdings into gold and 
cash, even taking into account the volatility in the markets, was contrary to his 
objectives and ATR. assumed that Mr H wasnt allowed to make variations in light of 
mid 2020 events. This again showed the benefit of hindsight and Mr Hs agreement 
to the recommendation shows that at least a temporary change in objectives was in 
his mind at the time.
Mr H had received a strong level of service from BH as supported by the evidence on 
file.
Mr H responded and said:
He is a basic rate taxpayer and this has been the situation for several years now and 
at retirement he will still be a basic rate taxpayer. He would have been able to take a 
tax-free lump sum, so the reduction should be applied to 75% of the compensation, 
resulting in an overall reduction of 15%.
Concerning the notional value calculation there was an additional lump sum of 
£40,000 added to the SIPP in March 2021 and this should be considered in the 
notional value calculation, as it disguised and masked the magnitude of the actual 
loss, incurred at the end date. There were no withdrawals from either investment.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
After reconsidering the available evidence including the new submissions from both parties, 
Im not persuaded to depart from my provisional outcome, I will now explain why. 
I note the points BH have raised regarding Mr Hs level of experience and the research he 
carried out into gold. Ive carefully thought about what theyve said, but the only evidence of 
research into gold Ive seen is a link to an article Mr H sent to his advisor at BH. In his email, 
he also asked where he could find unbiased, balanced investment advice. I dont think this 
demonstrates extensive research and certainly doesnt absolve BH of their responsibility to 
provide suitable advice to Mr H. 
I dont think its unreasonable to say that even during times of market volatility, a business 
must ensure that a recommendation is suitable for their client. They must also ensure that 
their recommendation meets their clients objectives, and the client understands the risks 
involved. As Ive said in my provisional decision, I havent seen where Mr H - who was 
classified as having an adventurous ATR - was advised of the risks associated with moving 
into gold and cash at that point and the impact of crystallising any losses already incurred by 
leaving the market. Therefore, in my opinion the recommendation was imbalanced, and Im 
not satisfied that Mr H was given enough information to make an informed decision. 
I accept that Mr H was free to reject the recommendation. But as hed been BHs client for a 
number of years, I dont think it was unreasonable for him to expect that any 
recommendations made to him were suitable for his circumstances. During a time of such 
volatility in the markets, its only natural for an investor to heavily rely on their professional 
advisor. I think that if the advisor had properly considered Mr Hs objectives, ATR and fully explained 
the downsides of the proposed strategy then its more likely than not that Mr H wouldnt have 
accepted the recommendation given his overall investment objectives. I think that his profile 
is indicative of an investor who is willing to accept short term loss in the pursuit of long term 
gains. The advice to move into cash and gold indefinitely, without a proper explanation of the 
risks involved, is at odds with that profile and therefore unsuitable. 
I note the points BH have raised about only the equity element of Mr Hs portfolio being sold. 
I accept what theyve said but this doesnt change my opinion. The end result of the advice 
was that Mr Hs equity holdings - 70% of his portfolio - was moved to cash and gold funds 
which, for the reasons Ive previously given, was unsuitable for his circumstances at the 
time. Therefore, BH needs to calculate if theres been any financial loss and put things right 
if there has been.
Ive noted the points Mr H has raised about his tax status and amended the redress 
calculation accordingly. The calculation already accounts for additional payments, so no 
amendment is required for the lump sum he added in March 2021.
Putting things right
Compare the performance of Mr H's investments with the notional value if he had 
remained with the previous investments. If the actual value is greater than the 
notional value, no compensation is payable. If the notional value is greater than the 
actual value, there is a loss and compensation of the difference between the notional 
and actual values is payable. 
BH should also add any interest set out below to the compensation payable. 
If there is a loss on his SIPP portfolio, BH should pay into Mr H's pension plan to 
increase its value by the amount of the compensation and any interest. The amount 
paid should allow for the effect of charges and any available tax relief. Compensation 
should not be paid into the pension plan if it would conflict with any existing 
protection or allowance. 
If BH is unable to pay the compensation into Mr H's pension plan, it should pay that 
amount direct to him. But had it been possible to pay into the plan, it would have 
provided a taxable income. Therefore the compensation should be reduced to 
notionally allow for any income tax that would otherwise have been paid. This is an 
adjustment to ensure the compensation is a fair amount  it isnt a payment of tax to 
HMRC, so Mr H wont be able to reclaim any of the reduction after compensation is 
paid. 
If Mr H has remaining tax-free cash entitlement, 25% of the loss would be tax-free 
and 75% would have been taxed according to their likely income tax rate in 
retirement  presumed to be 20%. So making a notional reduction of 15% overall 
from the loss adequately reflects this.
Income tax may be payable on any interest awarded

Any withdrawal from the ISA or SIPP should be deducted from the notional value calculation 
at the point it was actually paid so it ceases to accrue any return in the calculation from that 
point on. If there is a large number of regular payments, to keep calculations simpler, Ill 
accept if BH totals all those payments and deducts that figure at the end to determine the 
notional value instead of deducting periodically.
If BH are unable to calculate a notional value, they will need to determine a fair value for Mr 
Hs investments instead using this benchmark: FTSE UK Private Investors Income Total 
Return Index. The adjustments above also apply to the calculation of a fair value using the 
benchmark, which is then used instead of the notional value in the calculation of 
compensation. 
My final decision
I uphold the complaint. Bank House Consultants Limited must redress Mr H as set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 September 2023.
