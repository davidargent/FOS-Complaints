Mr C says NewDay Limited, trading  as Aqua,  has treated  him unfairly  in relation to his credit  
card debt.
Background
Earlier this month I issued  a provisional decision saying that I was minded to uphold  the 
complaint and suggesting NewDay  paid Mr C £350 in distress  and inconvenience. I invited 
both parties to let me have any further  submissions before I reached my final decision. Both 
parties have responded and both have  agreed  to my position.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Considering the respective positions  of the parties  I see no persuasive reason to deviate 
from the position as set out in my provisional decision. So NewDay  should  pay £350 to Mr C 
directly for the distress and inconvenience suffered. If he chooses  to offset this against his 
outstanding balance with NewDay it must allow him to do so.
What the business needs  to do
Pay Mr C £350 for the distress and inconvenience caused if it hasnt already done so. And 
once it has done  this it should  go through its income and expenditure process with Mr C to 
establish how much  Mr C should be paying back on the outstanding amount.
my final decision
For the above reasons and those described in my provisional decision attached  
NewDay Limited should make payment as I have  described above.  It should then go through 
its income and expenditure process  with Mr C regarding his outstanding debt.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 July 2019.

complaint
Mr C says NewDay  Limited, trading as Aqua,  has treated him unfairly in relation to his credit card 
debt.
background
Due to some tragic circumstances  Mr C found himself with significant  debt on his credit card and 
unable to work. He told NewDay of the close family bereavement in December 2017 and a couple of 
months later informed  NewDay that he had cancer . Mr C has provided evidence  of these  substantial  
personal issues to NewDay and this service and Mr Cs personal circumstances  are accepted by all 
parties.
In June 2018  NewDay sent Mr C a Default Notice asking  him to pay £38.12 by the 17th July 2018. 
This notice says if he doesnt pay then further action  may be taken  against him including  terminating  
the agreement, closing the account and asking  him to pay the outstanding balance immediately.
Mr C rang NewDay on the 2nd July 2018. NewDays  contemporaneous records of this call include Cst 
has Cancer. Undergoing  treatment. Have held 12 months and set (sic) out letter to advise.
NewDays timeline of events  in its business file to this service says July 2018 - received med 
evidence from (named) hospital to advise undergoing  treatment for cancer - hold for 12 months 
applied and letter sent to advise.
NewDays letter dated 2nd July confirms that there  is a hold in place on your account  to prevent 
further collections activity.
In a separate letter dated  2nd July NewDay says We are sorry  to hear of your circumstances and 
considering these we will hold the above  account from further  collection activity  until 2nd July 2019. 
During this time we will withhold payment on the account and also suspend all interest and charges.
On the 11th August 2018 NewDay wrote to Mr C and said weve terminated your Aqua Classic  Credit  
Card agreement. Your  account is now with NewDays Debt Recovery Unit and your full balance of 
£1,905.52 is now due Please call us on (phone number)  so we can
set up an affordable  plan to help you repay what you owe.
In NewDays letter of 28th August 2018  it refers  to a call between NewDay  and Mr C on 9th July 2018 
and says The agent to whom you spoke explained that the hold placed  on your account,  stopped all 
collections activities and she did advise that even  if payments were received  from you, interest and 
charges would not resume  until the account was again reviewed in July 2019.
On the 6th September 2018 NewDay wrote to Mr C saying At the times the Default and Termination 
Notices were sent, which was on 26 June and 11 August  2018 respectively,  we were not actively 
pursuing payments from you. Therefore, these  notices were sent to you
for information purposes only.
NewDay have recently confirmed that the account is closed and so Mr C cannot  use the credit  card, 
but the debt remains and he can pay towards this debt to reduce the amount he owes.  NewDay may 
decide to sell the debt on in future. 
Mr C complained to NewDay and it said it had followed  its processes so although it had made some 
payments to Mr C to recognise  service failings it wouldnt uphold his complaint about  unfairly having 
his agreement terminated.  So Mr C complained to this service.
Ref: DRN18762403Our adjudicator upheld the complaint and asked the business  to unwind everything that had 
happened back to July 2018 including reopening Mr Cs account.  NewDay disagreed and so this 
complaint has come  to me for a decision.
My provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. 
Firstly I should state that I am terribly  sorry to hear of Mr Cs very sad loss of a family member,  which I 
recognise must be very traumatic. I should  also add that his circumstances have been compounded 
by his illness. These  are highly distressing circumstances that Mr C was (and is still) in.
Having considered  the adjudicators views I broadly  agree that NewDay has not acted  as it should 
and that this complaint  should be upheld.  However  I think the manner in which  this complaint should  
be resolved is different to what the adjudicator has said. And in the interests of fairness to all parties  I 
think I should  give them the opportunity to comment on my proposed settlement before issuing  a final 
decision.
Mr C wants  his credit card account reopened and to be able to use the facilities on this account that 
he used to be able to. However  it is not for this service to force parties into contractual  relationships 
which either party  do not wish to be in. And it isnt for this service to make binding  decisions in relation 
to the commercial decisions of businesses.
NewDay has decided it no longer wants  to provide  the credit  card facilities  to Mr C that it has in the 
past. And in August 2018 it told him this. As this is its commercial decision  this service  cannot  now 
force NewDay  to reopen Mr Cs credit  card account even though that is what  
Mr C wants.  
However it is clear  NewDays assurances to Mr C about how it was going  to treat him when he 
discussed matters with it during the summer  of 2018 didnt marry up with his reasonable expectations. 
Mr C has provided strong, consistent and persuasive testimony  that he understood NewDays position  
to be in essence  that it was putting his account  on hold and wouldnt be doing  anything significant  for 
twelve months. And bearing in mind comments NewDay has made  such as his account being on 
hold and hold the above account from further collection activity it seems to me that Mr Cs position 
was reasonable here. 
It is also important  to note that Mr C has repeatedly said he was told to ignore automated  letters from 
NewDay. And NewDay in its dealing with his complaint has said some  letters were sent to him for 
information only. It seems clear to me that NewDay accepts its failed  to make  clear to Mr C what the 
true situation  was. And hence it is unsurprising that Mr C would have been significantly distressed  on 
reading of NewDays termination letter in August  2019. Particularly considering  he had repeatedly 
liaised with NewDay about his family bereavement and then through his diagnosis with cancer  and 
later treatment.
NewDay is obliged to report on Mr Cs credit file his payment  behaviours with it. And it is obliged to do 
so factually and accurately.  I have  considered  its credit file reporting and consider it to be factual  and 
accurate. So Im not persuaded NewDay has done anything  wrong here.
Mr C has always been clear that he accepts he has the debt with NewDay. And although 
Mr C has faced a terrible situation he is now working  again. NewDay is obliged to treat customers  in 
financial difficulty positively  and sympathetically. And I can see that it froze  interest and charges  for an 
extended period of time. So Im satisfied it did treat him as it should. Mr C accepts  he owes the 
outstanding balance and NewDay is entitled to pursue him for it if it chooses to do so. So it would be 
advisable for Mr C and NewDay to come to some mutually acceptable plan for repaying the debt.
Ref: DRN18762404It is clear to me that Mr C has made clear his position to NewDay regularly,  truthfully and with the 
support of evidence even though faced with clearly tragic events. He clearly has been somewhat  
clearer in his position than NewDay has in its position with regard  to him.
The crux of this complaint is how NewDay has communicated with Mr C. Im not persuaded it has 
acted unfairly  or outside  of its commercial decision making in what  it has done with regard to the debt 
itself or the reporting of it on Mr Cs credit  file. However  I am satisfied that it has failed to be clear  in its 
articulating its position  to Mr C. Especially when you consider it accepts it wrote to him for information 
only even though those letters were clearly important, worrying and demanding payment. 
As a consequence of this and considering  Mr Cs particular and rare circumstances  in 2018 I think  it 
only fair that I make  a significant award  of distress and inconvenience here. 
NewDay has recently  said it was willing to make an offer of £250 to Mr C to recognise his distress and 
inconvenience. But I dont  think this is enough. Mr C was in financial difficulties due to bereavement  
and then suffering from cancer. He had numerous contacts with NewDay and it told him repeatedly 
his account was on hold whilst he got better. And then it terminated his account. I am currently 
minded that £350 better represents what happened here.
NewDay will pay this directly to Mr C and it will be up to him whether he uses that money  to reduce  
the outstanding balance he has with NewDay.
I am also aware that NewDay told Mr C that it wouldnt take action against  him before 
July 2019. Consequently I direct NewDay to reappraise  Mr Cs income and expenditure in July 2019 
by asking  him to complete  its process at that time. And I remind NewDay in its obligation to treat 
customers in financial difficulty positively  and sympathetically.
my provisional  decision
For the above  reasons,  I am currently  minded  to uphold this complaint about  NewDay limited. I am 
currently minded  to direct  NewDay to pay £350 in distress and inconvenience to Mr C. And it should  
go through its income and expenditure process in July 2019 to establish how much Mr C should be 
paying back.
I now invite  both parties to provide me with any further submissions they wish to have taken  into 
account within  the timeline that Ive described  earlier, after which I will issue my final decision.
