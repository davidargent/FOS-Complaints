The complaint
Mr F complains that National Westminster Bank Plc decided to close his accounts and 
blocked his card. Hed like compensation for the impact on him. 
What happened
Mr F has a number of accounts with NatWest including current accounts, a credit card and a 
mortgage. 
On 17 February 2022 NatWest sent Mr F a letter informing him that his accounts, including 
his current account and credit cards, would be closed within 60 days. The letter also 
informed him that any borrowing would need to be repaid at that time.
Mr F complained to NatWest and asked them to reconsider their decision regarding the 
closure. He believed that theyd likely made the decision to close his account because of the 
account activity, which he provided explanations for. This included money hed received from 
his partner to pay for a house purchase. 
Mr F brought his complaint to our service. 
Whilst NatWest were reviewing their decision to close Mr Fs account he also asked whether 
the bank would extend the time for the debt repayment by 30 days  which NatWest agreed 
to do. 
NatWest reviewed their decision, and on 28 April 2022 reversed their decision to close his 
accounts. 
But, Mr F remained unhappy with NatWests actions. He argued theyd discriminated against 
him because of his sexuality and due to his neurodiversity. Mr F also explained that on 
19 April 2022 his debit card was blocked and he was prevented from using it whilst on 
holiday abroad. He explained this led to direct debits being rejected, late payment fees being 
applied and a negative impact to his credit file as a result. He also advises he couldnt get a 
mortgage as a result. 
One of our investigators looked into Mr Fs complaint. He asked NatWest to explain their 
reason for making the decision to close Mr Fs accounts. Our investigator wasnt satisfied 
with the reasons given by NatWest, and although they made the decision to reverse this he 
thought Mr F was caused distress by their actions. In particular our investigator wasnt 
satisfied that NatWest had effectively investigated Mr Fs allegation he was discriminated 
against by the bank  and thought it wasnt unreasonable for Mr F to conclude the bank was 
discriminating against him when withdrawing his facilities. Our investigator recommended for 
NatWest to pay Mr F £650 in compensation. 
NatWest accepted our investigators recommendation. However Mr F didnt, and thought the 
compensation wasnt sufficient. In response he said:
NatWests actions left his mother homeless and hes not had contact with his family 
since.
He experienced severe mental health and suicidal ideation due to NatWests actions.
He spent around 150 hours on the phone and should be compensated £3,750 for this 
alone.
He wasnt able to eat or drink for around two days whilst on holiday. 
As Mr F didnt agree its been passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im very aware that Ive summarised the events in this complaint in far less detail than the 
parties and Ive done so using my own words. No discourtesy is intended by me in taking 
this approach. Instead, Ive focussed on what I think are the key issues here. Our rules allow 
me to do this. This simply reflects the informal nature of our service as a free alternative to 
the courts. If theres something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive ignored it. Im 
satisfied I dont need to comment on every individual argument to be able to reach what I 
think is the right outcome. I do stress however that Ive considered everything that Mr F and 
NatWest have said before reaching my decision.
Decision to close Mr Fs accounts
NatWest can only close accounts in certain circumstances and if its in the terms and 
conditions of the account. The terms and conditions of Mr Fs current account advise they 
can close it for any reason by providing 60 days notice. NatWest arent required to share 
their reasons for closing an account with their customer, however they do need to explain 
their decision to our service. 
NatWest have provided limited information to our service regarding their reasons for 
deciding to close Mr Fs account  however, Im not satisfied its enough for me to conclude 
they acted fairly in deciding to do so. Im aware that NatWest reversed their decision, but I 
still need to consider whether their initial decision to close his accounts was fair. 
Importantly Mr Fs also alleged NatWest discriminated against him because of his sexuality 
and neurodiversity which hes advised the bank about. 
NatWest informed our investigator that they didnt discriminate against Mr F. 
My role is to review whether NatWest treated Mr F fairly and their actions were reasonable. 
Mr Fs complaint involves an allegation of discrimination based on a protected characteristic. 
Were required to take the Equality Act 2010 into account when dealing with complaints of 
this nature when deciding whats fair and reasonable. But its not for our service to make a 
decision about whether a business has breached the Equality Act 2010. Thats the role of 
the Courts. Where we decide a business hasnt acted reasonably, well ask the business to 
put things right for the consumer.
Although Im satisfied NatWest acted in line with the terms and conditions in respect of the 
notice given to Mr F, what theyve provided, isnt sufficient for me to conclude that they 
treated Mr F fairly when deciding to close his account. In particular, Ive seen no evidence to suggest that NatWest looked into the allegation of discrimination at the time or took steps to 
address his concerns. In the absence of an investigation and/or appropriate response from 
NatWest, I dont think it was unreasonable of Mr F to conclude hed been discriminated 
against  irrespective of whether or not he actually was. I say this as Mr F advised me that 
he shared details about his protected characteristics with NatWest, prior to their decision to 
close his accounts. 
Account block
NatWest have advised our service that Mr Fs account, including his debit card, was 
incorrectly blocked between 20 April 2022 and 28 April 2022. Mr F informed our service that 
his card was blocked on two occasions. Once prior to when he was travelling abroad and a 
period during the time he was away. 
NatWest and Mr F have different views on the timeframe of the block, but importantly both 
agree that his account was blocked. And NatWest accept that this was an error on their part. 
So I dont need to assess whether or NatWest acted fairly in blocking Mr Fs access. Instead 
I need to consider the impact of the block of Mr F  hes explained that as a result direct 
debits on his accounts were blocked, he was charged late payment fees and experienced 
inconvenience when on holiday due to not being able to use his card for food, drink and 
departure tax. 
Ive firstly considered the missed direct debits and late payment fees Mr F incurred as a 
result of the block. NatWest have informed me that a unpaid transaction fee of £2.15 was 
imposed on one of Mr Fs accounts  but no other direct debits were returned. This fee has 
since been refunded to Mr F. 
Ive reviewed the account statements for the time period Mr Fs account was due to close 
and I cant see that Mr F had any direct debits that were due and went unpaid. 
Ive also not seen that NatWest applied any markers to Mr Fs credit file, or elsewhere, which 
would have impacted on his ability to obtain alternative lending or credit outside of the 
NatWest group.
Putting things right
Ive considered the impact of NatWests actions on Mr F  Im satisfied he experienced 
significant distress when NatWest decided to close it, which was exacerbated by his belief 
they discriminated against him. I think Mr F also experienced inconvenience in being unable 
to use his debit card after NatWest had agreed the account wouldnt close. 
Ive considered Mr Fs response to our investigators view, providing details on why he thinks 
the compensation award should be higher than £650. But, Im afraid I dont agree. Im 
satisfied £650 appropriately awards Mr F for the impact of NatWests actions including the 
detriment caused to his mental health and the inconvenience caused in not being able to use 
the card. Mr F also added that his mother was made homeless, however our service can 
only award compensation to the account holder. Mr F also said he should be compensated 
at an hourly rate for the phone calls he made to NatWest. However, our service doesnt 
award distress and inconvenience payments in this way. So I wont be awarding Mr F 
compensation for each hour he was on the phone to the bank. 
For these reasons I think Mr F should be compensated £650. My final decision
My final decision is I direct National Westminster Bank Plc to:
Pay Mr F £650 compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused to him
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 December 2023.
