K821x#15complaint
Mr G has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr G says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny.
background
We now know that Mr G took out 56 instalment loans from Sunny between  September 2016  
and October 2018.  Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Gs borrowing with Sunny, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan 5 onwards. Sunny doesnt  agree with this although it did offer to 
partially settle the complaint which was declined by Mr G. The complaint has therefore come 
to me for an ombudsmans  final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Mr Gs 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Mr G could repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought  to 
have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN36429342There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr G could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr G. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of lending history with 
a view to seeing  if there  was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loans 1 - 4 ought not to be upheld 
as they appeared affordable. Ive looked  carefully at these and taken note of Mr Gs declared 
income. Ive also looked at what he said about his monthly expenditure. 
With this information,  and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks which Sunny most likely carried  out appear to have  
been proportionate for loans 1  4. And I think these  levels  of checks,  together  with the 
income and expenditure details provided  by Mr G, would  have  made those particular loans 
appear affordable  for him. 
However, I think from the point of loan 5 onwards in this case  things would have  looked  
different and therefore required  a more thorough and responsible approach. For loan 4, for 
example, Sunny ought to have been aware  this was his fifth such  loan in 2 months. Previous 
Sunny loan instalments hed taken out were also still outstanding  at the time. Loan 5 also 
saw an increase in the amount Mr G borrowed so he didnt seem to be making any inroads 
into his indebtedness.
Theres no evidence Sunny altered its approach at the point of loan 5 to look more 
thoroughly at Mr Gs financial situation. I think if it had done  this it would have shown he was 
having trouble  managing his money and was probably borrowing to meet normal  ongoing 
commitments and those of other borrowing. I think if Sunnys checks had been more  
appropriate this would  have also included looking at Mr Gs recent financial transactions, for 
example on his bank  statements. This would have exposed the apparent frequent  use of on-
line betting sites.  So with all this information available, I think it was irresponsible to lend to 
Mr G at the point of loan 5 and 6. He clearly  was having problems managing  money.
In addition to the above,  I agree with our adjudicator that from the point of loan 7 onwards,  
there was a very clear and obvious pattern of repeated lending  evident. Loan 7 saw an 
increase in lending to the highest  amount  so far and thereafter there is a general pattern 
whereby Mr G was being lent multiple  loans, often within the same month on a consistent 
basis. Theres no evidence Sunny altered its approach to checking Mr Gs financial situation 
and the lending was irresponsible.  
Ref: DRN36429343So Im also upholding  Mr Gs complaint in respect  of loans 7 - 56 as well. Sunny repeatedly 
lent to Mr G in an unsustainable manner because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely  to have had negative 
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 7 - 56;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges on these from 
the date they were  paid (if they were)  to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 5 and 6 from Mr Gs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7  56 should be completely  
removed from Mr Gs credit file. If any debts were sold I direct  Sunny to ensure this is 
done.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Mr G a certificate  
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Mr Gs complaint. Elevate Credit  International Limited 
should put things right for Mr G as set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 12 March  2020.
