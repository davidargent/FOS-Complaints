K821x#15complaint
Mr C complains about the short term loans he took out with Casheuronet UK LLC trading as 
QuickQuid. Mr C says that QuickQuid failed to identify  that he was dependent  on short term 
lending. This is because it failed to perform  adequate affordability checks. 
background
Mr C took out seven loans between July 2015 and September 2016.  Some  of the information

QuickQuid has looked at Mr Cs complaint  and said that it shouldnt be upheld. It said that it 
did appropriate checks for all of the lending. And these checks showed that the loans were  
affordable. So it thought  it was reasonable to lend to Mr C.  
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Cs complaint and recommended that QuickQuid refund 
the interest and charges that he paid on loans 3 to 7. QuickQuid didnt agree with this 
recommendation and so the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
One of our adjudicators has looked at what Mr C and QuickQuid said.  They  thought Mr Cs 
complaint should  be partially upheld. He thought that it had made  proportionate checks  for 
loans 1 and 2. So he thought that QuickQuids decisions to lend on these loans  were  
reasonable. 
But didnt think that QuickQuid had made proportionate checks for loans 3 to 7, including the 
top up on loan 7 (loan 7a on my table).  He thought  if it had, then it wouldnt have approved 
these loans. This is because he didnt think that Mr C could afford  the repayments. And 
QuickQuid wouldve seen  this had it completed  better checks.  
QuickQuid didnt comment  on our adjudicators  findings about the proportionality of its 
checks or the affordability of the loans,  nor did it provide any new information for me to 
consider. It responded to our adjudication saying:
Ref: DRN04189672Thank you for taking  the time to review Mr C's complaint. In response to FOS assessment 
which recommends CashEuroNet UK uphold loans which were funded after March 2015, we 
regret to inform you that we cannot agree to FOS recommendations.  Please note that in 
CashEuroNet UKs  initial  response to FOS we provided detailed  information indicating why 
the loan(s) were responsibly lent to Mr C. Furthermore, we would like to advise that we are 
currently in talks with senior management at FOS to amicably resolve  this outstanding issue, 
therefore we kindly ask that you move  this case for ombudsman  queue for a final decision. 
That said when the case was referred  to an ombudsman  QuickQuid  contacted the Financial 
Ombudsman Service and said that it had not provided full information about  why it thought 
the loans were responsibly lent. It said that:
We started implementing changes to affordability assessments in June  2014  and all the 
changes were completed by Feb 28th 2015. Starting 1st March  2015 before Mr C borrowed 
his first loan,  QuickQuid had implemented an affordability review that is consistent with the 
FCA Handbook and that was in place at the time we received authorisation by the FCA. We 
confirm that this assessment was conducted  properly  and individually  for each of these last 
five loans. 
It provided further detail  about the checks it had made when it approved  the lending  in 2015 
and onwards in a document called CEU  Lending Criteria and Proportional Checks.  This 
document didnt  have  any personalised information about Mr Cs complaint itself and it didnt 
change our adjudicators  opinion.  
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic  argument  directly and through 
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to address this point here,  though I have considered 
it alongside everything else in making  my decision.  
I would remind Quick  Quid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  in 
how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent 
who handled  the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  
complaints received by the respondent and using this in training and development of 
the individuals dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the 
Financial Ombudsman  Service  and communicating it to the individuals dealing  with 
complaints in the respondent.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Cs complaint and what  both parties  have said 
about this.
As Mr C didnt  disagree with our adjudicators  opinion  about loans 1 and 2, I dont think  there 
is any ongoing disagreement about  these  loans. So I wont  be making  a decision about this 
lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr C had with QuickQuid. As such  
they are something  I will take into account  when considering the other loans  he took.
Ref: DRN04189673Having reviewed the evidence I have available,  I think  QuickQuid was wrong to have given 
Mr C loans 3 to 7a. Ill explain why: 
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr C borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in mind  
the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit 
Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect  a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect QuickQuid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks
the higher  the loan amount
the lower the consumers income
the longer  the lending relationship.
QuickQuid says:
 
Mr Cs income  and expenditure. It recorded  his monthly income  as being £1,300 for 
loan 3 and £1,500  for loans 4 to 7. His monthly  expenditure  was recorded as £375 
it found out that Mr C had no dependents  and he was living with his parents 
it looked at credit  reference agency  information, its provided the information from 
one of the credit checks it did in November 2017
it used the information  it had gained  from the credit reports to adjust the amounts 
Mr C had provided. It calculated what it called his monthly estimated disposable 
income (EDI) which is shown on my table  above
And based on what it saw from this it thought  it reasonable  to lend to Mr C.
why I dont  think QuickQuids checks were  proportionate for loans 3 to 7
Ive carefully thought  about what QuickQuid and Mr C have provided and what both sides  
have said. 
For loan 3 Mr C needed to make three repayments.  The first two were under £100  but the 
third was near £400. This was his third loan without  a significant break and it would mean 
that by the end of the contract he wouldve been  borrowing  from QuickQuid for just over 
seven months. And Mr C went on to borrow from QuickQuid, for varying amounts, for just 
under a year and a half.  
So I think QuickQuid shouldve realised  at that time, that Mr C may have some longer term 
financial problems rather than using  the loans to help with a temporary cash flow problem. 
QuickQuid shouldve also become concerned about whether it knew enough about Mr Cs 
true financial  situation.
So before approving loan 3, and for the remainder  of the lending,  I think  that QuickQuid 
needed to get an accurate picture of Mr Cs finances. It shouldve  fully reviewed this 
information in order to make sure he was in position  to make the repayments sustainably.
Ref: DRN04189674QuickQuid hasnt provided enough information to allow me to say that it carried out 
proportionate checks. 
Although I havent  seen  the full details  of all QuickQuids credit checks, it has provided me 
with its estimate of Mr Cs disposable income.  This is lower than deducting Mr Cs declared  
expenditure from his declared income  for loans 3, 4 and 6. I dont know  exactly  how 
QuickQuid calculated Mr Cs EDI  but it has said that credit checks  are one relevant factor.
But because I dont  know how QuickQuid actually  worked out the EDI, I cant say this 
reflects a proportionate check. I think in Mr Cs circumstances,  a proportionate check 
wouldve included QuickQuid making sure it had fully reviewed his finances to get sufficient 
information about all of Mr Cs credit commitments, living costs and expenditure. 
QuickQuid doesnt  seem to have  fully reviewed Mr Cs finances. So I need  to think about 
what its likely proportionate checks wouldve shown QuickQuid if it had. 
what I think proportionate checks would most  likely have  shown QuickQuid  for loans 
3 to 7
Mr C has provided some  information about his financial  circumstances. This includes his 
bank statements and a recent credit  report. I accept that this isnt exactly  what  QuickQuid 
wouldve seen at the time. But I think  proportionate  checks wouldve revealed similar 
information, so I think  its reasonable to rely on it.
It isnt entirely clear what Mr Cs income  and expenditure was at the time he borrowed from 
QuickQuid. His income  seems to be on average  not too far away from what  QuickQuid 
recorded. And his general expenditure also seems low. I can see some evidence  of other 
credit commitments  but they arent  regular  or particularly high.  
But as our adjudicator  outlined,  by this stage, proportionate checks  wouldve also shown 
QuickQuid that a substantial portion of Mr Cs income was being spent on gambling. The 
amounts Mr C spent were always high and sometimes  he could spend over £7,000  a month.  
And I think that if QuickQuid wouldve seen this, it wouldnt have thought it was responsible 
to lend to Mr C.
I think that QuickQuid wouldve found  out this information if it had made  proportionate  
checks. And I think QuickQuid wouldve seen Mr C wouldnt  have been  able repay loans 
3 to 7 in a sustainable  way. So I think that QuickQuid shouldnt have given loans 3 to 7 to Mr 
C and I think hes lost out as a result of this. So Im upholding Mr Cs complaint about loans 
3 to 7. 
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
To put things right for Mr C, QuickQuid should:
refund all the interest and charges applied as a result  of loans 3 to 7 (including the top 
up on loan 7, loan7a)
add interest at 8% per year simple  on the above interest and charges from the date 
they were paid, if they were, to the date of settlement
Ref: DRN04189675remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Cs credit  file about these loans
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Cs complaint.
Casheuronet UK LLC should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 March  2019.
