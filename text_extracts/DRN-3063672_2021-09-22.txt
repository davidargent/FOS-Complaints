The complaint
Mrs F, as a director of M, complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA blocked Ms 
account and refused to allow a withdrawal of the account balance.
What happened
Mrs F says PayPal blocked Ms account in January 2021 which contained a balance of just 
over £450. She says she complied with PayPals requests for information to unblock the 
account but kept going around in circles trying to comply with its requests. Mrs F says 
PayPal accepted it had a known issue in sorting matters out and says she provided the 
information, but it took until April 2021 for the money to be returned. She would like 
compensation paid to the company for the inconvenience it was caused.
PayPal says it was required to ask M for the information as part of its regulatory duties and 
says M didnt provide the information. It says it followed correct procedures and unblocked 
the account when it received the required information.
Mrs F, on behalf of M, brought the complaint to us and provided a lengthy copy of the 
exchange between M and PayPal over the nearly four-month period. The investigator upheld 
the complaint and accepted PayPal had regulatory duties. But thought PayPal could have 
done more to sort matters out and hadnt responded to M. He recommended PayPal pay M 
£75 compensation for that and also thought the copy of the exchange between the parties 
provided clear evidence that PayPal could have dealt more appropriately with the complaint.
M accepts the investigators view, but PayPal doesnt and says M didnt provide the required 
information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the same overall view as the investigator and for the same 
reasons.
I appreciate PayPal has regulatory duties that on occasions require it to ask its customers for 
certain information and evidence of identification. But I also think the money in the PayPal 
account was not its but Ms and that any such regulatory duties should be carried out within 
a reasonable time period to avoid inconvenience to customers.
I have looked carefully at the exchange between M and PayPal between January 2021 and 
April 2021. And Im satisfied that PayPal could have dealt more appropriately with M. I think 
it could have responded far quicker than it did and been clearer in its dealings with M. I also 
think there were requests for information that had been previously supplied and letters telling 
M that the complaint had been resolved when it hadnt.
Overall having reviewed the copy of the exchange Im satisfied that matters could have been 
resolved far quicker than they were and more effectively. For those reasons Im satisfied that 
PayPal should pay M £75 compensation for the inconvenience it suffered. I find that award 
to be fair and reasonable. 
Putting things right
PayPal should pay M £75 compensation
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to 
pay M £75 compensation
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask M to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 October 2021.
