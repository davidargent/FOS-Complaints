Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Cs complaint and thought the loans from loan 4 
onwards shouldnt have been given as they thought Miss C wouldnt be able to make her 
repayments sustainably without borrowing more and the pattern of borrowing indicated  Miss 
C was reliant on short-term loans. Sunny disagreed but offered to uphold loan 8 instead. 
Miss C didnt respond to Sunnys offer so, the complaint was passed to me.
 
 
 
 My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss C could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough 
checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing 
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss C could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Cs complaint. Having done so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain why. 
Our adjudicator didnt think Sunny needed to more when it approved loans 1 to 3. Miss C 
didnt respond to the view. As there no longer appears to be a dispute about this loan, I wont 
be making further findings on it.
Sunny says it carried out checks before it lent loan 4 to Miss C and the results of these 
checks didnt raise any concerns. But as this was Miss Cs fourth loan in five months and 
she still had loans 1, 2 and 3 outstanding, I think Sunny should have been looking to build a 
clear picture than it did about Miss Cs finances before it lent to her again.Had Sunny carried out proportionate checks before lending loan 4, its likely to have found 
that Miss C was borrowing from other short-term lenders and these repayments were 
increasing her monthly outgoings significantly. For example, in June 2018 these repayments 
increased Miss Cs outgoings by over £900  and this was before she made the repayments 
on the three loans she had with Sunny. So, the likelihood of Miss C having to borrow again 
to sustainable repay her loans was high. I think this was shown when Miss C took out loan 5 
a month after taking out loan 4 and two days after she repaid loan 1. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Miss Cs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss C was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss C had taken out six loans in eight months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Miss C was having to borrow further to 
cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that 
    Miss Cs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss C wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 8 was 
taken out just over nine after Miss Cs first. And it was for a larger amount. Miss C 
had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
 
I think that Miss C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Cs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Miss C borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Miss Cs ability to access mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, Im upholding Miss Cs complaint about loans 4 to 8 and Sunny should put things right. 
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss C paid on loan 4 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4 and 5 from Miss Cs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 6, 7 and 8 should be removed from 
Miss Cs credit file.
                                                                                                                                 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
  
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Miss Cs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 July 2020.
