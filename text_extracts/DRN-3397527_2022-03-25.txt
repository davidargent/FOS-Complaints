The complaint
H, a limited company, has complained about its commercial property insurance broker 
MacDonald Group GI LLP, as it believes it caused it to incur losses by delaying notifying 
insurers of Hs claim for water damage.
What happened
Water damage was found to Hs property in June 2018 with flooring having to be replaced. 
H called MacDonald to notify it of the claim but was told a claim couldnt be made as the 
damage might have been caused by a lack of maintenance. H set about challenging that. 
But, later, when H went directly to the insurer, the insurer initially refused the claim, as the 
policy required notification within a set time period. However, after receiving details of the 
contact H had made to MacDonald, the insurer accepted the claim and paid for floor repairs.
H felt that if MacDonald had referred the claim to the insurer earlier it wouldnt have had to 
pay for a leak report at a cost of £702. MacDonald wouldnt cover that cost though. It felt that 
was a cost H would always have had to pay to evidence its valid claim. But it accepted it 
could have provided a better service so offered £200 compensation. H accepted the £200 as 
compensation for inconvenience caused by MacDonalds service failings. But still wanted it 
to make up for the financial loss. H complained to us.
Our investigator felt the leak report was a cost H would always have had to incur in order to 
show a valid claim. He didnt think its cost had been incurred due to any failure or delay by 
MacDonald. So he didnt recommend it reimburse the sum of £702. H was unhappy and the 
complaint was passed for an ombudsmans decision.
In short I felt that MacDonald had, effectively taken on the role of the insurer by requiring H 
to prove it had a valid claim. And I noted MacDonalds concerns related to a lack of 
maintenance being a possible cause of the damage  which the leak report showed was not 
the case. So I thought that MacDonald should reimburse the cost of the report, plus interest* 
and issued a provisional decision to explain my views.
H said it felt that was a positive outcome. MacDonald said it disagreed with my findings.
MacDonald said that when the damage was found the cause wasnt known. MacDonald said 
the onus for showing an event covered, and not excluded, by the policy had occurred always 
remained with H. And until the leak report was obtained, there was no proof or indeed hint 
of an event subject of the cover having occurred. It later acted to assist H with getting the 
insurer to accept the claim.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I said provisionally:
In short MacDonald should, I think, have notified the insurer of the claim as soon as it was 
intimated to it. The insurer would expect a fair amount of proof to validate the claim but what 
it would want to see or be prepared to accept is really a matter for it to decide  not 
MacDonald (and here it seems the insurer ultimately did not want to see a leak report). But 
in refusing to pass on the claim until it was satisfied it had been proven, MacDonald took on 
the role of the insurer. 
It is absolutely the case that a policyholder will sometimes have to bear costs for validating 
their claim. And theyll certainly have to put in time and effort, cooperating with the 
reasonable requests of the insurer. But most insurers, where evidence, obtained at a cost to 
the policyholder, is submitted which changes the course of a claim, will cover the cost 
incurred. And certainly, where complaints that turn on such issues are made to this service, 
were often of the view, that where key evidence, paid for by a policyholder, is concerned, 
that turns the tide of a claim or complaint, that cost should be reimbursed by the insurer. 
Here MacDonald, acting in the role of the insurer, wanted H to show that the water damage 
had been caused by something the policy covered. And I understand an initial and main 
concern was that maintenance of pipes might have been an issue. So I can understand H 
getting a leak report, and I think its cost was reasonable. The report was crucial in 
evidencing that no leaks had occurred to cause the damage. I think MacDonald reasonably 
needs to reimburse the £702 H paid for this report, plus interest* from the date it was paid for 
until settlement is made. 
Turning to MacDonalds objection to my provisional findings, I dont think it matters that, 
when the claim was notified to it, the claimant didnt know what had caused the damage. The 
claim was notified as one of (potential) flooding, and water damage was in evidence. Thats 
usually enough as a starting point for any insurer to take on and begin considering a claim. 
The insurer might then appoint a loss adjuster or ask for other evidence  but it would be for 
it to choose how it handles things and what it asks for. But MacDonald took on that claim 
handling role here. 
It would also have been for the insurer to show, if it had wanted to, that an exclusion applied 
to prevent the cover from responding to the damage  such as because of a lack of 
maintenance. So its unlikely that the insurer would ever have demanded H obtain a leak 
report in order to satisfy it that an exclusion didnt apply to defeat the claim.
I appreciate that MacDonald may have wanted to assist H by presenting its claim to the 
insurer in the best possible light. Doing so would mean that H would be protected from 
having made a non-valid claim (if the damage reported wasnt fairly covered) and, in theory 
assured Hs best chance of a quick successful claim outcome. But in doing that MacDonald 
was acting to assess and validate the claim. In line with our usual approach in respect of 
complaints against insurers where evidence, which has only come at a price, changes the 
course of the claim and/or complaint, the outlay incurred in gaining that evidence should be 
reimbursed. MacDonald clearly would not have progressed this claim on Hs behalf without 
H, in the first instance, having got the leak report. It follows that I think MacDonald fairly and 
reasonably needs to reimburse H for the cost incurred in obtaining it. 
Having considered MacDonalds reply to my provisional findings, my view on the complaint 
has not changed. My provisional findings, along with my response to MacDonalds reply, 
now form the findings of this, my final decision. 
Putting things right
I require MacDonald to reimburse the £702 H paid for the leak report, plus interest* from the 
date it was paid for until settlement is made. *Interest is at a rate of 8% simple per year and paid on the amounts specified and from/to 
the dates stated. HM Revenue & Customs requires MacDonald to take off tax from this 
interest. It must give H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if it asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. I require MacDonald Group GI LLP to pay the redress set out above 
in putting things right. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask H to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 April 2022.
