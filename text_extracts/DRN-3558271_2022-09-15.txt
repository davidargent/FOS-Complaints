The complaint
Miss M complains that Nationwide Building Society (Nationwide) rejected claim for a refund 
of goods she purchased. She would like a refund of £71.30  the amount overpaid in VAT.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again here 
instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
.
What Ive decided  and why-
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions :-
There is no dispute that Miss M paid VAT twice on an item she purchased. I have 
seen the invoice which, when translated, states a sum of 379 Euros inclusive of VAT. 
I have also seen the delivery note which details a charge of £71.30 for VAT as well 
as confirmation the item was delivered. And there is no dispute that Miss M received 
the goods. So, I do appreciate Miss Ms frustration that she has , in effect, paid the 
VAT charge twice.
Nationwide said it couldnt progress a Chargeback claim as the claim was  for the 
VAT charge  not for goods received. It said  there is no provision under the 
Chargeback rules for this. I have checked the relevant rules and these specifically 
exclude claims for VAT. So , whilst I do appreciate Miss Ms position, Nationwide 
does have to follow the Chargeback Rules. It acted correctly in not pursuing Miss Ms  
claim  it  had no grounds to do so.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2022.
