The complaint
Mr B is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, provided him with credit which he feels
was unaffordable for him at those times.
What happened
In April 2017, Mr B applied for a NewDay administered credit account. His application was
approved, and NewDay issued Mr B with a credit account with an initial credit limit of £600.
In December 2017, NewDay increased the credit limit on Mr Bs account from £600 to
£1,500. Further credit limit increases took place in July and November 2018, and in March
2019, to £3,250, £3,350, and £3,850 respectively.
In 2021, Mr B raised a complaint with NewDay because he felt that none of the provisions of
credit had been affordable for him at those times, and that this should have been apparent to
NewDay, had they undertaken checks into his financial position before approving him for
new or further credit.
NewDay looked at Mr Bs complaint. They confirmed that they had undertaken checks into
Mr Bs financial position before offering credit to him, and they felt that in all instances
thered been nothing resulting from these checks that should have given them any cause to
suspect that Mr B might not be able to afford the credit being offered to him.
Mr B wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that it had been reasonable for
NewDay to have approved Mr Bs application for credit in April 2017, and to have increased
the credit limit on Mr Bs account in December 2017. But our investigator felt NewDay should
reasonably have concluded from the information it assessed in July 2018 that Mr B would
most likely struggle to afford any further credit such that no further credit should have been
offered to him at that time.
NewDay didnt agree with the view of this complaint put forwards by our investigator, so the
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 11 May 2022 as follows:
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how 
much and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before 
approving a customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of 
credit available to a customer on an existing line of credit, the business would 
undertake reasonable and proportionate checks to ensure that any credit being 
offered to a customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
NewDay contend that they did that here, and confirm that they took information about 
his income from Mr B at the point of application to assess whether Mr B would in all 
likelihood be able to afford the payments that might become due on a credit account 
with a £600 credit limit such as he was subsequently approved for.
Additionally, NewDay confirm that they also obtained information about Mr B from a 
credit reference agency to get a better understanding of Mr Bs wider financial 
position at that time. And NewDay believe that there was nothing resulting from any 
of the information that they gathered that they feel should have given them 
reasonable cause to suspect that Mr B might not be able to afford the credit that hed 
applied for.
When considering the information that Mr B gave to NewDay at the point of 
application its notable that he confirmed he was retired with an annual income of 
£13,890. NewDay also assessed Mr Bs total outstanding debt at that time to have 
been £3,800, and based on this information I dont feel that it was unreasonable for 
NewDay to have concluded that Mr B would in all likelihood be able to afford the 
monthly payments that may become due on a credit account with a £600 credit limit.
 
Additionally, the information that NewDay obtained from a credit reference agency 
appeared to show that Mr B was managing his existing credit commitments without 
significant issue, with none of his other accounts in arrears and total exiting debt of 
around £3,800. And while Mr B did have a historical default on his account, that 
default had taken place over two years previously and had been for a relatively low 
amount. As such, Im satisfied that it was reasonable for NewDay, in consideration of 
this information, to have approved Mr B for the new credit account as they did.
Mr B has explained to this service that when he provided his income information to 
NewDay, he included disability payments which he now understands shouldnt have 
been taken into account. I can appreciate Mr Bs position here, but I dont feel it was 
unreasonable for NewDay to have assessed Mr Bs application on the basis of the 
information they were provided with, and given the nature of the information that 
NewDay obtained about Mr B from a credit reference agency at that time, as 
described above, I dont feel that there was any reason for NewDay to have 
challenged the income information that Mr B gave to them, or to have reasonably 
declined his application for credit.
However, Im not convinced that it was reasonable for NewDay to have increased the 
credit limit on Mr Bs account from £600 to £1,500, which NewDay did eight months 
after the opening of the credit account, in December 2017.
I say this because the information that NewDay obtained from a credit reference 
agency at that time confirmed that Mr Bs total existing credit commitments had risen 
from £3,800 at the time of the account application to over £9,300 in the month 
immediately before the credit limit increase.
This is a significant increase in Mr Ms total credit, amounting to over 65% of Mr Bs
previously declared annual income of £13,800, and increasing to nearly 75% if the 
additional £900 credit that NewDay subsequently approved Mr B for is factored in.
This amount of debt doesnt seem sustainable to me, especially when Mr Bs retired 
status is taken into consideration, which meant that it was unlikely that Mr B would 
have been able to increase his income so as to clear his existing debt within a 
reasonable timeframe.Furthermore, while Mr B had generally been managing his NewDay account without
significant incident up to that time, there were a few incidents of Mr B using the 
account to withdraw cash in the months leading up to the credit limit increase, with 
Mr B incurring charges on the account as a result.
Because of the charges that are commonly incurred when cash is withdrawn from a 
credit account, the using of a credit account to obtain cash can be an indicator that 
the account holder is struggling financially and is unable to obtain cash from other 
sources.
And while I dont feel that Mr B withdrawing cash from his credit account in isolation 
should necessarily have been taken as a sign of potential financial difficulty by 
NewDay, I do feel that when considered in conjunction with Mr Bs significantly 
increased total debt and his probable inability as a retired individual to have 
increased his income so as to clear that existing debt in a reasonable timeframe, that 
NewDay should have concluded that the provision of further credit to Mr B in all 
likelihood wouldnt be affordable for him at that time such that the credit limit increase 
from £600 to £1,500 shouldnt have been offered to him.
All of which means that my provisional decision here will be that Ill be upholding this
complaint in Mr Bs favour on the basis that the credit limit that took place in 
December 2017 shouldnt have taken place.
In my provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr B and NewDay the opportunity to provide 
any comments or new information they might wish me to consider before I moved to a final 
decision. 
However, both Mr B and NewDay confirmed that they were happy to accept my provisional 
decision, and so I see no reason not to issue a final decision on that basis. And I can confirm 
that my final decision is that I do uphold this complaint in Mr Bs favour accordingly.
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse to Mr Bs account all charges and fees incurred on the account 
from the point of the credit limit increase in December 2017 onwards.
NewDay must also reimburse all interest accrued on the account on any portion of the
balance over £600 from that same credit limit increase onwards.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance on the account in Mr Bs favour, NewDay
must pay this balance to Mr B along with 8% simple interest calculated to the date of
payment.
If following the above reimbursements there remains a balance outstanding for Mr B to pay,
NewDay must arrange a suitable repayment plan with Mr B, ensuring that no interest is
charged on any part of the balance above £600.
NewDay must also remove all adverse credit file reporting relating to this account from
December 2017 onwards.
Finally, NewDay must make a payment of £200 to Mr B to compensate him for the trouble
and upset this matter has caused. This payment may not be used to reduce the balance on
Mr Bs credit account unless Mr B gives his permission for it to do so.My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua,
on the basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2022.
