K820x#14complaint
Mr Ps unhappy that a cheque he attempted to pay into his Nationwide Building Society 
account was returned unpaid.
background
In May 2017  Mr P withdrew  17 corporate cheques from three  different Nationwide  accounts. 
All were for £5,000  except  one which was for £5,500. All were made payable to him. One 
cheque number ending  #3852 for £5,000 was returned unpaid. As a result Mr P believes he 
is £5,000 short. He wants Nationwide to reimburse  him this sum.
Nationwide said in its final response that cheque  #3852  had been  returned as it was 
replaced by cheque #3853 as there was a cheque printing error. All the cheques he took out, 
including the replacement cheque #3853, with the exception of cheque #3852 had been 
debited from his accounts correctly. The money  on cheque  #3583 had been paid into one of 
Mr Ps accounts. He hadnt  lost £5,000. But it accepted hed received poor service on a 
number of occasions. By way of an apology it had arranged  to transfer £150 into Mr Ps 
current account.
Our investigator felt this complaint  shouldnt be upheld.  He said:
Mr P hasnt  suffered  a £5,000  shortfall  in relation to cheque  #3852 as it was replaced 
by cheque #3853.
Nationwide has said there were problems with cheque #3853  because there wasnt 
enough money in the account it was drawn on to pay it. And as a result it shouldnt 
have been handwritten  and immediately paid into Mr Ps current account.  
The information supplied  shows  Mr P therefore had £5,000  credited to his current 
account when  it shouldnt have been.  And theres no evidence of cheque  #3853 
being debited  from any of Mr Ps accounts.  As there  wasnt any money  left in the 
account it was drawn on, Nationwide needed  to balance the additional £5,000  
credited to Mr Ps current account and it did it so by cancelling cheque #3852. It was 
correct for it to return cheque #3852  unpaid as Mr P had already received the £5,000  
from cheque #3853  in error.  
It was fair for Nationwide to credit Mr Ps current account with £150 for the confusion 
caused.
Mr P doesnt  agree  and has asked for an ombudsman  review. He says Nationwide  hasnt 
been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that cheque #3853 came  out of his ISA 
account. If itd replaced cheque #3582 there  would be an entry in his ISA passbook showing 
a correction. And there isnt. So cheque #3852 hasnt been  replaced. He says he transferred 
£5,000 into his current account  from another  to allow cheque #3583 to be drawn from his 
current account. But as it was handwritten it wasnt of use to him and was paid into his 
current account. He says Nationwide has changed the statement after it refused to honour 
cheque #3852. Once an account has been  closed  then it isnt logically possible to withdraw  a 
cheque out of the closed  account.
Ref: DRN15310202my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Some of the evidence in this case is incomplete,  inconclusive or contradictory. So, Ive made 
my decision  based  on what I think is more likely to have happened  than not. 
I can understand why Mr P has become confused  over whats  happened.  And as he says it 
isnt logically possible for a cheque to be withdrawn from a closed account. 
Mr P has said that cheque #3853 came  from his current  account ending in #3357 not his ISA 
account as Nationwide has said. But the statement for account ending #3357  shows  that 
only three cheques  were issued from it on 17 May 2017 and none of them  was cheque 
number #3853.
Cheque #3852 was issued that same  day from Mr Ps ISA account along with four other 
cheques. One of those four cheques was issued, cancelled and the transaction corrected. At 
the start of the transactions the ISA account had a balance of £20,000 and the four cheques 
issued were each  for £5,000. The closing interest on the account  was then paid out and the 
account closed  as it had no more money in it.
Even so it appears Nationwide  then issued cheque #3583 to Mr P but it says it didnt  actually 
debit this money from his ISA or any account.  And I think thats why this withdrawal isnt 
shown on Mr Ps ISA passbook. There was a problem printing this cheque.  The branch staff 
thought this was merely a printer problem and its also described it as a keying error. But in 
fact this printing  problem  was recognition that it was attempting to issue  the cheque from his 
ISA account which didnt have any money in it after the previous four cheques  had been 
issued and the account closed. 
Despite this the branch staff then provided  Mr P with a handwritten cheque for £5,000 
without debiting this amount from any of his accounts. Mr P said he couldnt use the 
handwritten cheque. He says he was then told cheque #3853 would be put back into his 
current account and the cheque was torn up and put in the bin. 
Mr Ps current account statement shows a cheque deposit on 17 May 2017 for £5,000 
which I think on balance is the money  from cheque #3853.
At this point Mr P had in effect received  £5,000 from Nationwide  that hadnt been  debited 
from any of his accounts and wasnt his. So, Nationwide reasonably determined to take 
steps to recover this overpayment and it did so by refusing to pay one of the previously 
issued cheques on the ISA account  cheque #3852. 
In effect it replaced  cheque #3852 with handwritten cheque  #3583.  And the £5,000  hed 
withdrawn from his ISA ended up in his current account.
The net result of all this is that £20,000 has been debited from Mr Ps ISA account  as he 
intended and that sum has been  paid out by Nationwide honouring three  of the £5,000  
cheques drawn  on that account and paying £5,000 into Mr Ps current  account  in respect of 
handwritten cheque #3583.
Ref: DRN15310203Consequently I think on balance that neither Mr P nor Nationwide are out of pocket. And I 
dont think I can therefore fairly or reasonably require Nationwide to pay Mr P another £5,000  
as hed like. 
Mr P has clearly  been caused distress and inconvenience by Nationwides error and 
handling of matters. Its already paid him £150 compensation into his current account  for 
this. Taking everything  into account, including the level of awards we make, I think  thats fair. 
And I dont  think I can reasonably ask it to pay him anymore.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2019.
