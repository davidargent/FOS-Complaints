The complaint
Mr M complains that Metro Bank PLC trading as RateSetter have made an error when 
calculating his loan settlement.
What happened
In February 2021, Mr M took out a 5-year loan for £6800 with RateSetter for which he was to 
pay a monthly direct debit of £121.61. These payments were to be made at the beginning of 
each month starting in March 2021.
On 27 April 2022, Mr M went on-line to request a loan settlement figure and by processing a 
payment for £2418.02 he thought he had paid the loan off in full.
On 3 May 2022, Mr M was surprised to see that RateSetter deducted another monthly 
payment of £121.61. So, thinking this was an error Mr M arranged for this to be reversed. 
However, Mr M was shocked to subsequently get a default notice as RateSetter says that he 
owes this amount. They informed Mr M that the payment due at the beginning of May 2022 
was deliberately excluded from the redemption figure. They explained their system was 
designed this way to avoid any duplication of payments and Mr M owes this amount.
As Mr M disputes this, a default marker has been placed on his credit file and the debt 
passed to debt collectors.
Mr M complained to RateSetter, but they insist that this amount is owed. They have however 
said that when Mr M pays this amount, they will ensure no adverse data will be reported on 
his credit file.
Mr M complained to our service; however, our investigator is satisfied that Mr M owes this 
amount.
As Mr M remains dissatisfied this case has now been referred to me to look at.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I first looked at Mr Ms loan agreement and the following from section 2.6 confirmed the 
payment wouldnt, because of the bank holiday weekend, be credited until 3 May which was 
the day the monthly direct debit was due:
Any payment made otherwise than by Direct Debit or which is different from your
normal contractual amount (for example, if you make an extra payment or if you
pay off your loan early) will be credited to your loan two working days following
the date it is received and/or identified (the Settlement Date).
I then analysed the screenshot of Mr Ms £2418.02 payment together with Mr Ms statement 
and found that they confirmed what RateSetter had said  that their system was designed 
not to take the next direct debit due and, by reversing the direct debit, Mr M owed them 
£121.61.
The screenshot said:
Making this payment will not impact the amount or date of your next scheduled payment.
And I found this screenshot to be consistent with RateSetters logical explanation and the 
loan statement. 
The loan statement shows that the loan started on 1 February 2021, Mr Ms first monthly 
payment of £121.61 was on 1 March 2021 and his last monthly payment of £121.61 was on 
1 April 2022. So, Mr M made 14 monthly payments for a 15-month loan period and, contrary 
to what Mr M believes, his action of reversing the 3 May 2022 direct debit instruction meant 
he inadvertently failed to settle his loan and contravened the loan agreement. This is 
because the payment of £2418.02 was insufficient as RateSetter had factored in the May 
2022 direct debit payment being made. 
For clarity purposes, I have put together the following summary table which should be 
viewed alongside RateSetters loan statement. This illustrates that the £2418.02 figure was 
calculated together with 15 rather than 14 payments of £121.61, so the 3 May 2022 payment 
shouldnt have been reversed.

* See statement - 15 payments required as loan started on 1/2/21 and ended 3/5/22 
I can see why Mr M didnt realise a final direct debit payment. This is because he thought he 
was paying in full. But Im satisfied the May 2022 direct debit was required as per 
RateSetters screenshot and statement, so RateSetters correspondence, collection, default, 
termination and debt collection agency actions werent errors. Also, I found RateSetters 
actions to be in accordance with section 3.2 of the loan agreement Mr M electronically 
signed.
Regarding Mr Ms credit file, considering the circumstances here Im pleased to see that 
RateSetter are willing to exercise discretion should Mr M decide to pay the £121.61 still 
outstanding.
So, considering all the above Im not upholding this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 March 2023.
