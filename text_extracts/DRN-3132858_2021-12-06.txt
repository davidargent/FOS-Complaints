The complaint
Mr M complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has locked him out of his account. He 
said he was very concerned about this, because his account was linked to his bank account. 
He just wanted PayPal to close his account for him.
What happened
When Mr M first got in touch, PayPal said Mr Ms account wasnt locked or frozen, he just 
wasnt able to get into it. PayPal said it had tried to contact him to resolve this, but it hadnt 
been able to speak to him. PayPal asked Mr M to call, so it could resolve this for him.
Mr M told us that when he was trying to log in, the log in process told him that PayPal would 
send a passcode to his phone number. Mr M said PayPal only had his old mobile number, 
and he didnt want to give it the new one, so this wouldnt allow him to access the account. 
PayPal said Mr M did have other options to get into his account. It said Mr M could call 
PayPal. He would need to have his bank account number to hand. He could then validate 
the account and PayPal could update his details for him. 
PayPal said that another option was for Mr M to provide proof of ID and ownership of the 
account such as bank statement. Then PayPal could close the account, which would allow 
Mr M to create a new one if he wanted to. 
Mr M said he tried calling PayPal, but it took too long to answer the phone. He just wanted 
PayPal to close his account.
PayPal said it wouldnt close his account for him, unless it could confirm that this really was 
his account. So it needed ID from him. But Mr M said he wouldnt send photocopies of his 
personal ID in an email, he didnt think that was safe. Mr M still felt PayPal should just close 
his account. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. She said PayPal had removed 
the dormant tag which was previously on Mr Ms account, which shouldve helped him to 
access the account. And it had offered other ways forward for him to get back into the 
account. But PayPal wouldnt just close the account, because it says that to comply with new 
law, there needs to be two factor authentication on his account. 
Our investigator said that shed reviewed what PayPal had said, against the user agreement 
that it had with Mr M. That agreement said that Mr M would keep his phone number current. 
It also explained that European law required it to identify Mr M through two separate means 
when hes doing things like changing the account setup. 
Our investigator said PayPal was acting in line with this user agreement. It didnt have an up 
to date number, and Mr M didnt want to provide ID. She said that whilst she understood Mr 
M might find it inconvenient to have to call customer service, she said that wasnt an 
unreasonable requirement in the interests of maintaining account security. Our investigator 
didnt think PayPal had to do any more. 
Mr M didnt agree. He said most of PayPals current policies didnt exist when he opened the 
account, and certainly not the underlying law which our investigator and PayPal referred to. 
Mr M said he would have no problem calling PayPal if it had staff to answer the phone. But 
he had no desire to repeatedly sit on hold, not knowing if he will ever get an answer.
Mr M said he wouldnt give PayPal his personal data, and he thought PayPal was breaking 
the law by refusing to close his account. Mr M then got in touch again, to say that money had 
been taken out of his bank account by PayPal. He said he was furious.
PayPal said this issue about money being taken from his account was a new complaint, 
which Mr M would need to allow it to consider before our service could look into things for 
him. And PayPal said it couldnt fix this for Mr M without more information from him about 
what had happened. But in the meantime, it placed a limitation on his account, to stop any 
payments being made. 
Our investigator said she appreciated that the position had changed since Mr M opened this 
account, but banks do need to comply with the new laws. She didnt think that PayPal was 
wrong to have these security measures in place.
Our investigator said PayPal had offered another option. Mr M could call, and PayPal could 
then get access to information from Mr Ms credit file, which it could use to help identify him. 
Our investigator said this service cant just ask PayPal to close Mr Ms account, because its 
reasonable for PayPal to follow its own rules and legal guidance. She still didnt think PayPal 
had to do any more. 
Mr M said hed never given PayPal the details of the card it had taken money from. He said 
he had tried to call, but had been left on hold for 20-30 minutes with no answer. Mr M said 
that PayPal didnt have any personal information about him so he didnt think it could use 
that to prove who he was. He thought it must have breached data protection requirements if 
it did have this information. He wanted PayPal to explain exactly what it proposed. 
Mr M said he was no nearer a resolution, and he was very disappointed in our service. 
Because no agreement was reached, this case was passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. 
I understand that Mr M would now like his account with PayPal to be closed. PayPal is 
happy to do this for Mr M, but it says that it does need to be sure that its dealing with him. 
PayPal has explained the changes in the law which have happened since Mr M first opened 
this account, and said it does comply with those requirements. I dont think thats an 
unreasonable approach for PayPal to take, and I note that this is in line with its user 
agreement. Like our investigator, I dont think it would be reasonable for our service to just 
tell PayPal to close this account. PayPal has given Mr M options to close his account. I understand Mr M doesnt want to give 
PayPal any more personal data, and he particularly doesnt want to send ID by email. But he 
doesnt have to do either of those things. If Mr M rings and speaks to PayPal, it will be able 
to identify him either using what it already knows about him, from his account, or it can 
identify him using information which is provided to it for that purpose, by a credit reference 
agency. I dont think that either of these options constitute a breach of data protection law.
Mr M has said that this isnt acceptable either, because he cant get through to anyone. He 
says hes tried multiple times, and been left on hold for 20 or 30 minutes. 
Although I accept this is inconvenient for Mr M, I dont think PayPal ought to waive its 
security requirements because of this. I understand why speaking to someone is the only 
option Mr M would wish to take for closing his account, but PayPal has offered to do this 
process online too. And businesses do continue to be affected by the pandemic, so I dont 
think I can say its unreasonable for PayPal to have long on hold times. 
I know that Mr M will be disappointed, but I dont think that PayPal is being unreasonable or 
unfair. And that means I dont think this complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2022.
