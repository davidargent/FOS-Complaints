The complaint
Miss P complains that Oakam Ltd lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on 29 September 2020. Both parties have responded and 
neither has anything further to add. So, the reply date having passed, and having received 
responses from both Miss A and Oakam, I am proceeding to the final decision.
Using information from both parties I have drawn up a table to show the lending. This table is
not as accurate as I would have liked it to be as the first few cheque style loans have been
pieced together from a bit of information from Oakam and more detailed information from
Miss A. She sent to us a copy of the 17 September 2009 credit agreement, some of the
clauses of which I refer to later.
In relation to the Bonus Loans (Loan 4 onwards) the credit agreements, repayment
schedules and statements of account each have different figures for each loan. This means
that the figures do not correlate and have been difficult to match up. So, I have chosen to
use the credit agreement figures and the repayment schedules to create the table.

Loans 1, 1a and 1b were cheque style advances of cash whereby Miss A would write a
cheque for the amount she wished to borrow, hand over the cheque in return for which she
would receive cash. Oakam has described these as payday loans. 
The 17 September 2009 credit agreement gives some detail - the credit limit for Miss A was 
set at £200 and Miss A was entitled to receive advances if the total value outstanding to 
us is less than the credit limit above.  this is clause 4. This is a clause I refer to later in my 
decision.
Miss A was given the option each month to extend her payment date or for Oakam to bank
the cheque. Miss A has explained to us that she never had enough in her account for a £100
cheque (or two £100 pound cheques) to be banked and so each month a fresh charge was
applied. The charges were usually £22 and are shown in this statement of account provided
by Oakam. There was an initial registration fee for new customers*.

Miss A disputed Oakams records of these earlier cheque style loans and had documentary
evidence which suggested she did write out additional cheques on 22 December 2009 and
20 April 2010 and that these were also renewed or rolled. Miss A suggested she received 
additional capital. Oakam did not accept this but equally cannot furnish us with any further 
details about those earlier loans. 
So, theres a dispute between the parties about exactly what and when Miss A borrowed 
between September 2009 and 12 July 2010. I come to some findings about these earlier 
loans in the main body of the decision.
According to Oakams records (duplicated above), on 12 July 2010 Miss A received a further
£400 cash advanced against the security of further cheques. She still owed £400 from the 
earlier payday loans and so the total was £800 principal money owed to Oakam.
On 20 July 2010 Oakam seems to have had a new system and from the information I have
been given, Miss A appears to have agreed for the £800 payday loans to be repaid by
restructuring that debt into a new twelve month credit agreement, repayable in weekly
instalments. The 20 July 2010 date  shown above as the date the cheque style loans were
all repaid - was the date that Miss A was approved for Loan 4.One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint in April 2020 and thought that Oakam should 
put things right for Miss A from the fourth renewing or rollover of Loan 1 which I take to 
mean 20 January 2010 although the adjudicator did not cite the date. That uphold opinion by 
our adjudicator included all the loans that followed. And from Loan 6 the adjudicator thought 
that Miss A was reliant on the credit and so all lending ought to have ceased. So Oakam 
should put things right for her from that date too.
I have decided to keep to the original numbering of the loans and I am unclear why they 
were altered by the adjudicator after issuing a letter of opinion in April 2020.
Miss A responded but only in relation to the misunderstanding of the earlier loans. And 
Oakam has made many submissions and asked that the complaint be passed to an
ombudsman.
Oakams submissions after the adjudicators view are summarised and paraphrased (in
places) here:
loans 4 to 6 were amortising instalment loans;
Oakam would have assessed Miss As ability to meet the instalments;
refinancing took place when the customer was a good payer and the balances of an
existing loan had been suitably paid down;
individualised affordability checks were carried out for each loan including interviews;
loans were approved having checked that they were affordable and sustainable;
Oakam cited several sections of the Office of Fair Trading Irresponsible Lending
Guide (OFT ILG);
Miss As payment history demonstrated to it that she could pay without undue 
difficulty  she did have 8 late payments in one year which Oakam says did not 
cause it concern;
partial credit searches were carried out before each of the loans from 20 July 2010;
Oakam got some of Miss As bank statements to validate her income and
expenditure (I&E)  these were for 20 July 2010 and 13 May 2011;
her debt to income ratio was 12 to 14%;
Oakams core mission is to provide reasonable access to affordable credit;
Oakam did borrower-focussed assessments;
after doing an I&E then a haircut of at least 50% was applied;
our low-and-grow product proposition where we typically grant customers low 
amounts over a short term and then graduate good paying customers to larger lines 
at cheaper rates.;
Individual Voluntary Arrangement, bankruptcy and Debt Relief Order checks done.
Oakam concluded:
Based on the above, our assessment is that our underwriting practices were
compliant in that we adhered to the relevant rules and guidelines specified by the
regulator at the time these loans were provided. Further to this, we believe we
provided borrower-focussed assessments that were designed to place [Miss A] on
affordable and sustainable loan products.
Later Oakam has also asked for lots of information from us to better understand the
decision and has invited the ombudsman to go into detail.
The complaint remained unresolved and was passed to me for a decision. And I said earlier, 
this final decision follows the provisional decision.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. No additional 
evidence or points from either party has led me to issue a final decision in the same terms as 
the provisional decision and for the same reasons which I set out here. 
Preliminary point
In Oakams final response letter (FRL) it addressed the loans from 20 July 2010 onwards
(nothing before that) and it said that it was not able to uphold Miss As complaint. Its reasons
were because it considered that the complaint had been raised outside what it described as
the eligibility rules stemming from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) DISP rules and
particularly DISP 2.8.2. Oakams submissions to this service in September 2019, after
Miss A had referred her complaint to us, repeated this line of argument.
When I issued my provisional decision on 29 September 2020, I said that it was unclear 
whether this had been addressed for Oakam prior to the adjudicators view in April 2020. 
This complaint had been referred to me to address the merits of the complaint, not the 
jurisdiction element. I did point out in my provisional decision that since September 2019 
Oakam never repeated the line of argument and had responded positively to all the requests 
for additional information our adjudicator had asked over the year. And after the adjudicators 
view was received, its extensive set of submissions made no reference to the jurisdiction 
DISP 2.8.2 element. And since it has received my provisional decision, this has not been 
raised. So, I deduce that Oakam has no issue with this point. I am proceeding on the merits 
of the complaint.
Main complaint issues
Oakam said (and this is not the first time) that it wished to better understand our approach
to these loans and this lending. On that point I refer Oakam to our website where several
lead decisions detailing the regulations culminating in our approach have been published. In
relation to any specific points made by Oakam about the complaint brought by Miss A, then
I address them in my decision.
Oakam needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss A
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much was being lent, the
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Oakam should fairly and reasonably have done
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.
These factors include: where a customers income is particularly low; where the repayments
are particularly high; and/or where the frequency of the loans and the length of time over
which a customer has been given loans need to be looked at: repeated refinancing could
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable. There may even 
come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.Oakam was required to establish whether Miss A could sustainably repay her loans  not
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case.
This is because the Office of Fair Trading Irresponsible Lending Guide (OFT ILG) defined
sustainable as being the ability to repay without undue difficulties. The precursor was the
2008 document by the OFT labelled OFT969, which was similar. The customer should be
able to make repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments, and
without having to borrow to meet the repayments.
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further
in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all means for Miss As complaint. Oakam has cited many parts of the
ILG to us and so I appreciate that it is familiar with the Guide.
Cheque advances or payday loans
I am proceeding on the basis that the combined capital sum taken with these types of loans
was £800. I appreciate that Miss A disputed the amount but I must move this complaint
along  for the interests of both parties  and Oakam has no more to give us and Miss A has
sent to me what she has. And no additional points have been raised since I issued my 
provisional decision on 29 September 2020. 
It is feasible that Miss A had more loans in 2009 and 2010 but its not clear based on the 
evidence that has been provided to me. 
A term in the 17 September 2009 credit agreement does say that updated replacement 
cheques mustbe provided every three months. So, this may go towards explaining the 
multiple cheque numbers which Miss A has been explaining to us. And it may also explain 
why she has some of the original cheques in her possession  they may have been returned 
once replacements were sent.
During this cheque loan period, the charges Miss A paid to Oakam added up to be £204.50
for a £200 loan from September 2009 to April 2010. Oakam would have been aware that she
had rolled over the loan many times. No principal had been paid down during that time.
Oakams records showed that Miss A was advanced another £200 on 30 April 2010 despite
this continuous rollover which took place for many months. 
And I have thought about whether this advance was in breach of clause 4 of the 
17 September 2009 credit agreement to which I referred earlier. That credit agreement, 
clause 4, said that the credit limit for Miss A was set at £200 and Miss A was entitled to 
receive advances if the total value outstanding to us is less than the credit limit above..
And having thought about it I do find that was likely a breach of clause 4. 
A further £132 was paid by Miss A in fees and yet still no capital was paid down. In 
July 2010 Oakam advanced to Miss A double the amount which was outstanding. So, her 
balance became £800. Again, I think that this may have been a breach of clause 4. But in
any event, I think this is contrary to good practice at the time. The ILG at paragraph 6:25
stated this could be viewed as unfair practice: Repeatedly refinancing (or 'rolling over') aborrower's existing credit commitment for a short-term credit product in a way that is
unsustainable or otherwise harmful. I see that the 17 September 2009 agreement allowed
for up to 11 rollovers on a loan (clause 5).
Oakam has said it does not have much information relating to the application process and
what was done or presented by the parties before these loans were approved. But it has
provided copies of bank statements for August 2009 (before Loan 1), February and
April 2010 (before Loan 1a). These are not complete sets of bank statements  they are the 
first pages only.
Oakam seems to be saying that it had carried out satisfactory checks and as such
considered that Miss A was able to be advanced the money secured against these cheques
for these dates. But I disagree. What these limited copies of bank statements show is that
Miss As monthly salary was low at £620, that she had at least one dependant in that she
received child benefit and tax credits, that she already had a regular payment to a debt
recovery company and had several other credit commitments as well.
So, I think Oakam was on notice from the beginning that Miss A had credit issues and other 
credit commitments and had a low salary. And by the time the first set of payday (cheque) 
loans had been rolled four times then it ought to have been gathering more in-depth 
information about Miss As finances. I have not seen evidence of anything further than 
another partial bank statement for February and April 2010. So, I do not think that Oakam 
should have continued to lend from that fourth rollover which was 20 January 2010, and 
I think that Oakam should put things right for Miss A from that date.
Bonus rewards loans
All this debt (£800) was restructured into a loan agreement on 20 July 2010 for twelve 
months to be repaid by weekly cash payments from that date.
The application for Loan 4 reveals that it was to cover the existing debt and is badged on the
Underwriters Justification Notes as a payday loan conversion. So, this seems to have been
carried out to move Miss A from the cheque loan type loans to this new Bonus Loan 
agreement. And it includes information which simply does not dovetail with the information
Oakam already had on its files being the front pages of three sets of bank statements
(referred to earlier).
That application suggests that Miss A had no arrears and no credit card whereas her bank
statements show she had other credit to repay and had a debt recovery commitment as well,
which suggests she was in arrears with another account. Added to which she had been 
rolling her payday loans with Oakam for ten months by that stage of the lending relationship, 
which certainly suggests difficulty to pay. And Miss A had not been making any inroads into 
the debt.
The underwriters notes say, no call credit necessary. I can see that there were no results
for the credit check, so I do not think that a credit search was done. Miss A was charged a
combined administration fee of £90 which was added to the credit (the formal signed credit
agreement was for £890) and so interest was charged on the administration fees.
The disbursement made in store to Miss A was ostensibly £800, but as her previous payday
loan balance reduced to £0 on 20 July 2010 then I do not think that Miss A received any
further cash that day. Especially as she has told us that she received £400 against the four
fresh cheques she had just written out a week earlier on 12 July 2020.
If I am wrong on this aspect, and I do not think I am, then to lend to Miss A a further £800 onthis new agreement after lending £400 to her just a few days earlier, and knowing Miss As
repayment history (many months of rolling the cheque style payday loans over) then I would
have expected at least a full financial review to have been carried out before lending. And
yet Oakams own notes state no call credit necessary. And so, I do not think one was 
carried out.
The total due to be repaid on the new loan was £1,668 (using the repayment schedule for
these figures as I outlined in the background section of this decision). Her indebtedness
was extended for a further 12 months until July 2011. The income and expenditure
calculation on that form resulted in Miss As net disposable income as being £1,106. And
I  think that a proper creditworthiness assessment from the borrowers perspective, which
is what the OFT ILG required, would have led an underwriter to question whether those
figures were correct.
I say this because it seems a high disposable income figure and I have been given Miss As 
bank statements for May 2010. Those show me that by this time Miss A had the same debt
recovery regular payment she had before, plus she was paying £1 to a utility company and
was paying money to a separate business which related to a Debt Management Plan
(DMP). She was paying for a credit card and her income was being supplemented with tax
credits and child benefit payments.
All these factors lead me to think that the assessment was not carried out in a
comprehensive manner and Oakam ought to have done more. Because if it had it would
have realised that it was irresponsible to lend these sorts of sums to Miss A at that time.
Miss A went from having paid about £330 in charges over ten months for the payday loan
advances without any reduction in the principal amount owed, and then was charged
additional interest going forward to cover that debt for a further 12 months. My view is that a
repayment plan ought to have been put in place in July 2010 and not a fresh set of lending.
Five months into this loan, in December 2010, a further loan was approved for her,
absorbing the outstanding amount on Loan 4 into the new Loan 5. The statement of account
for Loan 4 shows that the £702 (rounded figure) outstanding which was absorbed into
Loan 5 included interest as well as capital. This meant that Miss A was being charged
interest on sums already containing an interest element.
Loan 5 also gave Miss A additional cash of £413 described as a top-up. The amount to pay
over the year was calculated to be £2,198 including the new administration fee.
The application form for Loan 5 had the same information and income and expenditure
figures on it as I have outlined for Loan 4.
Oakam has provided for us a copy of a low level call credit check from December 2010
which looks more like a verification check than any sort of serious credit search. I appreciate
that credit searches are not required before a lending decision was made but in view of the 
length of time that Oakam had been lending to Miss A by this point and that her amounts
were increasing, the indebtedness was extending and interest was being charged on top of
interest, then I would have expected a full financial review to have taken place. I dont this
took place.
Oakam needs to put things right for Miss A from the 20 January 2010 to the Loan 5 
approval.
I have also looked at the overall pattern of Oakams lending history with Miss A, with a view
to seeing if there was a point at which Oakam should reasonably have seen that furtherlending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Oakam should have realised that it
shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the circumstances of Miss As case, I think that this point was reached by Loan 6.
I say this because:
Loan 6 was approved in May 2011. Miss A had not been paying down Loan 5 for
very long and the new loan was for £1,396 being £865 from Loan 5 plus new cash of
£466.00. This was 17 months into the overall lending relationship. Already Loan 6
would have been the third refinancing and charging of interest on top of interest,
which followed 14 rollovers of the cheque style loans in 2009 and 2010;
From Loan 6 onwards Miss A was provided with a new loan at the same time she
settled a previous one. Each loan was refinanced into the next around 5 or 6 months
into the agreement. So Oakam ought to have realised it was more likely than not
Miss A was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was
leaving in her finances and that Miss As indebtedness was increasing unsustainably;
Miss A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Oakam. Loan 9 was
taken out three years after Miss As first. And it was for a larger amount. Miss A had
paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Oakam over an extended
period.
I think that Miss A lost out because Oakam continued to provide borrowing from Loan 6
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss As indebtedness by allowing
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period and 
the sheer number of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications
on Miss As ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
As well concluding that Oakam needs to put things right for Miss A from the 20 January 2010 
through to (and including) the Loan 5 approval, I uphold Miss As complaint about Loans 6 to 
9 and I direct that Oakam should put things right for these loans as well.
Putting things right
Oakam should 
refund all interest and charges Miss A paid from 20 January 2010 in relation to the 
cheque loans and all interest and charges for Loans 4 to 9;
Oakam should pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges 
from the date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 6 to 9 should be removed from 
Miss As credit file.
If Miss A still owes Oakam the principal balance she borrowed on her final loan (Loan 9),
instead of the above directions for this loan, Oakam should remove all the interest and 
charges applied to the outstanding balance. Oakam should then re-work the account as if all 
payments made by Miss A went to towards the principal. But importantly, Oakam needs to 
make sure that Miss A doesnt repay more than the principal amount borrowed.If after doing this Miss A hasnt repaid the principal she borrowed, Oakam can deduct this
from the remainder of the redress figure. If, Miss A has already paid enough to repay the
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to her with 8% simple* interest from the
date of payment to the date of settlement.
And if Oakam no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the amount
owed, then it should buy it back. If it doesnt then it isnt entitled to make any deductions for it
from the amount it needs to pay Miss A.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Oakam to take off tax from this interest. Oakam must
give Miss A a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Miss As complaint in part and direct that Oakam Ltd does 
as I have set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 November 2020.
