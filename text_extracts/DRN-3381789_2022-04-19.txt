The complaint
Mr P is unhappy that NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, approved him for increasing amounts of
credit, all of which he feels were unaffordable for him at those times.
What happened
Mr P had a NewDay credit account with a credit limit of £600. In August 2016, NewDay
increased the credit limit on Mr Ps account from £600 to £1,350. Further credit limit
increases followed in March and August 2018, to £2,150 and £3,150 respectively. Mr P
requested another credit limit increase in April 2019, but NewDay declined that request.
In January 2020, Mr P applied for a different NewDay branded credit account. Mr Ps
application was approved, and NewDay issued Mr P with a new credit account with a £900
credit limit. In October 2020, NewDay increased the credit limit on this second credit account
to £1,900.
In March 2021, Mr P raised a complaint with NewDay on the basis that he felt that all the
provisions of credit from august 2016 onwards hadnt been affordable for him at those times.
Mr P also stated that NewDay should have been aware that he was making large numbers
of gambling transactions during the period in question, which should have provided
additional cause for NewDay not to have given him any further credit.
NewDay looked at Mr Ps complaint. They noted that before offering further credit to Mr P,
that theyd undertaken checks into Mr Ps financial position, and that thered been nothing
resulting from those checks that NewDay felt should have given them cause to suspect that
Mr P might not be able to afford the credit being offered to him. Additionally, NewDay noted
that Mr P hadnt made them aware of any financial difficulty that he might have been in, or
that he might have been struggling with issues surrounding gambling, and as such they
hadnt been aware that Mr P was in a position of difficulty at any time.
Mr P wasnt satisfied with NewDays response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that the information that NewDay
had available to them should have given them reason to consider that Mr P might be
experiencing financial difficulty, such that the provision of further credit in August 2016, and
all subsequent provisions of credit, shouldnt have been provided to him. Our investigator
therefore recommended that this complaint be upheld in Mr Ps favour on that basis.
NewDay didnt agree with the recommendation put forwards by our investigator, so the
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 17 February 2022 as follows:
Its for a business to decide whether it will offer credit to a customer, and if so, how
much and on what terms. What this service would expect would be, that before
approving a customer for a new line of credit, or before increasing the amount of
credit available to a customer on an existing line of credit, the business would
undertake reasonable and proportionate checks to ensure that any credit being
offered to a customer is affordable for that customer at that time.
NewDay say that they did that here, and note that before offering further credit to Mr
P they reviewed how he managed his credit account to that time and obtained
information from a credit reference agency to gain a better understanding of Mr Ps
wider financial position. And NewDay maintain that, in all instances, there was
nothing resulting from these checks that should have given them cause to suspect
that Mr P might not be able to afford the further credit being offered to him.
However, its notable that for the two months immediately prior to the first credit limit
increase in August 2016, Mr P hadnt maintained the balance of his credit account
within the agreed credit limit of £600 that was in place at that time, and had incurred
over-limit fees on the account in both instances as a result.
And, while the information that NewDay obtained from a credit reference agency
didnt suggest that Mr P was struggling with his other credit commitments at that
time, its also notable that Mr Ps amount of existing credit had increased
significantly, from approximately £2,250 to £4,200, the month before NewDay
approved him for further credit on his NewDay account.
Considering this information  that Mr Ps total amount of existing external credit had
recently doubled and that Mr P was struggling to maintain the balance of his NewDay
account within the agreed credit limit and was incurring fees as a result  I find it
difficult to reach any conclusion other than NewDay should have had concerns about
Mr Ps ability to be able to afford and repay any provision of further credit, given that
it appeared apparent that Mr P was struggling to afford the existing amount of credit
he had with NewDay at that time.
I therefore feel that it was incumbent on NewDay, if they wished to provide further
credit to Mr P, to have undertaken further checks into Mr Ps financial position before
doing so, to ensure that any provision of further credit wouldnt lead to an
exacerbation of any potential financial difficulties that Mr P might have been
experiencing.
Furthermore, it seems reasonable to me that any further checks that NewDay may
have undertaken on this basis should have included a review of Mr Ps current
account statements. And its clear from the current account statements that Mr P has
provided from this period that Mr P was engaging in large numbers of gambling
transactions such that any review of these statements by NewDay could only have
reasonably led to their concluding that any further provisions of credit to Mr P at that
time would have led to a worsening of the difficult financial position that Mr P
appeared to be in, and so shouldnt have been offered.
As such, Im satisfied based on the information detailed above that by providing Mr P
with further credit in August 2016, NewDay were providing credit to Mr P
irresponsibly, and I will be provisionally upholding this complaint in Mr Ps favour on
that basis.
It follows that I feel that all future provisions of credit on this account also shouldnt
have been offered to Mr P, and I note that Mr Ps continuing financial struggles
appear to be evidenced by his exceeding the credit limit on this account in ten of thefollowing nineteen months, and incurring over-limit fees on all occasions as a result.
It's notable that NewDay themselves did decline Mr P for further credit on this
account in April 2019, but that they then approved Mr P for a new, differently branded
credit account in January 2020. However, its also notable that in the months leading
up to this new account application, Mr Ps management of his existing NewDay credit
had improved, with Mr P maintaining the balance of the account within the credit limit
and not incurring any over-limit fees during that time.
Additionally, the information that NewDay gathered from Mr P at the time of the new
application, including that Mr P was employed with an annual income of £27,500, as
well as the information that NewDay obtained from a credit reference agency, which
included that Mr P wasnt in arrears on any of his existing credit commitments, wasnt
suggestive that Mr P might be in any form of financial difficulty at that time. As such,
Im satisfied that it was reasonable for NewDay to conclude that Mr P would most
likely be able to afford this second credit account and that NewDay didnt act unfairly
towards Mr P by providing him with the second credit account with an initial credit
limit of £900.
Furthermore, in the months leading up to the credit limit increase on this second
account, from £900 to £1,900, which took place in October 2020, Mr Ps
management of both of his older and newer NewDay credit accounts continued to
appear unproblematic, with Mr P maintaining the balance of both accounts within the
agreed credit limits and not incurring any over-limit fees on either account.
And, while the information that NewDay obtained from a credit reference agency did
show that Mr Ps total amount of existing credit had increased since the time that he
opened the second credit account, it also showed that Mr P wasnt in arrears on any
of his other credit commitments and appeared to be managing those commitments
without notable issue.
As such, I dont feel that there was compelling indication that Mr P might have been
struggling to manage his financial position at the time of this credit limit increase such
that NewDay shouldnt have provided the further credit to him that they did.
All of which means that while I do feel that the indicators of potential financial
difficulty that were present when NewDay offered further credit to Mr P on his first
credit account were such that NewDay shouldnt have offered that further credit, Im
satisfied that NewDay didnt act unfairly by approving Mr Ps application for his
second credit account, or by later offering Mr P further credit on that second account,
given that I feel that the indicators of potential financial difficulty that should have
influenced NewDay in regard to the first credit account were no longer present at
those times.
My provisional decision will therefore be that I uphold this complaint in Mr Ps favour
in respect of the provisions of further credit on the first credit account only.
As a result, my provisional instructions are that NewDay must reimburse to Mr Ps
first credit account all fees and charges incurred on the account from the point of the
credit limit increase in August 2016 onwards, as well as reimburse all interest
accrued on the account relating to the balance of the account above £600 from that
same point onwards.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance in Mr Ps favour, NewDay must pay
this balance to Mr P along with 8% interest calculated to the date of payment.
NewDay must also make a further payment of £200 to Mr P to compensate him forthe upset and inconvenience this ongoing matter has caused, which given the difficult
circumstances Mr P was in at the time of the provisions of further credit I
acknowledge were incurred.
However, as mentioned, I am not provisionally upholding Mr Ps complaint as it
relates to the second NewDay account and so there are no instructions to NewDay in
relation to that account.
In response to my provisional decision letter, both NewDay and Mr P provided further 
comments for me to consider. This led to me issuing a second provisional decision letter on 
17 March 2022 as follows:
NewDay didnt agree with my provisional decision and said that the while it was 
correct that Mr P had exceeded the credit limit on his account in the months 
immediately preceding the credit limit increase in August 2016, the reason that Mr P 
had exceeded the credit limit on those occasions was because Mr P had mis-
managed the account, rather than as a result of Mr P being unable to afford the 
payments due on the account at that time.
I find it difficult to understand NewDays position here, and the fact remains that in 
the two months immediately preceding the credit limit increase in August 2016, Mr P 
had exceeded the credit limit on his account and did incur over limit charges. And 
while NewDay may believe that Mr P could afford to keep his account within the 
credit limit, I feel that the fact that he didnt keep the account within the credit limit 
strongly suggests otherwise.
NewDay have also referenced that, while Mr Ps amount of external credit did 
increase in the months immediately preceding the credit limit increase in August 
2016, his amount of external credit then decreased the following month, in 
September 2016, which NewDay believe gives credence to their position that Mr P 
could afford the further credit being provided to him at that time. However, any 
affordability assessment that NewDay undertook in August 2016 wouldnt have 
included any information about Mr Ps then unknown future financial position in 
September 2016.
Ultimately, upon consideration of the points brought forwards by NewDay, it remains 
my position that the information available to NewDay about Mr Ps financial position 
in August 2016 should, at the very least, have given NewDay cause to suspect that 
Mr P might not be able to afford the credit limit increase such that further checks into 
Mr Ps financial position should have been undertaken by NewDay before 
implementing that credit limit increase.
It also remains my position that the further checks which I remain satisfied NewDay 
should have undertaken should have reasonably included NewDay asking to review 
Mr Ps current account statements. NewDay have stated that there is no requirement 
for them to review such statements.
However, while I agree with NewDay that there isnt a requirement for a credit 
provider to review a customers current account statements as a part of the initial 
affordability assessment, I do feel that in these specific circumstances, where further 
checks are required, it is reasonable to have expected NewDay to have asked to 
review Mr Ps current account statements, in order for NewDay to have ensured that 
they were providing credit to Mr P responsibly. And conversely, I struggle to 
understand how NewDay could have reasonably performed the additional checks 
into Mr Ps financial position which Im satisfied were required here by other means.Mr P also provided some comments, and felt that if I was finding that one provision of 
credit had been unaffordable for him then it should be the case that the other 
provision of credit should be considered as being unaffordable also. Indeed, Mr P 
specifically stated that he didnt think that the two accounts should be looked at in 
isolation.
I can appreciate Mr Ps position here, but I can confirm that every individual provision 
of either new or further credit is looked at individually. This is because a person may 
be able to afford new credit at one time, but a few years later their circumstances 
may have changed such that they can no longer afford further credit.
In this instance, Im satisfied that the information about Mr Ps financial position in 
August 2016 was such that I dont feel that Mr P should have been provided further 
credit by NewDay at that time. However, I feel that the information available about Mr 
Ps financial position in January 2020, when he applied for the second NewDay credit 
account, showed an improved financial position, such that Im satisfied that it was 
reasonable for NewDay to have approved Mr Ps application and provided that new 
credit account to Mr P at that time.
Mr P has also provided new information in relation to the credit increase that was
implemented on the second account in October 2020. Specifically, Mr P has provided 
a letter sent by NewDay on 21 October 2020 advising that theyre increasing the 
credit limit on his second account, and also a letter sent by NewDay two days later, 
on 23 October 2020, explaining that theyre increasing the interest rates on Mr Ps 
first NewDay account because of factors in how hed managed his credit with 
NewDay and with other lenders.
Mr P therefore questions how NewDay could have reasonably increased his credit 
limit on the second account, given that they had stated concerns about how he was 
managing his credit with them, as per the letter sent in relation to the first account.
Having reviewed these two letters, its difficult not to reach the same conclusion as 
Mr P here, and given that NewDay are effectively stating in the letter dated 23 
October 2020 that they have concerns over how Mr P was managing his credit, it 
doesnt seem fair or reasonable to me that they would provide further credit to Mr P 
on his other NewDay administered account only two days earlier.
As such, this letter will be a second provisional decision, amending my original 
provisional decision to also include that I will be upholding Mr Ps complaint as it 
relates to the credit limit increase that took place on his second NewDay credit 
account in October 2020. 
Finally, Mr P has referred to an extended period in the time leading up to his 
application for the second NewDay credit account where he was utilising the large 
majority of the credit available to him on his first NewDay account, which Mr P feels 
suggests he couldnt reasonably afford the second credit account that he applied for.
While I can appreciate Mr Ps point here, a customer can choose to use as much as 
their credit limit as they would like, and I wouldnt consider that the use of a credit 
account even up to 99% percent of the available credit limit should be considered as 
an indicator of potential financial difficulty. Importantly, during that time period, Mr P 
didnt exceed the credit limit of his first NewDay account, and didnt incur any over-
limit fees which I feel would have been indicators of potential financial difficulty, and so I remain satisfied that it was reasonable for NewDay to have approved Mr Ps 
application for that second credit account at that time.
All of which means that my provisional decision here is that I am upholding Mr Ps 
complaint as it relates to the credit limit increase on the first account that took place 
in August 2016 and also as it relates to the credit limit increase on the second 
account that took place in October 2020.
In my second provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr P and NewDay the opportunity to 
respond and to provide any comments or new information they might wish me to consider 
before I moved to a final decision. Both Mr P and NewDay confirmed that they had no further 
comments or submissions they wished to provide.
As such, I see no reason not to issue a final decision upholding this complaint in Mr Ps 
favour on the basis as outlined above, and I can confirm that my final decision will be that I 
am upholding this complaint accordingly.
Putting things right
NewDay must reimburse to Mr Ps first credit account all fees and charges incurred on the 
account from the point of the credit limit increase in August 2016 onwards, as well as 
reimburse all interest accrued on the account relating to the balance of the account above 
£600 from that same point onwards.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance in Mr Ps favour, NewDay must pay this 
balance to Mr P along with 8% interest calculated to the date of payment.
NewDay must also remove all adverse credit reporting from Mr Ps credit file relating to this 
first credit account from August 2016 onwards.
NewDay must reimburse to Mr Ps second credit account all fees and charges incurred on 
the account from the point of the credit limit increase in October 2020 onwards, as well as 
reimburse all interest accrued on the account relating to the balance of the account above 
£900 from that same point onwards.
If these reimbursements result in a credit balance in Mr Ps favour, NewDay must pay this 
balance to Mr P along with 8% interest calculated to the date of payment.
NewDay must also remove all adverse credit reporting from Mr Ps credit file relating to this 
second credit account from October 2020 onwards.
Finally, NewDay must make a payment of £200 to Mr to compensate him for the upset and 
inconvenience this ongoing matter has caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua,
on the basis explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 May 2022.
