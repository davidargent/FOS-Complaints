The complaint
Mr P complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mr P and his wife entered into an acquisition agreement to buy some holiday club 
membership points in August 2009. The price of the points was Â£8,580 and Mr P also 
entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for them. A 
claim was made to Barclays Partner Finance under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer 
Credit Act in August 2019. 
Barclays Partner Finance said that Mr P was out of time under the Limitation Act 1980 to 
bring any claim in respect of the issues he claimed to have happened at the point of sale of 
the acquisition agreement. A complaint was then made to this service in October 2019 that 
Mr P was induced to enter into the acquisition agreement by misrepresentations made by 
the holiday club and that an unfair relationship between Barclays Partner Finance and Mr P 
was created.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ps complaint should be upheld. She said that 
Mr P had six years from the date of the acquisition agreement to make a misrepresentation 
claim but didnt do that until August 2019 so Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on 
the timing of his claim to turn it down. She also said that Mr P had six years from when the 
loan agreement ended to make a section 140A claim but Barclays Partner Finance was only 
contacted in August 2019 so it was entitled to rely on the timing of the claim to turn it down.
Mr Ps representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It says, in summary, that although Mr P was aware that he had a legitimate 
grievance, in so far as he and his wife werent receiving the services they had been 
promised, they werent aware that they had an actionable claim until they took legal advice in 
late 2016. It says that section 32 of the Limitation Act postpones the limitation period in 
cases involving concealment and there was deliberate concealment by the holiday company 
both in respect of the purchase being unlawful, and also the fact that members could exit 
their membership, at any time, by simply giving 28 days notice. It has also referred to a legal 
case in which section 32 was considered.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ps complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down his Consumer Credit 
Act claims under the Limitation Act and I accept that he referred his complaint to this 
service within six years of that happening - but I need to consider whether Barclays 
Partner Finance has acted fairly in saying that  the Limitation Act applies to his 
claims;
Mr Ps claims are under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  in this 
decision Im not determining the outcome of those claims as only a court would be 
able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Ps claim under section 75 is that the holiday club membership was 
misrepresented to him and his wife and that they wouldnt have bought the points if it 
hadnt been misrepresented to them - and if the criteria for a claim under section 75 
were met, Barclays Partner Finance would be expected to consider that claim unless 
the claim was brought outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which 
case it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr P could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his wife 
into buying the membership points soon after they entered into the acquisition 
agreement in August 2009 as that was when they entered into an agreement based 
on the alleged misrepresentations of the holiday company and Mr P suffered a loss 
as he entered into the loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the 
holiday club points;
I consider that Mr Ps cause of action accrued at about that time, so he would have 
had six years from then to bring a claim against either the holiday company or 
Barclays Partner Finance  but he didnt make a claim against Barclays Partner 
Finance until August 2019, about ten years later which was outside of the time limits 
set out in the Limitation Act;
Mr Ps representative says that Mr P only became aware that he could make a claim 
to Barclays Partner Finance after he and his wife took legal advice in 2016  but 
when they had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist Mr P for the purposes of 
the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of that Act are 
extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of 
action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr Ps 
claims;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that Mr P settled the loan in November 2009 - so he 
would have needed to make a claim against Barclays Partner Finance within six 
years of November 2009  but he didnt make a claim to it until August 2019, nearly 
ten years later, which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mr Ps representative has described what it says happened before Mr P entered into 
the agreements in August 2009 and it says that information about the purchase being 
unlawful and that members could exit their membership, at any time, by giving 28 
days notice was deliberately concealed from Mr P so the limitation period is 
postponed under section 32;
section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been 
deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the 
debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have 
been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a 
breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate 
concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Ive considered section 32 and the legal case to which Mr Ps representative has 
referred, but I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that the purchase 
was unlawful or that theres been a deliberate concealment of any relevant 
information so I dont consider that section 32 is applicable in these circumstances;
Barclays Partner Finance said that Mr P was out of time under the Limitation Act to 
bring any claim in respect of the issues he claimed to have happened at the point of 
sale of the acquisition agreement  but I consider it to be clear from its final response 
letter to Mr P that it had only considered his section 75 claim and it hadnt properly 
considered his claim under section 140A so I dont consider that its response to his 
claims was fair and reasonable  but if it had properly considered his claims I 
consider it to be likely that it would have said that they were time-barred under the 
Limitation Act; and
I sympathise with Mr P for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
membership and the difficulties that hes described but I consider that his claims 
under sections 75 and 140A are time-barred so I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to 
refund to him any of the money that he paid under the loan agreement, to pay him 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ps complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 August 2022.
