The complaint
Miss P complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money unfairly recorded a
default on her credit file.
What happened
Miss P had a credit card with 118 118 Money. In April 2022, she contacted them regarding
her financial situation and a repayment plan was agreed. In September 2022, 118 118
Money issued a default notice and the account subsequently defaulted.
Our investigator upheld this complaint. In short, she said Miss P had maintained the
repayment plan and that 118 118 Money werent clear that the account would default if she
fell behind. She therefore asked 118 118 Money to amend Miss Ps credit file, remove the
default and provide compensation of £200.
Miss P accepted. 118 118 Money didnt reply so the complaint has been passed to me to
decide.
I issued a provisional decision, an extract of which is included below:
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As part of Miss Ps agreement with 118 118 Money, and in order to maintain the 
account, Miss P needed to make the contractual minimum payment each month 
towards her credit card which also included interest that had accrued on her balance.
In April 2022 Miss P got in touch with 118 118 Money because she was experiencing
financial difficulties. Her account statements show that at around that time shed 
exceeded her credit limit of £2,000. Miss P said she couldnt meet the contractual 
repayments going forwards and needed the assistance of 118 118 Money.
In response to this 118 118 Money agreed to a repayment plan of £10 per month 
commencing on 1 May 2022, which would be reviewed after six months. I think this 
was fair and reasonable. I say this because it was clear based on a discussion of 
Miss Ps income and expenditure that she couldnt meet her contractual payments 
(which for example in May was approximately £162). And Miss P confirmed £10 was 
affordable for her. In addition to this, 118 118 Money agreed to suspend interest and 
charges although they werent obliged to do so. This meant the amount Miss P owed 
would not increase despite her not making the contractual payments.
Having looked at Miss Ps account statements it seems that the repayment plan was 
broadly maintained although payments were not made on time in July/August. By 
September it seems Miss Ps circumstances still hadnt changed, and she wasnt in a 
position to start making the contractual payments towards her account. Given that 
the repayment plan was a short-term measure and Miss P had already been on her 
plan for a number of months, I think a default was inevitable. It follows that I dont 
think 118 118 Money were wrong to issue a default notice.
For Miss P this would mean 118 118 Money could accept lower payments going 
forwards. This wouldve been beneficial to Miss P as the contractual amounts were 
not affordable. It would also mean interest and charges would be suspended 
indefinitely. Furthermore, having the default recorded earlier would mean it would 
come off Miss Ps credit file at an earlier date.
Miss P said 118 118 Money didnt tell her about the default. Having looked at the 
default notice that was issued on 12 September 2022, I can see that this was sent to 
the address it held for her (and also matches the address we currently hold for her), 
so I think 118 118 Money sent this notification to the right place and therefore they 
did enough to put Miss P on notice that action was needed.
118 118 Money gave Miss P until 3 October 2022 to make the payment, which is in 
line with what I would expect. It seems Miss P didnt make the required payment to 
bring her account back up to date and the account was defaulted. I dont think it was 
unreasonable for 118 118 Money to default the account in the absence of the 
required payment.
So taking everything into account, I dont think 118 118 Money acted unfairly. It 
follows that I wont be asking them to make any amendments to Miss Ps credit file or 
issue her with compensation. I realise this provisional decision will be very 
disappointing for Miss P. But for the reasons Ive explained above I dont currently 
think 118 118 Money need to do anything more to resolve this complaint.
My provisional decision
My provisional decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
118 118 Money didnt reply to my provisional decision.
Miss P replied to say she didnt agree with my decision. She explained she was going 
through a lot in her personal life, and this was the reason why her payments were late. She 
also said she doesnt recall seeing a default letter and that she doesnt think it was fair 118 
118 Money sent her one letter before the default. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to read about Miss Ps personal circumstances and realise this mustve been a 
stressful time for her. However, I still think 118 118 Money treated Miss P fairly because it 
took into account the information she provided to them when the repayment plan was agreed 
and Miss P confirmed it was affordable. I also think 118 118 Money treated her fairly by 
suspending interest and charges during the repayment plan although it wasnt obliged to do 
so.
I appreciate Miss P made the repayments late due to her personal circumstances, but even 
if theyd all been received on time, the repayments were still far less than the contractual 
amount and it seemed inevitable the account was going to default. And as explained in my 
decision, defaulting the account would have been beneficial to Miss P because interest and charges would be permanently suspended, and shed be able to agree a longer-term 
repayment plan.  
Miss P has said she doesnt recall receiving the default notice, but 118 118 Moneys records 
show that this was sent to her, and to the correct address. So I think 118 118 Money did 
issue the notice to the right place and therefore did enough to let Miss P know she needed to 
contact 118 118 Money. 
Miss P has said she doesnt think its fair her account was defaulted after one letter. But 
having looked at the default notice, this gave Miss P approximately three weeks to get in 
touch with 118 118 Money which I think is a reasonable period of time. I dont think its 
unreasonable 118 118 Money subsequently defaulted the account in the absence of any 
contact from Miss P.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 August 2023.
