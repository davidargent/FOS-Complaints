K820x#14complaint
Mr and Mrs J complain that National  Westminster  Bank Plc has wrongly  required them to 
take out a buy to let mortgage  product instead  of a residential product. They  also complain 
about delays when taking out a new product. They ask for compensation for their financial 
loss and inconvenience. 
background
Mr and Mrs J took out a buy to let mortgage  with NatWest in 2007. They  say the mortgage  
should have been treated as a residential  mortgage.  As a concession,  NatWest allowed 
them to take out residential  interest  rate products from 2008. In June  2018  Mr J contacted 
NatWest about a new product. NatWest said it would only offer buy to let products. Mr J also 
says NatWest cancelled  appointments at short notice, meaning they didnt have time to seek 
advice and source a mortgage elsewhere.   
Our investigator said part of the complaint should be upheld.  He said Mr and Mrs Js broker  
applied on their behalf for a buy to let mortgage.  So NatWest didnt make  an error when it 
offered a buy to let mortgage  which Mr and Mrs J accepted. As a concession,  NatWest 
allowed them residential mortgage products but didnt have to continue to do this.
Our investigator said NatWest could  have done  more to assist Mr and Mrs J. He said 
NatWest should  pay £100 compensation for the inconvenience. 
Mr and Mrs J didnt agree. Mr J said NatWest had misled him, breached regulations  and 
benefitted from a booking fee of nearly  £2,000 and a higher interest rate on the mortgage 
than its competitors. He said NatWest cancelled the second appointment with an adviser just 
before the fixed rate product ended. It was too late to apply  to another  lender as this would 
mean theyd  be on NatWests standard variable rate for about six weeks while  the 
application completed. Mr J said £100  wasnt enough compensation.
I didnt agree with all of the investigators recommendations either. I didnt think  the 
complaint should  be upheld.  So I sent a provisional decision to the parties to explain what  I 
thought about the complaint and allow them to comment. In summary, I said NatWest didnt 
have to offer Mr and Mrs J a residential  mortgage product and I didnt think  NatWest  was 
responsible for any delays  in them taking out a new product. 
Mr and Mrs J didnt agree. Mr J said theyd already provided sufficient evidence  to support 
their complaint
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where the evidence is incomplete,  
inconclusive or contradictory, I reach my decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely  to have happened in light of the available  evidence  and 
the wider circumstances. 
Mr J says hes confident  I didnt review his phone calls,  which  he says show  NatWests  
service and complaints  team took him for a ride. While we dont have call recordings, Ive 
considered what  both parties  have said about  the calls, as well as the notes of the calls in 
NatWests records and what  happened  before and after the calls. I can assure  Mr J Ive 
Ref: DRN19536562reviewed all the evidence  available  to me, and I think  I have  enough evidence  to reach a fair 
decision.
Mr and Mrs J took out a buy to let mortgage  in 2007. The mortgage application made  on 
behalf of Mr and Mrs J was for a buy to let mortgage. At one point during the application 
process Mr J said he wouldnt  be letting out the property. He then confirmed in writing that 
the property was a buy to let investment purchase. The mortgage offer was issued on this 
basis, and accepted by Mr and Mrs J. I cant see that NatWest  made  an error here.
In early 2008 Mr J told NatWest they were living in the property. NatWest allowed Mr and 
Mrs J to take out residential  products.  In 2010  Mr J asked for consent to let. Mr and Mrs J 
complained in 2013 that the mortgage was wrongly classed as buy to let. They  took out a 
five year residential product in May 2013. 
Mr and Mrs Js fixed interest rate product was due to expire  on 31 May 2018. Mr J contacted 
NatWest in April 2018 about a product switch.  He opted for self service  and was referred to 
NatWests website. Mr J contacted NatWest as he was only able to take out buy to let 
products online.  Mr J wanted a residential product with a better  interest rate. 
NatWest told Mr J that as the mortgage  was taken out as a buy to let he wouldnt be able to 
take out a residential product on line. Hed have to speak to an adviser  to see if an exception 
was possible.
An appointment was booked with NatWests adviser on 14 May 2018. Mr J says this was 
cancelled at the last minute.  NatWests notes say Mr J was unhappy it couldnt offer him a 
residential rate switch.  It says Mr J raised a complaint about  this on 14 May 2018.
I think the appointment on 14 May 2018  most  likely went  ahead,  or if it didnt it was because 
NatWest told Mr J beforehand that residential products werent available  and no exception  
would be made. I dont need  to listen to a recording of this call to find that Mr and Mrs J were 
given the information they needed   that residential products werent available. They must 
have been told this because Mr J made  a complaint about NatWest  not allowing them  to 
take out a residential product.
NatWest responded  to Mr and Mrs Js complaint confirming it would no longer allow them  to 
apply for residential  products. It said it doesnt usually allow residential products to be taken 
out for buy to let mortgages and needs  to treat all of its customers fairly.  
NatWests notes say another appointment was booked for 4 June 2018  as Mr J was looking 
to switch to a residential mortgage. Mr J says NatWest cancelled  this appointment at short 
notice. While its not clear who cancelled the appointment or why, this doesnt change the 
outcome of my decision  so I dont need to listen to a call recording here. By this time 
NatWest had told Mr and Mrs J that residential products werent available to them. It seems 
unlikely their application for a residential mortgage would have been successful, given the 
property was let out. And it seems Mr and Mrs J had already sought  advice elsewhere, as an 
application was made by a broker on their behalf the next day. 
On 5 June 2018 a broker applied on behalf of Mr and Mrs J for a two year fixed  rate product. 
Mr and Mrs J accepted  the new product which was in place on 8 June 2018. 
Ref: DRN19536563did NatWest act unfairly, mislead  Mr and Mrs J or cause unnecessary  delays or 
inconvenience?
Mr and Mrs J took out a buy to let mortgage.  It seems they lived in the property for a time, 
although not recently. They benefitted  from being able to take out residential products with 
lower interest rates for about 10 years. Nonetheless, this is a buy to let mortgage and the 
property is, so far as I can tell, let out. So I think its fair for NatWest  to say that Mr and Mrs J 
have to choose from its buy to let product  range. 
Mr and Mrs J could have chosen a new buy to let product  in April or May 2018.  They  didnt 
do so because they wanted  a residential product with a lower interest rate and wanted to 
explore whether this was possible. But I dont think NatWest is responsible for this delaying 
them taking out a new product. Once they applied for and accepted a buy to let product, 
there was no delay by NatWest in applying it to their account. 
When Mr and Mrs J took out a new buy to let product with NatWest they agreed to its terms, 
including the product  fee and interest  rate. Mr J says other providers offered better  deals. 
But there was nothing to stop Mr and Mrs J applying to another  provider in good time to 
avoid going onto NatWests standard variable  rate if theyd wanted to do so. 
I dont think NatWest made errors which caused  delays or inconvenience to Mr and Mrs J 
taking out a new product. I think NatWest made them aware  that residential products werent 
available for their buy to let mortgage.  I think any delay or inconvenience was more  likely 
due to Mr and Mrs J wanting  a residential  product  despite being told this wasnt  available   
and trying to achieve  this. It follows that I dont uphold this complaint.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr and Mrs J to 
accept or reject my decision  before  19 June  2020.
