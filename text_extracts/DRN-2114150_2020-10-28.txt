The complaint
C, a limited company, complains that National Westminster Bank Plc transferred its account 
to recoveries so that it no longer had access to it for trading.
What happened
C had an overdraft limit on its account for a number of years. NatWest transferred the 
related borrowing to its specialised business management (SBM) team in 2019 and required 
C to pay down its overdraft to manage with a lower limit. It did not do so, and NatWest gave 
C notice that it would be closing the account in 60 days. After that it transferred the 
outstanding balance to recoveries in February 2020. The director of C says that he was in a 
position to make a repayment if the account was reinstated and complained about the 
impact on C and that he no longer received statements. He said that NatWests actions 
amounted to corporate bullying.
Our investigator did not recommend that the complaint be upheld. She said that it was 
reasonable for NatWest to want to review the overdraft periodically. And she didnt think that 
the contact by NatWest about this to C was excessive. Attempted contact was only repeated 
when C did not respond. NatWest had first raised concerns about the borrowing in 2018 and 
at the time of review of the overdraft in 2019 had given C time to bring down the borrowing. 
C did not meet the reductions required and NatWest made demand and gave C notice of the 
closure of the account. So, it was entitled not to let C operate the account after February 
2020. It had made an arrangement so that C could view its account even though statements 
are stopped when it passes to recoveries.
C did not agree. The director said that he wanted the complaint to be reviewed by an 
ombudsman and that the stress of things was making him ill. All he wanted was weekly 
statements to track the repayments. And so that his accountant can complete the year end 
accounts for C.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry to hear about the directors health problems and what he says about the stress that 
the issues with C has caused him. As this is a complaint from C, a separate legal entity, I 
can only look into the impact on it and a company cannot suffer distress. I have seen 
correspondence about a means for him to access the bank account entries through the 
recoveries team and I know that NatWest has committed to help with this.
C wants me to consider whether its account and borrowing should though be in recoveries at 
all. Ive looked at the records of contact with C and the steps NatWest took from 2018.
The director accepts that there was limited turnover in 2018 to 2019 for C as he was 
concentrating on other things. Following a letter from NatWest expressing concern at the 
lack of credits to the account he had a discussion with NatWest in October 2018. NatWest 
notes saying that it would monitor the position.
C had an overdraft facility of £10,000 that was due to expire on 1 May 2019. NatWest has 
documented how it tried to make contact with the director before this for a review. I can see 
the director told it he was going to be abroad. NatWests concern was the lack of fluctuation 
in the borrowing and that the turnover did not support the limit. The borrowing was 
transferred to the SBM team. 
It was agreed with C to mark the then overdraft limit forward for three months to see whether 
turnover would be in line with projections. NatWest took the view that it hadnt been and 
wanted the overdraft reduced to £5,000. C made progress with this. In November 2019 
NatWest set out that it still had concerns about turnover. But if it saw the reduction in 
borrowing to £3,500 by 4 December 2019 that the director had said was possible it would 
extend a limit of that same amount for 12 months. It notes that this was made clear to the 
director of C in a call and then in a letter confirming this. The letter set out that if this did not 
happen it might ask C to make alternative banking arrangements and repay all the 
borrowing.
The borrowing remained above £5,000 on 4 December 2019. NatWest made demand and 
gave notice to close the account. The director was told that if the borrowing for C was paid 
down further then a limit of £3,500 was still possible. Or if not the account would move to 
recoveries. The director is reported as saying that payment of an invoice was expected, or 
he would use his own funds to do so.
This did not happen and so the account was transferred to recoveries with overdraft 
borrowing still in excess of £5,000 at the time. NatWest explains that this means that the 
account does not now operate other than for payments in to repay the borrowing.
my assessment
I fully understand why the director feels NatWest took unnecessary action given his wider 
business interests and his personal guarantee for the borrowing of C. But NatWest expected 
the account balance on an overdraft to fluctuate and to be supported by the turnover. Its 
right that an overdraft facility is repayable on demand and there was no guarantee that it 
would continue beyond any review date. Here NatWest gave C some time to re-establish 
trading and bring the overdraft down. C did not do so in the way NatWest believed it had 
agreed to. And NatWest had explained the consequences of this. 
So, Im afraid I dont have a reasonable basis to find it made a mistake or acted unfairly even 
when it wouldnt agree to Cs request to reinstate the account. Whilst the communications 
about this from NatWest were clearly unwelcome I dont find the volume of those both in 
written and telephone form to be unreasonable.
I appreciate how disappointed the director will be by my conclusions.My final decision
My decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask C to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 November 2020.
