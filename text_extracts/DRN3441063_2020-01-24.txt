K821x#15complaint
Mr L complains  that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent 
to him.
background
Mr L was given 32 loans  by Sunny between March 2015 and February 2017. Loan 1 was 
due to be repaid  in 7 instalments. All the other  loans  were  due to be repaid in 14 monthly 
instalments, but Mr L generally repaid the loans much earlier than had been  agreed. At times 
Mr L had up to six loans  outstanding at the same  time. All of Mr Ls loans have been fully 
repaid and a summary of his borrowing from Sunny is shown at the end of this decision.
Mr Ls complaint has been looked at by one of our adjudicators. They didnt  think  Sunny had 
been wrong to give loan 1 to Mr L. But they didnt think Sunny should  have agreed  to lend 
from loan 2 onwards  as it was apparent from the pattern  of Mr Ls borrowing that he was 
reliant on the short-term  loans and was unlikely to sustainably repay the amounts borrowed. 
Sunny disagreed and said the pattern indicated Mr L was borrowing as and when he needed 
funds. It also explained  it carried  out checks on Mr L each time he applied for a loan. These 
checks included affordability checks and reviewing information from credit reports. But 
Sunny did offer to uphold Mr Ls complaint about  loan 23 onwards. Mr L declined Sunnys 
offer. 
As the matter was unable to be resolved informally, it was passed to me to issue a final 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr L could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN34410632refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr L could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and the customer  should be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
There was a significant break in Mr Ls borrowing from Sunny. There was a gap of over six 
months between loans 1 and 2. I think it would be reasonable  for Sunny to view this gap as 
an indication  that Mr Ls finances had stabilised after whatever the circumstances that had 
caused him to take out loan 1. So, I will look at Mr Ls borrowing in two separate lending 
chains. 
The first chain was made up of loan 1, and the second chain was loans 2 to 32. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Sunny  needed to do more before it lent Mr L loan 1. Mr L hasnt 
disagreed with the adjudicators findings,  so I wont be making any further findings on this 
loan. I will only be considering the loans in the second chain in this decision. 
Having carefully considered all of the arguments,  evidence and information provided  in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ls complaint,  Im partly upholding the complaint. Ill 
explain why. 
Sunny did some checks before it lent to Mr L. It asked him for details  of his income, and his 
normal expenditure. And it checked  his credit  file before agreeing  the loans. Ive seen a 
summary of those credit checks  and I dont think they showed  anything that should have 
caused additional concerns to Sunny.
As I mentioned earlier all of Mr Ls loans  in this chain were  repayable  over a 14-month 
period. So, the amounts that Mr L needed to repay each time were smaller  than if hed taken 
a normal payday  loan. But of course,  he was committing to making those repayments over a 
significant period.  And at times Mr L had several loans outstanding together.  So, Ive needed  
to consider the total amount that Mr L needed  to repay to Sunny each month.
I think the fact that Mr L typically repaid his loans  much  earlier  than planned should have 
caused some concerns  to Sunny. That might be the sort of behaviour  that would indicate 
that someone was facing  problems managing their money and needing  to refinance loans on 
a regular basis. Ive also taken that into account when looking at whether Sunny  should have 
given the loans to Mr L.
Ref: DRN34410633For loans 2 to 6, I dont  think  the checks Ive described above were  enough for any of the 
loans. Mr L was committing to repay  his loans over a significant period. I think Sunny should 
have taken great care to ensure  that his finances  were stable enough to support such  a 
lengthy commitment. So, I dont  think  it was reasonable for Sunny to base its affordability 
checks only on what Mr L was telling it his finances. 
Instead before lending  Mr L loans 2 to 6, Sunny  ought to taken steps to independently verify   
Mr Ls actual financial position. Had it done a proportionate check  for these loans, it would 
have shown Mr L was struggling to manage his money and was borrowing to pay borrowing. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr L, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt provide further loans. 
I think this point was reached by loan 7. I say this because;
by this loan the overall pattern of Mr Ls borrowing suggested  he was persistently 
reliant on short-term loans. Mr L generally  had multiple loans active  at the same time. 
So Sunny ought  to have known that it was likely  he was not borrowing to meet a 
temporary shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. 
Mr L wasnt making a dent in the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 32 was taken out 15 
months after loan 2 (the first loan in this chain). Mr L had paid large amounts of 
interest to, in effect; service a debt to Sunny over an extended period. 
I think that Mr L lost out because Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 7 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ls indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ls 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr L paid on loan 2 onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 2 to 6 from Mr Ls credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  7 to 32 should be removed from Mr 
Ls credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr L a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN34410634my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ls complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2020.
