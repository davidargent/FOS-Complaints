K820x#14complaint
Mr M says Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) mis-sold him a Current Account Plus 
packaged bank  account. Hes used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to complain.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  at Mr Ms complaint and didnt think Barclays had 
mis-sold the Current Account Plus. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Ms complaint. 
I think Mr M freely chose  to take the Current Account Plus and he couldve used the benefits 
included. And while  Im open  to the possibility  Mr M wasnt  provided with everything  he 
shouldve been,  I havent seen anything  to suggest clearer  information  wouldve changed  his 
decision to take the Current Account Plus in the first place.  So, in these  circumstances, Im 
not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Ms complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 April 2019.
