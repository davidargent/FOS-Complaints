The complaint
Mr S complains that MYJAR Limited lent to him in an irresponsible manner. 
What happened
I issued a second provisional decision on this complaint earlier this month that I summarise 
below.
Mr S was given ten loans by MYJAR between September 2015 and November 2017. The 
loans were due to be repaid over periods of up to a year as shown below. Mr S has 
successfully repaid all his loans. A summary of Mr S's borrowing from MYJAR is as follows;

10 06/11/2017 26/10/2018 £  1,150 12
In my second provisional decision I again explained the basis on which I would decide the 
complaint, and in particular that the checks MYJAR needed to do would need to take into 
account things such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I thought less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
I noted that Mr S and MYJAR had accepted my findings in relation to loans 1 to 4 and about 
loans 8 to 10. I had said that MYJAR hadn't been wrong to give loans 1 to 4 to Mr S but that 
it shouldn't have agreed to give loans 8 to 10 to him.
In response to my first provisional decision Mr S had provided us with more information 
about his finances at the time he'd taken loans 5 to 7. From that information it was clear that 
Mr S was facing significant problems managing his money, and that this was something 
MYJAR would have seen if it had done what I considered to be proportionate checks.So I didn't think MYJAR should have given those three loans to Mr S either and I asked it to 
pay more compensation than it had offered, and I had originally proposed.
Both MYJAR and Mr S have said that they accept my second provisional decision. MYJAR 
has offered to pay the additional compensation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Given that both parties have said 
they accept my second provisional decision I see no reason to alter the conclusions 
I reached.
So I don't think MYJAR should have agreed to give loans 5 to 10 to Mr S. MYJAR needs to 
pay him some compensation. 
Putting things right
I dont MYJAR should have agreed to lend to Mr S after, and including, the loan that he took 
on 11 January 2016 (loan 5). So MYJAR should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mr S on loans 5 to 10.
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the 
date they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ss credit file in relation to 
loans 5 to 7.
The number of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 8 to 10 should be removed from 
Mr Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mr Ss complaint and direct MYJAR Limited to put 
things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 May 2020.
