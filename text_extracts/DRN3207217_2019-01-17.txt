K821x#15complaint
Mrs T has complained about a reviewable  joint life, last-survivor whole life policy  she and 
her husband  were advised  to take out by a predecessor firm of Canada Life Limited  in April 
1994 (henceforth referred  to as policy  B).
Specifically, she says they werent  made aware of the reviewable nature of this policy, or the 
potential size of the premium  increases  following an unfavourable review. In March 2018, 
she was asked to pay an increase in monthly  premium from £42.00  to £106.00,  which she 
cant afford.  
On the contrary,  she recalls the adviser assuring them that they would only ever need to pay 
the initial premium for a fixed  term to maintain the original level of life cover.  
background
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in November 2018 in which I took an 
inquisitorial approach to this complaint  in assessing the whole of the advice Mr and Mrs T 
received in 1994, and not just the whole life policy  about which  Mrs T has specifically 
complained.
In April 1994, Mr and Mrs T arranged a mortgage of £25,000 on a capital repayment basis  
over 15 years to move house. In September 1987, Mrs T had taken out a reviewable  whole 
life policy  on her life for £20,000 for the benefit of her daughter (henceforth  referred to as 
policy A).
Mr and Mrs Ts respective pensions made Mr T more vulnerable financially than Mrs T. So, 
they wanted the mortgage largely  repaid  if Mrs T died, and partly repaid if Mr T died, during 
the term of the loan and they had a budget of £100.00 per month  for this protection  need.  
The adviser quoted a monthly premium of £95.00  for a 15-year decreasing  term assurance  
policy providing life cover of £25,000  on first death which the adviser said was prohibitive 
and didnt meet their wish for a return if they survived the mortgage term. 
So, the adviser recommended Mr and Mrs T to use policy A as protection for the mortgage 
and for them  to take out policy B for their daughters  benefit. This policy  was also 
reviewable and provided life cover  of £20,000, payable  on second death,  at an initial  
monthly premium of £35.00. They were also advised  to take out a joint life, first death 
endowment savings plan over 14 years,  which provided life cover of £6,877  (henceforth 
referred to as policy  C).
Mr T could,  therefore, more than repay the mortgage from the proceeds of policies A and C if 
Mrs T predeceased him.  
For Mrs Ts protection,  policy C would repay part of the outstanding mortgage if Mr T died or 
when it matured in April 2008. When Mr T did sadly die in July 2007, policy C paid a cash  
sum to her of £6,877,  which fully repaid the mortgage whose outstanding balance we 
estimate would  have reduced  to £4,282 by then. 
But, as the proceeds  of policy A and policy B would only become payable whenever  Mrs T 
died, these two policies remained in force in July 2007, subject to future reviews.  
At its 10th anniversary,  policy B was reviewed and Canada  Life notified Mr and Mrs T that the 
monthly premium needed to increase  to £42.00  per month to maintain life cover at £20,000. 
Ref: DRN32072172Otherwise, the sum assured would reduce to £17,700 if they left the monthly  premium  at 
£35.00. Mr and Mrs T chose to increase the premium to £42.00 per month to preserve the 
original level of cover.    
Thereafter, at the next review  in April 2007, and at each annual  review carried out annually  
until April 2015 inclusive,  the monthly  premium  of £42.00 was sufficient to support the sum 
assured of £20,000. In March 2016, Mrs T was notified that the monthly  premium  needed to 
increase to £118.80 to keep life cover  at £20,000  and she chose to keep the monthly  
premium at £42.00.  Accordingly, life cover under the policy reduced to £13,250. 
The review  in March  2017 told her that the monthly premium of £42.00  wasnt  now sufficient 
to support the sum assured of £13,250.  She needed to increase this premium to £78.10  per 
month. As she chose  to keep the monthly premium at £42.00  and life cover reduced to 
£10,380. 
Similarly, the review in March 2018 concluded that her monthly premium of £42.00 wasnt  
sufficient to support  life cover of £10,380 and she needed to increase this premium  to 
£105.88 per month;  otherwise, life cover would reduce around £4,500  which was now 
guaranteed provided she continued to pay £42.00  per month.  Significantly,  though,  the 
policy now would not pay a surrender value. 
On balance, I thought the whole advice Mr and Mrs T received in 1994  was questionable for 
the reasons given in my provisional decision.  
Briefly, I didnt feel the advice wasnt suitable in all circumstances.  In switching policy  A to 
cover the mortgage  and recommending policy B for the benefit  of Mrs Ts daughter, no 
proceeds were payable to their daughter  if Mrs T died first. 
Also, in my view, policy  C was surplus  to their needs  if Mr and Mrs T had simply taken out a 
decreasing term assurance policy the adviser had costed  at £95.00 per month, and left 
policy A for the benefit  of their daughter. I appreciated that Mr and Mrs T were quoted as 
being content for their daughter to receive  a lump sum on Mrs Ts eventual death and they 
wanted policies  that gave  them a surrender  value  if they survived the mortgage term. And I 
did acknowledge Canada Lifes point that this was borne out by Mrs T continuing policies A 
and B after the mortgage had been repaid. 
But the adviser would have known  in 1994  that, as Mr and Mrs T grew  older,  so these 
policies would become progressively more expensive to fund and/or fail to give a worthwhile 
surrender value due to the increasingly greater mortality charges  for life cover.
I invited both Canada  Life and Mrs T to comment on my provisional findings,  a copy  of which  
is attached and forms part of this final decision.
developments     
In response, Mrs T confirmed that she accepted my provisional decision even though she 
didnt quite follow the redress methodology I set out.
Canada Life disagreed with my provisional decision and said that:
Mrs T already held a reviewable whole life policy since 1987,  so she would have 
known how they worked and the premium did increase  at the very first review;
Ref: DRN32072173Mr and Mrs Ts financial situation  had changed by 1994  in that theyd arranged a new 
mortgage which justified  a change in the use to which they put the whole life policy 
Mrs T had taken  out in 1987;
it was appropriate  to provide advice that fully protected Mr T if Mrs T died first, as she 
was a higher earner;
they were fully aware and agreed  that policy B would  pay a lump  sum to their 
daughter on second  death;
It was appropriate  for Mr and Mrs T to take out life cover  for their mortgage.  A whole 
life policy  is more  flexible than a term assurance  policy and offers a surrender value;
On the assumption  the mortgage  was repaid  when Mr T died, or later in 2009, Mrs T 
maintained policy  B for the life cover (and surrender value) it provided;
both policies only required  an increase in monthly premiums at very recent reviews. 
Mrs Ts outgoings  would have reduced when the mortgage was repaid in 2007 or 
2009, so its difficult  to appreciate why she couldnt  afford the higher premiums;
it doesnt agree that the endowment policy was recommended just to utilise  their 
monthly budget  of £100.00. The term of the policy  was restricted  to 14 years  by their 
joint equivalent age. And the policy would have provided a maturity value before the 
mortgage was due to be repaid even if Mr T hadnt sadly died beforehand;        
the policy provider  didnt offer a term assurance policy that expired  beyond age 75, 
so neither Mr nor Mrs T could  have obtained  cover for their 15 year mortgage. It cant  
confirm how the adviser  had costed a decreasing term assurance in 1994 at £95 per 
month. But, Mr and Mrs T rejected a term assurance policy  anyway because  it 
wouldnt have given  them a return if they survived the term of the mortgage;
the whole life policy Mrs T took out in 1987 was intended for the benefit of their 
daughter whenever Mrs T died. That may have been Mrs Ts intention  in 1987, but 
their financial  needs had since changed; they were purchasing a new property;
besides, they were  now content for their daughter to receive  the proceeds of a whole 
life policy  on second death and it wasnt unreasonable to assume that Mr T was likely  
to die first and that did indeed  occur;
when Mr T died in 2007, Canada Life no longer employed advisers,  and it seems  Mrs 
T herself decided to continue both whole life policies in the knowledge that they were 
reviewable and that her financial need  had changed;
it was reasonable  to believe that Mr and Mrs T held a balanced attitude to risk as 
they already owned  a unit-linked  whole of life plan, and an investment and 
endowment policy  each.
findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I would still question why, to protect  their new mortgage, Mr and Mrs T were not simply 
recommended a joint life, first death term assurance policy providing reducing life cover from 
£25,000 over 15 years,  for which the adviser  quoted a premium  of £95.00 per month. 
Whether this policy could have been  provided by Canada  Life at the time or not doesnt  alter 
my view that this type of policy  most  appropriately  fitted their need.   
Instead, they were  recommended to use reviewable policy A Mrs T had taken out in 1987 
on her life for the benefit of their daughter and a 14-year, joint life, first death  endowment  
policy (policy C) which provided life cover  of almost £7,000  to protect their mortgage. 
Together, these  two policies would repay the loan in full if Mrs T died and partly repay the 
Ref: DRN32072174loan if Mr T died.  As it was, policy  C could  have repaid the outstanding mortgage in full in 
July 2007. 
When policy A was first reviewed in 1997, the premium required to maintain life cover of 
£20,000 increased to £35.00, and then to £59.00  per month at the next review in 2002  until 
2013, when it needed to increase to almost £90.00 per month. Mrs T paid these increased 
premiums until she was asked to increase them again to £171.00 per month in 2015  when 
she opted to reduce the sum assured to £12,634  given the mortgage had, by then, been  
repaid.    
Mr and Mrs T were  also advised to take out reviewable whole life policy B for the benefit of 
their daughter to replace policy A. But policy B provided life cover of £20,000,  payable  on 
second death, at an initial cost of £35.00  per month.  This premium  increased to £42.00 at 
the first review in 2004.
I appreciate the adviser recorded  that Mr and Mrs T wanted policies that provided life cover  
and a return if they survived the mortgage term. But policy A (to protect  their mortgage) and 
policy B (for the benefit of their daughter) were  reviewable and Im not convinced that a 
reviewable whole life policy on the life of Mrs T only was suitable  for a joint mortgage and to 
act as a future investment  once that mortgage  was repaid.
When Mr T died, no claim arose on policies A or B which, it seems,  Mrs T continued for the 
life cover and the prospect of a future  return.  But, other than the need  to make provision for 
her daughter  (originally  met by policy A and now by policy B), I cant  see what life cover 
need policy A was meant to satisfy once  the mortgage had been repaid. So, it does seem  
that she continued both policies for the surrender  value they could provide. 
But, even  though the monthly premiums to policy A and policy  B didnt increase significantly  
until 2013 and 2016 respectively, their surrender values were  likely to have been eroded  in 
the meantime  by the increased mortality charges deducted from their ongoing  fund value as 
Mr and Mrs T grew  older. By November 2018,  policy A provided life cover of £12,500 and 
had a fund value of approximately £1,000, and policy B guaranteed cover  of £4,500 for life 
but didnt offer a surrender value at all.
I do appreciate that the adviser  would  not have known in 1994 precisely how the benefits  
and ongoing  value of these two policies would change over time. But he did know
Mr and Mrs Ts ages  at outset and that the policies were reviewable and would have 
applied increasing  mortality charges for the ongoing fund value to meet the cost of providing 
life cover.                 
Once Mr T died in July 2007, the risk of paying  a claim  under policy  B on Mrs Ts death  
would have increased significantly,  with a consequent increase in mortality deductions 
which, in turn, would  reduce the policys surrender  value. But, in any event, I cant  see the 
need for Mrs T to continue policy A after the claim value from policy C had enabled her to 
repay the mortgage in July 2007.  If she did maintain  premium payments to policy  A for the 
surrender value it could provide, the reviewable nature of the policy didnt make it suitable 
as an investment with her advancing age.   
Policy B has now reached the position where  Mrs T must continue  to pay £42.00 per month 
for life cover  to be guaranteed at £4,500. But, as the policy  didnt offer a surrender value, Im 
not sure what value this policy offered Mrs T either after the mortgage had been repaid.  
Ref: DRN32072175I accept the adviser  recorded Mr and Mrs Ts wish to take out protection policies that also 
offered a future  return. But my view remains that the simplest,  and most appropriate, advice  
for Mr and Mrs T in 1994 was to leave policy A for the benefit of their daughter and to take 
out a 15-year, joint life decreasing term assurance  policy for £25,000, payable  on first death 
for which the adviser quoted a monthly premium  of £95.00. We have calculated that the 
amount payable from this policy (equivalent to the amount still owing on the mortgage) when 
Mr T died in July 2007 would have been  £4,282. There was no need  for Mr and Mrs T to 
have taken out policy C at all. 
decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mrs Ts complaint.
For the purposes of calculating redress,  I have assumed that a 15-year joint life, first death 
decreasing term assurance providing initial life cover of £25,000  would have cost £95.00  per 
month in 1994  and would have paid a death  claim of £4,282 in July 2007.     
Canada Life Limited  should pay Mrs T redress of (D + E) plus (K + O), where:
Policy C (Flexible Savings Manager)
A = the total monthly premiums Mr and Mrs T paid to policy C from time-to-time, from 
the start date of the policy to the date of the death claim  payment;
B = Interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum simple on the premiums  in A 
paid from time-to-time  from the start date of policy C to the date of the death claim 
payment;
C = The death  claim value paid under policy C of £6,877;
D = A + B - C = the loss on policy C at the date the death claim was paid;
E = Interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum simple on D from the date of the 
death claim payment  under policy C to-date.
Policy B (Flexible Cover Plan)
F = the total of the monthly premiums of £95.00  Mr and Mrs T would have paid from 
time-to-time to a 15-year joint life, first death decreasing term assurance (DTA)  policy 
for £25,000, less the monthly premiums  they actually paid to policy B from time-to-
time, from the start date of policy B to the date the death claim was paid under policy 
C;
G = Interest at the rate of eight  per cent per annum simple on the net monthly 
premiums in F paid from time-to-time from the start date of policy  B to the date the 
death claim was paid under policy C;
H = the death  claim of £4,282  that would have been paid under the DTA policy  in F 
in July 2007;
I = H - (F + G) = the loss at the date of claim in July 2007  for Mr and Mrs T not taking  
out a DTA policy  in April 1994;
Ref: DRN32072176J = Interest at the rate of eight  per cent per annum simple on I from the date of claim 
in July 2007 to-date;
K = I + J
L =  the monthly premiums Mrs T has paid to policy B from time-to-time  from August 
2007 to-date;
M = interest  at the rate of eight per cent per annum simple  on each premium in L 
paid from time-to-time  from July 2007 to-date;
N = the current surrender value of policy B;
O = L + M - N.
Mrs T may continue to pay premiums  to policy B, if she so wishes.
If Canada Life Limited  considers its legally obliged to deduct  income  tax from the interest 
calculated in B, E, G, J and M, it must send a tax deduction  certificate with the 
payment. Mrs T may reclaim any tax overpaid from Her Majestys Revenue  and Customs, if 
her circumstances allow her to do so. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 February  2019.

complaint
Mrs T has complained about  a reviewable, joint life last-survivor, whole  life policy she and her 
husband were advised  to take out by a predecessor firm of Canada  Life Limited in April 1994 
(henceforth referred to as policy B).
Specifically, she says they werent made aware of the reviewable nature of the policy, or the potential 
size of the premium increases following an unfavourable  review. In March  2018,  she was asked to 
pay an increase in monthly premium from £42.00 to £106.00, which she cant  afford. 
On the contrary, she recalls  the adviser assuring them  that they would only ever need  to pay the 
original premium for a fixed  term to maintain the original level of life cover.  
background
In April 1994,  Mr and Mrs T were in their late 60s and early 60s respectively.  They  were moving 
house which required them to take a mortgage of £25,000 on a capital repayment basis over 15 
years.
In September 1987, Mrs T had taken out a reviewable whole life policy  on her life for £20,000 for the 
benefit of her daughter (henceforth referred to as policy A), which we understand is still force.
Also, Mr and Mrs T had each taken out a 10-year  endowment savings policy  in 1989  which provided 
life cover of £3,600 and £3,150 respectively.
The mortgage  lender  didnt require Mr and Mrs T to take out life cover with the loan. But their 
respective pensions  made Mr T more vulnerable  financially than Mrs T. So, they wanted the mortgage 
largely repaid if Mrs T died, and partly repaid if Mr T died,  during the term of the loan and they had a 
budget of £100.00 per month for this protection need. 
The adviser  considered term assurance policies, but their cost was prohibitive and they wouldnt  have 
met Mr and Mrs Ts wish for a return if they survived the mortgage term.  
Policy A taken out by Mrs T in September 1987  was originally intended for the benefit  of her daughter. 
But the adviser recommended  Mr and Mrs T to use this policy  as protection for the mortgage and for 
them to take out policy B for their daughters benefit. This policy was also reviewable and provided  life 
cover of £20,000,  payable on second death, at an initial  monthly premium  of £35.00.
Mr and Mrs T were  then advised to take out a joint life, first death  endowment savings plan over 14 
years, which provided  life cover of £6,877 (henceforth referred to as policy C).
In this way, Mr T could more  than repay the mortgage from the proceeds of policy A and policy  C if 
Mrs T predeceased  him.  
For Mrs Ts protection,  policy C would repay part of the outstanding mortgage if Mr T died or, 
otherwise, when it matured  in April 2008. When Mr T did sadly  die in July 2007,  policy C paid a cash 
sum to her of £6,877. But, as the proceeds of policy  A and policy  B would only become payable 
whenever Mrs T died,  these two policies  remained  in force in July 2007,  and were subject to future 
reviews.  
At its 10th anniversary, policy B was reviewed and Canada Life notified Mr and Mrs T that the monthly  
premium needed to increase to £42.00 per month to maintain life cover at £20,000. Otherwise, the 
sum assured  would reduce to £17,700 if they left the monthly premium at £35.00.  Mr and Mrs T 
elected to increase the premium to £42.00 per month to preserve the original level of cover.     
Ref: DRN32072178Thereafter, at the next review in April 2007, and at each  annual review carried  out annually until April 
2015 inclusive, the monthly premium of £42.00 was sufficient to support the sum assured of £20,000. 
At the policy review  In March  2016, Mrs T was notified that the monthly  premium of £42.00 wasnt 
enough to cover her life for £20,000. She was invited  to increase this premium to £118.80 to keep life 
cover at £20,000 until the next review.  Mrs T chose to keep the monthly  premium at £42.00,  so life 
cover under her policy reduced to £13,250. In doing  so, she lost the opportunity  to restore this cover 
to £20,000 in future without providing  health evidence.
The review in March 2017 told her that the monthly premium  of £42.00 wasnt now sufficient to 
support the sum assured  of £13,250. She needed to increase this premium to £78.10 per month. Mrs 
T chose to keep the monthly premium  at £42.00 and life cover reduced to £10,380.
Similarly, the most recent review in March  2018 concluded that her monthly  premium of £42.00 wasnt 
sufficient to support life cover of £10,380. She needed to increase  this premium to £105.88 per 
month; otherwise, life cover  would reduce to £4,631. Also, the policy now no longer  offered a 
surrender value. 
All policy reviews to March 2011 inclusive assumed  a future annual  growth  in the policy fund of six per 
cent per annum. If this rate fell below  six per cent per annum, there was a risk of the premium not 
being sufficient to support the existing  level of life cover and may need to increase at future  reviews.
From March 2012, this message changed to say that the current premium may not support life cover 
for the rest of Mrs Ts life assuming a future rate of growth of six per cent per annum. So, even if a 
review was favourable, it was almost certain she would  need  to increase her premiums  at a future 
review. Canada  Life could calculate the premium she would need to have paid now to support the 
current level of life cover for the rest of her life (assuming a future  rate of growth of six per cent per 
annum) and, in doing so, reduce the potential premium  increases at future  reviews.
Since March 2014, reviews have assumed a lower future rate of growth  of 4.50 per cent per annum  
and, by the March 2018 review, this assumption was one per cent per annum. As such, the likelihood 
of the policy reviews being  unfavourable increased  after March 2013.
Also, with the March 2018 review, the sum assured has now reduced to its minimum level, which 
means the policy is guaranteed to pay £4,631 on Mrs Ts death  provided she continues  to pay the 
monthly premium  of £42.00. 
At the point of sale in April 1994, Canada Life didnt offer a non-reviewable  version of policy  B.
Initially, Canada Life suggested that Mrs Ts complaint had been made out-of-time because the policy 
literature she received  in 1994 explained in detail  the operation  of policy  reviews. Also, when  the 
policy was first reviewed  in April 2004, she agreed to the premium increase recommended by the 
review. She, therefore,  knew  the policy  was reviewable and that the premium could increase 
significantly (on this occasion, by 20 per cent).
In response, one of our investigators considered the complaint and didnt think  it had been made  too 
late. Mrs Ts complaint  was not that she hadnt appreciated policy  B was reviewable; it was the extent 
of the premium increase at the 2018 review  - from £42.00  per month to £106.00 per month - that gave 
her cause for concern.
While Canada Life maintained that the complaint was out-of-time, it agreed that our service could 
consider its merits.
Having reviewed  the sale of the policy, the investigator thought the complaint should be upheld. 
Briefly, he said that:
Ref: DRN32072179Mr and Mrs T had an identified need in April 1994  for their daughter eventually  to receive 
£20,000 at a specific point  in the future. The review  outcomes in 2011, 2012  and 2013, which 
increased the premium  significantly to continue supporting life cover of £20,000 compromised  
that objective;
according to the initial illustrations, the policy cash value after 15 years at the highest growth 
rate of 10 per cent per annum would be only around £5,000  - far less than the £20,000 Mr 
and Mrs T required it to pay on second death.  As such, there  was always  a very real risk that 
the premium would  need  to increase, and substantially so, at some stage, to meet this 
liability. He wasnt satisfied that Mr and Mrs T understood and willingly accepted this 
possibility.
As the investigator couldnt be sure what otherwise  Mr and Mrs T would  have done in 1994,   given 
Canada Life didnt market  a non-reviewable policy at the time, he recommended that Mrs T should 
receive a refund of premiums to policy  B, plus interest at eight per cent per annum  simple,  less its 
current surrender  value.
.
In response, Canada Life didnt accept  the investigators assessment and said that:
it wasnt correct to say that the policy reviews  in 2011, 2012 and 2013 failed. The monthly  
premium Mrs T was paying  of £42.00 was sufficient to support the sum assured  of £20,000 
until the 2016  review.  Only since 2016 have the annual reviews required the premium to 
increase and, each time, Mrs T decided not to do so. As a result, the sum assured has fallen 
to £4,631   the minimum level of life cover policy  B is guaranteed to pay on her death  if she 
maintains the monthly  premium at £42.00;
that the original  illustrations gave  a future value  after 15 years of less than £5,000 doesnt 
mean the policy wouldnt  meet  its liability to pay £20,000 on second death. Policy B wasnt  
obliged to provide  a cash value of £20,000  after 15 years; it was contracted to pay £20,000 on 
second death. In any event,  the illustrative cash values dont represent the higher and lower 
amounts the policy  might pay;
the policy  literature fully explained that the policy  was subject to review  and Mrs T had been 
aware of this at all times;
The investigator responded  to say that, in 1994, Mrs T quite specifically  wanted to leave £20,000 on 
her death to her daughter eventually . But Mrs T took out policy A on a single life basis expressly for 
the benefit  of her daughter whenever Mrs T died. Its not clear, therefore,  why policy  B wasnt taken 
out on a single life basis as well. So, he maintained  that policy B was an unsuitable recommendation.
Canada Life disagreed and said that it was acceptable for policy  B to be set up on a last-survivor 
basis as Mrs T wanted  her daughter to receive  £20,000 eventually. Also, the reviewable nature of the 
policy was explained  to Mr and Mrs T in 1994 and Mrs T already had existing knowledge  of this type 
of policy since she took out policy A in 1987.
As no agreement has been reached in this complaint, it has been referred  to me for review.
provisional findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
I appreciate that Mrs Ts complaint specifically  refers to the reviewable nature  of the policy B. But Ive 
also considered the overall advice Mr and Mrs T received when they arranged  a capital repayment 
mortgage of £25,000 over 15 years,  taking  into account  their existing  arrangements at the time. 
Mrs T had already taken out a reviewable whole life policy on her life (policy A) in 1987,  the 
proceeds of which were  intended for the benefit of her daughter, in part to meet  her travel costs of 
attending the funeral as she lived abroad. The original premium to this policy was £315.00 per annum, 
which she converted  to a monthly premium of £26.25 from September  1993.  
Ref: DRN320721710Policy A was first reviewed in 1997 which found that Mr and Mrs T needed to increase  this monthly  
premium to £34.40 to keep the sum assured at £20,000. They  agreed to do this. The September  2002 
review recommended an increase to the premium to £58.60 to maintain the sum assured at £20,000 
and they agreed to pay this premium as well.  
Thereafter, each annual review from 2007 to 2012 enabled this monthly  premium to remain 
unchanged in support of the sum assured of £20,000.
The 2013 review recommended an increase  to the monthly premium to £89.10 and they agreed to 
pay this premium to keep  the life cover at £20,000.
But, in 2015, Mr and T were  sked  to pay £170.94  per month to maintain life cover  at £20,000  and they 
decided to hold the premium  at £89.10 which reduced the sum assured to £12,634. The policy  has 
continued to provide this level of cover  to-date  at the same premium.   
Mr and Mrs T also each held a 10-year endowment savings policy since 1989, which provided life 
cover of £3,600 and £3,150 respectively. But, as neither Mr nor Mrs T died before 1999, they would 
have received a maturity  value from them.  
The mortgage  cost them £195 per month and the lender  didnt require them to take out life assurance 
to repay the outstanding  balance of the loan if either one of them died within the 15 year term. But, as 
both Mr and Mrs T; particularly, Mr T, received modest pensions,  they accepted  advice to take out life 
assurance which would repay the whole loan if Mrs T died, and some of the loan if Mr T died. This 
would seem to be appropriate advice in principle.
But I dont think the nature and terms of the two policies  they took out were suitable for their needs in 
all circumstances.
The adviser  recommended Mrs T to use policy A to repay the mortgage if she died rather than for the 
proceeds to be paid to her daughter.
To maintain  provision for Mrs Ts daughter,  Mr and Mrs T were recommended to take out a joint life, 
last-survivor reviewable  whole life policy (policy B) with their daughter as beneficiary, so she would 
receive £20,000  eventually. The original premium for this policy  was £35.00 per month.   
As Mr and Mrs T had a budget of £100.00 per month to protect the mortgage,  they were also 
recommended to take out a 14-year, joint life, first death endowment savings policy  (policy C) 
costing £65.00 per month. The policy incorporated life cover of £6,877. Both the term of this policy  
and the level of life cover it provided seem to be entirely arbitrary just to utilise their remaining  monthly 
budget without  allowing  for future  increases  in the monthly premium to policy B at review.
This advice met Mr and Mrs Ts respective financial  needs in 1994 as follows.
If Mr T died first, and before the mortgage was repaid,  policy C would pay the greater of £6,877 and 
the value of the policy  at the time.  As it was, when  Mr T did sadly  die in July 2007,  the policy  paid 
£6,877, as its value was £4,277.  Also, he would  have received a maturity  value from his 10-year 
endowment policy, or £3,600  if he had died before  it matured in 1999. So, altogether,  Mrs T would 
have received roughly  £10,500 from these  two policies on Mr Ts death which would enable her to 
repay some of the mortgage loan.   
On the other hand, if Mrs T died first, and before the mortgage had been repaid, policy  A would have 
paid £20,000 and policy C £6,877. In addition, Mrs Ts 10-year endowment policy would  have paid a 
maturity value  in 1999, or £3,150 if she died beforehand. So, altogether,  Mr T stood  to receive 
approximately £30,000, which more than covered their outstanding mortgage.    
Ref: DRN320721711But, crucially,  the advice didnt meet their need to provide  for their daughter if Mrs T died first because  
policy B was written on a joint life, last-survivor  basis. It would not have paid a death  claim  at that time 
and their daughter, who would naturally  have  wanted to attend her mothers funeral, would receive 
nothing from this policy  until Mr T then died.  So, the advice was flawed  in these  circumstances.
As noted earlier, I would question the sale of policy  C, as its term didnt match the term of the 
mortgage loan. And the joint life cover  of £6,877 appears to have been decided solely on the amount 
of cover the remaining  £65.00  per month of their budget would give them over 14 years.  
At that time, policy A wasnt  due its first review  until 1997 which, as it happens, required Mr and Mrs T 
to increase their monthly premium. I can appreciate  why they followed the review recommendation to 
increase the monthly  premium further in 2002  to keep the sum assured  at £20,000 because  this policy  
was still protecting Mr T against the mortgage  which  wasnt due for repayment until 2009. As it was, 
no further premium increase was necessary  until the mortgage was repaid.  But, as this policy was 
being used to protect  Mr T while the mortgage remained outstanding, it was no longer needed  after 
July 2007, and certainly not after 2009  when the mortgage was due to be repaid,  unless Mrs T 
continued it for its surrender  value. 
(Its also worth noting that the mortgage was capital repayment and, therefore, the outstanding 
amount would  have been reducing from £25,000 each year since 1994. So, its likely that policy A 
didnt need to continue providing  a sum assured  of £20,000 for Mr Ts benefit  before July 2007 as the 
loan would have been much less than that by then.)
In any event, policy A should  have reverted back to a policy for the benefit of Mrs Ts daughter since 
July 2007 because it was no longer required as protection for Mr T after that date. So, as events  
transpired, it was understandable why Mrs T would want to maintain cover at £20,000  under policy  A 
if its proceeds were intended  for the benefit of her daughter.
In turn, this made policy B redundant after July 2007.
With particular regard to the advice Mr and Mrs T received in April 1994,  I think  its ambitious to 
recommend a reviewable whole life policy both as a protection  policy for a mortgage and as an 
investment that could  provide a favourable surrender  value. By its nature, a reviewable  policy  is 
unlikely to give a substantial surrender value  in the long term as the lives assured  grow  older.
In my view,  in April 1994, Mr and Mrs T should have been recommended  to leave policy A in force  for 
the benefit  of their daughter. As protection for their mortgage,  policy B should  have been a 15-year 
(non-reviewable) joint life, first death decreasing term assurance (DTA) policy  for £25,000 and policy 
C should  not have been sold to Mr and Mrs T at all. (The adviser did record that a term assurance 
policy for their mortgage would have cost Mr and Mrs T £95.00 per month but I dont know the terms 
on which this policy was costed.)   
In this way, if Mr T died first, policy B would pay an amount roughly  equal to the outstanding  balance 
of the mortgage and Mrs T would  have received,  or would  have already received, the value of Mr Ts 
10-year endowment  policy,  thereby giving her a surplus over and above  the mortgage debt.
On the other hand, if Mrs T died first, policy A would pay £20,000 to their daughter. Policy B would  
also repay the mortgage for Mr T which,  together  with the proceeds from Mrs Ts 10-year endowment 
(and from his 10-year  endowment at maturity  as well) would give Mr T a surplus  payment, thereby 
satisfying their financial  needs in all circumstances.
That Mr T sadly died in July 2007, and policy C has paid the death claim, doesnt prevent  me 
returning Mrs T to the position  I think she would have been in now but for the advice she and her 
husband received in April 1994.
Ref: DRN320721712I appreciate that, when  Mrs T repaid the mortgage in 2009, her outgoings  would have reduced by 
£195.00 per month. As such,  its not immediately  obvious to me why she couldnt  afford the increased  
premium to policy B from April 2018. 
Even so, I can understand  why Mrs T continued  premium  payments to policies A and B to provide for 
her daughter because the level of life cover was reducing under each policy at recent reviews.
So, to resolve this complaint, I think Canada Life should  offer Mrs T compensation on the basis that, 
in April 1994,  Mr and Mrs T should have been recommended a 15-year (non-reviewable) joint life, first 
death DTA policy for £25,000 (instead of policy  B) and should not have taken  out policy C at all. 
Policy A should have continued in force for the benefit of their daughter.
       
provisional decision
My provisional  decision  is that I uphold Mrs Ts complaint.
Canada Life Limited should pay her redress of (D + E) plus (K + O), where:
For policy C
A = the total monthly premiums Mr and Mrs T paid to policy C from time-to-time,  from the start 
date of the policy to the date of the death claim payment;
B = Interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum simple  on the premiums  in A paid from 
time-to-time from the start date of policy  C to the date of the death claim payment;
C = The death claim value paid under  policy C of £6,877;
D = A + B - C = the loss on policy  C at the date the death  claim was paid;
E = Interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum simple  on D from the date of the death  
claim payment  under policy  C to-date.
For policy B
F = the total monthly premiums Mr and Mrs T would have  paid to a 15-year non-reviewable, 
joint life, first death decreasing term assurance (DTA)  policy for £25,000,  less the monthly  
premiums they actually  paid to policy B, from time-to-time from the start date of policy  B to the 
date the death claim was paid under policy C;
G = Interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum simple  on the net monthly  premiums in F 
paid from time-to-time from the start date of policy B to the date the death claim was paid 
under policy C
H = the death claim that would have been paid under the DTA policy  in F in July 2007;
I = H - (F + G) = the loss at the date of claim  in July 2007 for Mr and Mrs T not taking out the 
DTA policy in April 1994;
J = Interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum simple on I from the date of claim in July 
2007 to-date;
K = I + J
L =  the monthly premiums Mrs T has paid to policy B from July 2007 to-date;
M = interest at the rate of eight  per cent per annum simple on each premium in L paid from 
time-to-time from July 2007 to-date;
Ref: DRN320721713N = the current surrender value  of policy B;
O = L + M - N.
Mrs T may continue to pay premiums to policy B if she so wishes.
If Canada Life Limited considers its legally obliged to deduct income  tax from the interest calculated 
in B, E, G, J and M, it must send a tax deduction certificate with the payment. Mrs T may reclaim 
any tax overpaid  from HM Revenue and Customs, if her circumstances allow her to do so.
