The complaint
Mr S complains PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) put on hold a payment after
theyd told him hed receive the money within 24 hours.
What happened
In March 2022 Mr S opened a PayPal account as a personal seller. And after making his first
online sale he said he was asked to provide photo identification and the tracking number for
the item to PayPal. He said after hed supplied these, he got a message from PayPal that
said hed receive his payment within 24 hours. But several days later he still hadnt received
the payment. He called PayPal and was told they were following their process and needed
confirmation from the buyer that the delivery had been made before the payment would be
released. And if there wasnt any contact from the buyer the payment would be released and
he said he was given a date that was 17 days prior to his call. Mr S said when he questioned
this, they hung up on him. He complained to PayPal.
PayPal said theyd followed their User Agreement policy which Mr S agreed to when he
opened his account. And once they received confirmation from the buyer of receipt of
delivery Mr S funds would be released. And if they didnt hear back from the buyer Mr S
funds would be paid to him in early April 2022.
Mr S wasnt happy with PayPals response he reiterated that PayPal told him the payment
would be released within 24 hours. And theyd failed to address his customer service
concerns. He also said PayPal should pay him interest for the time they held his money.
Mr S referred his complaint to us.
Our investigator said PayPal had followed their User Agreement policy. And Mr S being a
new seller had a limited history with PayPal. She said PayPal had acted fairly and
reasonably in holding the payment pending confirmation of delivery, and the potential for
buyer dispute. Mr S didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to decide.
I issued a provisional decision in October 2022 that said:
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Im currently minded to partially uphold this complaint. Ill explain why.
Its not in dispute that Mr S had a PayPal account. And to open his PayPal account Mr S
would have had to agree to PayPals User Agreement policy and as part of that their Seller
Protection Program. So, in reaching my decision Ive considered whether PayPal have acted
fairly and reasonably in applying this policy. For me to ask them to do something differently I
must be satisfied that theyd done something wrong.
Mr S has shown the message he received from PayPal about the transaction, it said:
You have successfully updated the shipping information. Youll get your money within 1 day
of delivery
Within the User Agreement policy there are PayPals basic requirements about what
constitutes proof of delivery. Which is documentation from a shipping company that
includes, an online and verifiable tracking number, date of delivery and delivered status,
and address details including an address for the recipient that matches the shipping
address.
Mr S has given information as proof that the delivery was made. I can see this shows the
shipping company, a tracking number and the date of delivery but doesnt show all the
information outlined above. From what I can see the item was collected from the postal office
and not delivered to an address.
While I can understand Mr S expectation that his money would be paid within one day as
hed evidence the delivery had been made. His proof of delivery doesnt fully satisfy PayPals
basic requirements which he agreed to when he opened his account. I think the message
gives an indication of when a payment will be made. But the screenshot Mr S has sent us
showing the message, doesnt show that the item has been delivered. And I can see it
shows under the buyers name On Hold .
PayPal said they placed the payment on hold pending confirmation from the buyer that
delivery had been made. Ive considered PayPals User Agreement policy and this says
hold is an action that PayPal may take under certain circumstances either at the transaction
level or the account level. When PayPal places a hold on a payment amount, the money is
not available to either the sender or the recipient. PayPal reviews many factors before
placing a hold on a payment, including account tenure, transaction activity, business type,
past customer disputes, and overall customer satisfaction.
And goes on to give specific examples of when this could happen, one of which is:
A user has not provided sufficient Information to us to enable us to verify their identity or the
identity of their business and/or the user has a limited trading history with PayPal.
Mr S did have a limited trading history, as hes said this was his first online sale. So, I dont
think PayPal acted unfairly or unreasonably in applying the terms of their User Agreement
policy.
But when Mr S called to find out why his payment hadnt been released to him. I dont think
this was clearly explained to him. Having listened to the call hes only told that PayPal were
following their process in waiting for the buyer to confirm delivery. I can understand Mr S'
frustration as hed provided the tracking information that showed to him the item had been
delivered. But the reasoning for his payment being placed on hold wasnt explained to him.
And in the call, he was told a date that the money would be released to him, which was a
date which had already passed. When Mr S challenged this the call ended. I cant know
whether the call was terminated by PayPal, or the line simply got disconnected, but listening
to the call I think the former is most likely what happened. I havent seen any evidence that
PayPal tried to call Mr S back.
Mr S has also shown he experienced further difficulties in trying to contact PayPal about the
issue. So overall, I think Mr S experienced poor customer service, and this caused him
unnecessary distress and inconvenience.Mr S has asked that PayPal pay interest for the time when theyd placed the payment on
hold until it was released. PayPals User Agreement policy says:
You will not receive interest or any other earnings on the money in your account. This is
because the money in your account is electronic money and applicable laws forbid
paying interest on electronic money.
So, I dont think PayPal has acted unfairly or unreasonably as they have adhered to their
User Agreement policy.
Responses to my provisional decision
Neither party asked for any further representations to be considered.
My final decision
I partially uphold this complaint. And ask PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to pay Mr S 
Â£50 for the distress and inconvenience their poor customer service caused him.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 November 2022.
