The complaint
Mr R complains that TransUnion International UK Limited shared his full credit report with his 
sibling. Mr R wants TransUnion to compensate him for the impact the mistake has had on 
him.
What happened
In early August 2021, Mr R told TransUnion that it had shared his credit information with his 
sibling. As a result, his sibling put their mortgage application on hold.
TransUnion apologised and explained that the mistake had come about due to a data 
matching error which had since been put right. Mr R was unhappy with TransUnions 
response so brought a complaint to this service.
After considering Mr Rs complaint, the investigator didnt think that TransUnions apology 
was enough. She recommended that it pay Mr R £150 to apologise.
Mr R isnt happy with the proposed level of compensation. He says that financial data 
breaches often involve compensation of thousands of pounds. Mr R thinks that the stress he 
has felt together with the sensitivity of the breach, should be reflected in a much higher 
amount of compensation. Mr R told the investigator that he would accept a minimum 
compensation payment of £500.
As Mr R didnt agree with the proposed resolution of his complaint, it has come to me for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I should first say that although Mr R is unhappy about the impact the mistake has had on his 
sibling, I can only consider how Mr R has been affected. It would be for his sibling to bring a 
complaint in their own name.
TransUnion accepts that it made a mistake when a data matching error allowed Mr Rs 
sibling to see his data. I agree with the investigator that an apology alone wasnt enough to 
put things right. The key thing that I need to consider is whether the investigators 
recommendation that TransUnion pay Mr R £150 is fair and reasonable.
Mr R has mentioned awards of many thousands of pounds in these kinds of financial data 
breach cases. As the investigator told Mr R, I dont know where he has seen these kinds of 
figures. I should also say that this service isnt a regulator, so I cant impose any penalties on 
TransUnion. 
I appreciate Mr R found the experience upsetting and embarrassing. But this wasnt a case 
involving repeated or long-standing mistakes on the part of TransUnion. Mr R complained in 
early August 2021 and by the end of September 2021, TransUnion confirmed the error had 
been put right. Although the mistake shouldnt have happened in the first place, Im satisfied 
that TransUnion did what I wouldve expected it to by sorting the problem out.
I dont have evidence to suggest that Mr R himself suffered a financial loss because of 
TransUnions mistake. Although Mr R says his sibling had to put a mortgage application on 
hold because of the data matching problem, this isnt a financial loss that Mr R suffered so I 
cant reasonably require TransUnion to compensate Mr R for this. It would be for Mr Rs 
sibling to raise a complaint if they choose.
Overall, Im satisfied that an award of £150 adequately reflects the impact the mistake has 
had on Mr R. Im sorry if this comes as a disappointment to him.
Putting things right
TransUnion International UK Ltd should pay Mr R £150.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint. In full and final settlement, I require TransUnion 
International UK Ltd to pay the amount outlined above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 March 2022.
