K820x#14complaint
Mr F complains about how PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie ,SCA dealt with his complaint about a 
fraudulent account  that had been  set up in his name.
background
Mr F says he received a letter from a debt collection company instructed by PayPal about a 
debt in his name. He says he knew the debt couldnt be his and contacted  PayPal about  it on 
about the 24 July 2018. Mr F says PayPal allowed his details to be used fraudulently and he 
was forced  to take four days off work  to wait for PayPals  promised  call back to him to say 
matters were resolved.  He says he lost four days work as he cant  use a phone whilst in 
work and was told to stay by his phone. And the problem caused  him family arguments and 
forced him to take out a loan. He also says he spent  a considerable amount of time trying to 
speak to PayPal  about this and that a PayPal advisor shouted at him.
 
PayPal says it looked at Mr Fs complaint and accepts the debt wasnt  his. It says it told both 
the debt collection  company and Mr F that on 29 July 2018. PayPal says it paid Mr F £150 
as a gesture of goodwill  but says it will not pay his lost wages as it was his own choice to 
take that time off work. It does accept there was room for improvement in how its advisor  
dealt with Mr Fs call to it, hence the £150  it paid.
Mr F brought  his complaint to us but our investigator  thought PayPal had already dealt fairly 
with it. She thought  it dealt with the complaint  in a timely manner.. She did think  Mr F 
couldve given better service when he called PayPal, but thought its admission  of this and 
the gesture of goodwill  was fair and reasonable and took this into account. The investigator 
didnt think it reasonable that PayPal pay Mr Fs lost wages and thought other  options  could 
have been considered.
Mr F doesnt accept that view and says PayPal should pay him £400 for his lost wages and 
£500 in total.
I looked at the complaint and decided I wished further information  from both sides. 
I asked PayPal for any call recordings and to tell me if it told Mr F to await  its call and take 
time off work if needed. PayPal says its not possible to provide the recordings but doesnt 
accept telling Mr F to take time off work or to make himself available for a call back. 
I asked Mr F if anyone  else couldve  taken  the call back, and also when he first contacted 
PayPal about  this, as the letter from the debt collection company was dated  16 July 2018   
over a week before the call with PayPal. Mr F says no-one else was available  to take that 
call and he contacted  PayPal when he read the letter  and doesnt  always  open his mail on 
the day its received.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have also listened to the call between us 
and Mr F in which he sets out his main concerns. Having  done so Ive come to the same 
overall conclusions  as the investigator  for the same  reasons. And I wont  be asking PayPal 
to make any further payment to resolve matters. I realise Mr F will be disappointed by my 
decision and I appreciate how strongly he feels about whats happened.
Ref: DRN88081892There is no question here that a fraudster was able to open an account with PayPal in Mr Fs 
name. I appreciate Mr Fs concerns in those circumstances and how it was possible to do 
so. And I also appreciate  that Mr F wanted  answers  from PayPal to find out if there  was a 
wider fraud involving his details. But Im satisfied that PayPal is also a victim here and I can 
see that Mr F knew the debt wasnt his when he first received the letter.  I also dont think  
PayPal couldve given  Mr F any information about  any other cases  of fraud or debts in his 
name that were not his and not related to PayPal. And I think  on balance if there were other 
cases of fraud in Mr Fs name then he would have been made  aware of them by now, as its 
been some  six months since the problems with PayPal.
I have no doubt  that Mr F was caused  inconvenience in contacting PayPal to try and sort 
matters out. I also dont doubt  that he had to repeat  details of his complaint and go through 
security with PayPal a number of times.  And Im sorry about this. But Im satisfied PayPal 
has accepted  that his complaint could  have been  handled better. And has already paid what  
I think is a fair and reasonable amount of compensation for this.
The main  issue remaining here is that Mr F says he had no other  choice but to take four 
days off work to await PayPals investigation  into what  happened,  and he wants £400 in lost 
wages for this. But I dont  think  PayPal can be held responsible for Mr F deciding  that he 
was going to do this. I think  that was Mr Fs personal choice. I appreciate Mr F says he was 
told to stay by the phone and wait for PayPal to contact it and that PayPal denies telling him 
that. 
Obviously the best way to decide  on this issue is to actually listen  to the call, but PayPal 
hasnt made  it available. This is disappointing,  so instead I have to decide  on all the facts 
and circumstances  what I think is more  likely  to have  been said.  
I think it unlikely that PayPals intention or advice wouldve been for Mr F to take time off 
work to wait for its investigation to be completed .It couldnt have known at that time exactly  
how long it would take, so in theory it would have been asking  him to take time off 
indefinitely. I just dont  think thats likely. 
I believe that Mr F was extremely worried and keen to have matters resolved urgently, which 
is why he made the choice to take the time off work.  But I dont think its likely he was 
advised or told to do so by PayPal. And while the call itself would have been useful to hear, I 
dont need to listen to it to make that finding. Further, it wouldnt be fair for me to 
automatically accept Mr Fs contrary evidence simply because  I dont have the call. Not 
when I have other evidence I can base my finding  on.
I accept that Mr F says he couldnt take a phone  into his place  of work, or perhaps that he 
couldnt hear it ring. But I think  he couldve considered reasonable  alternatives  such  as 
calling PayPal back, if it had left a message, when he finished work. I can see that Mr F did 
call PayPal in the evenings in any event. So overall  I dont  think  PayPal should pay for Mr 
Fs lost wages for the time he took off work. 
Ref: DRN88081893my final decision
My final decision is that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie ,SCA has already paid a fair and 
reasonable amount of compensation in the form of a gesture of goodwill and I dont  require it 
to do anything further in the circumstances of this complaint..
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2019.
