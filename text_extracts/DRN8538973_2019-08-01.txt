K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid)  was irresponsible to lend 
to him.
background
Mr S had 36 loans from QuickQuid between November 2013  and March  2018 as can be 
seen in the loan summary  at the end of this document.
Mr S says he struggled to repay the loans so took out additional loans with other  lenders to 
make the repayments.  He says he became reliant  on the loans and couldnt  pay priority bills. 
Mr S adds that QuickQuid  should  have looked  further into his finances  before lending to him.
QuickQuid says that Mr Ss pattern of borrowing  did not suggest he was dependent on the 
loans. It says it wasnt told of any financial hardship  until June 2018, after which  it didnt 
issue any further loans.  QuickQuid adds that it asked Mr S for information about  his income 
and expenditure  and found he had enough disposable income to afford the repayments.  It 
says Mr Ss credit file did not indicate  he was in financial difficulties.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. He considered  that the 
pattern of lending itself showed the loans were unsustainable from the top-up  to loan 6 
onwards. He said QuickQuid should refund interest and charges (plus 8% statutory  interest) 
on the loan 6 top-up to loan 36. He added that it should remove  all entries about those loans 
from Mr Ss credit  file.
QuickQuid responded  to say, in summary, that it couldnt see that Mr Ss bank statements 
had been reviewed. It said that Mr S repaid 26 of his loans early  which  did not suggest 
financial difficulty and his pattern of borrowing  showed he wasnt dependent on the loans. 
QuickQuid said each  loan needed to be assessed individually before it could be concluded 
the lending was unsustainable.
QuickQuid went on to say that it had carried  out enhanced checks for loans from 2015  
onwards and validated Mr Ss income and expenditure for those loans. However,  it offered to 
refund interest  and charges  on loans 30 and 36.
Mr S did not accept this offer.
my provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to QuickQuid and Mr S on 27 June  2019.  I summarise my 
findings here:
I was satisfied QuickQuid did proportionate checks before approving loans 1 and 2 
and would have  found them to be affordable;
Mr S struggled to repay loan 2, so I considered  QuickQuid should have carried out a 
full financial review  before approving loan 3. It didnt  do this, but I was satisfied  there 
was a significant risk Mr S would have been  unable to sustainably  meet  his 
repayments for this loan.  So I didnt think QuickQuid  should have approved  loan 3.
Given the gap in lending, and the fact that Mr S had repaid loan 3 on time, I found  it 
reasonable for QuickQuid to consider Mr S had recovered from his earlier  financial 
difficulties. Hed declared his disposable income  to be over £900, so I couldnt  
conclude QuickQuid  was wrong  to approve loans 4 or 5.
Ref: DRN85389732Given the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr S, I though it should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, 
by the time Mr S applied for loan 6:
oMr S had, again, had difficulty  repaying  a previous loan meaning three out of 
his first five loans were repaid late;
oFrom  loan 6 onwards  Mr S was provided  with a new loan within  days/weeks  
of settling a previous  one. So QuickQuid ought  to have  realised  it was more 
likely than not Mr S was having to borrow further to cover  the hole repaying 
his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ss indebtedness  
was increasing unsustainably;
oMr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid.  Loan  
36 was taken out over four years  after Mr Ss first. And it was for four times 
the amount.  Mr S had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a 
debt to QuickQuid  over an extended period.
So, my provisional decision was that QuickQuid  should refund interest and charges on loans 
3 and 6 to 36 (plus  8% statutory interest). It should also remove  negative  information about 
loan 3 from Mr Ss credit  file and remove all entries about loans 6 to 36.
QuickQuid responded  to say, in summary, that:
Mr S only incurred  a late fee on loan 2 due to his debit card details needing updating;
There was a break of 130 days between the successful repayment of loan 3 and the 
request for loan 4;
The loan amounts fluctuated and he made  25 payments early;
It advised Mr S of the fact that he may need to save income from previous months in 
order to have sufficient  funds  to pay the final payment;
It is not possible to have made a determination as to the sustainability  of each 
instance of lending that QuickQuid  made  to Mr S without analysing  whether the 
specific repayments for each loan were made  without undue difficulty over the life of 
each loan out of his income and/or savings;
It requested a demonstration  of exactly how and why each loan provided to Mr S was 
unsustainable and what specific  detriment was caused as a result.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
I will address each  of QuickQuids first four points  in turn:
I accept Mr S needed to update his debit  card details, but Im not satisfied that 
explains a delay  of almost two-and-a-half months  before Mr S repaid the amount 
due. Indeed, as a repayment plan was set up for the loan,  I consider  that was a clear 
indication Mr S was struggling financially;
Ive taken into account the break in lending between loans 3 and 4 and, as a result,  
did not uphold  the complaint about loans  4 and 5;
Although the loan amounts fluctuated, there was not a sustained  pattern  of 
decreasing borrowing  which  would have indicated  Mr Ss financial situation  was 
improving. Similarly, Mr S often  borrowed again within  days of making an early  
repayment which does  not suggest  he was managing his finances effectively;
Ref: DRN85389733I acknowledge QuickQuid advised Mr S that he may need  to save  income from 
previous months  in order to make the final payment, but it was still QuickQuids 
responsibility to make  sufficient checks to ensure each loan, as a whole, was 
affordable to him. I cant  see it did this.
With regard to QuickQuids final points, as I explained in the provisional decision, such  
lending is intended  for short-term use. By loan 6, it should have become clear to QuickQuid 
that Mr S was not using the loans  for the purpose  for which they were intended. As such, 
QuickQuid should  have reasonably realised that Mr S did not have the disposable income  
that he declared. So Im satisfied that had it carried out the full financial review that such a 
level of repeated borrowing required, it is likely it would have found Mr S could not 
sustainably repay  36 high-cost  loans, over almost four-and-a-half years.
In summary,  as QuickQuid has not provided  any new or additional information,  I see no 
reason to depart from my provisional decision.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid) 
should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr S paid on loan 3 and loans 6 to 36;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Write  off any unpaid interest and charges  on loan 36, apply the refund to reduce any 
capital outstanding and pay any balance to Mr S; 
Remove any negative  information about loan 3 from Mr Ss credit  file;
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 36 should be removed from 
Mr Ss credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr S a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one. If 
QuickQuid intends  to apply the refund to reduce any outstanding capital balance,  it must do 
so after deducting  the tax.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 September 2019.
