The complaint
Mr C complains that NewDay Ltd irresponsibly allowed him to open two credit card accounts 
and also increased the credit limits which he says was unaffordable.
What happened
Mr C opened two NewDay credit card accounts which I will call M and A. He says the 
accounts were unaffordable from the start and it ought to have been clear to NewDay that he 
was in financial difficulties. Mr C says the lending was irresponsible and that NewDay 
shouldnt have increased the credit limits on the accounts. He says NewDays actions 
caused him stress and would like compensation for whats taken place.
NewDay says the M account was opened in 2017 and Mr C declared an income of £30,000 
a year with an additional household income of £6,000 a year. It says there wasnt any recent 
adverse information on Mr Cs credit file and that he had limited other debts. NewDay says it 
carried out appropriate checks on both applications but accepts it shouldnt have increased 
the credit limit on the A account.
Mr C brought his complaint to us and our investigator upheld the complaint in part. The 
investigator thought Newday had carried out appropriate checks on the M application and 
didnt think there was any recent adverse information on Mr Cs credit file. But the 
investigator thought that by June 2018 there were signs of unaffordability in that Mr C was 
over the credit limit and making minimal payments and so NewDay shouldnt have increased 
the credit limit in October 2018. The investigator thought that NewDay ought to have known 
that when it approved the A application, and so thought that A account lending was 
unaffordable. The investigator recommended interest and charges be refunded on the A 
account and on the M account from October 2018 over and above the then credit limit of 
£1,200.
Mr C hasnt replied to the investigators view.
NewDay accepts part of the investigators view but doesnt accept it made a mistake by 
increasing the M credit limit in October 2018 and says it wouldnt have known about Mr Cs 
income reduction at that stage.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to a similar overall view as the investigator.
Lenders and credit providers should carry out reasonable and proportionate checks on any 
lending or credit application. Those checks will of course vary depending on the type and 
amount of the lending. And I wouldnt have expected NewDays checks to have been as 
detailed here for a credit facility rather than for example a loan or mortgage.
I have looked at NewDays records and can see that it did carry out checks on Mr Cs 
application and that he declared a household income of £36,000 a year. I can also see that 
NewDay checked Mr Cs debt which I think was minimal and that it also checked his credit 
file which I dont think contained any recent adverse information. So, Im satisfied NewDay 
carried out reasonable and proportionate checks on Mr Cs M application and that NewDay 
didnt irresponsibly approve the M application. Im satisfied the lending was affordable for 
that account and that NewDay approved what I think was a modest credit limit of £300.
Im also satisfied NewDay carried out appropriate checks on the first credit limit increase and 
that it was reasonably entitled to consider Mr Cs appropriate management of his account.
I have looked carefully at Mr Cs M account statements in 2018. And I can see that from 
about July 2018 Mr C was making relatively small monthly repayments and had increased 
his spending following the credit limit increase shortly before. I can also see there was an 
over limit fee in July 2018 as well as a late fee in September 2018. So, I think NewDay ought 
reasonably to have considered carefully the credit limit offer in October 2018 and carried out 
further checks before offering the limit increase. Im satisfied that there were obvious signs of 
unaffordability at that stage and further checks would have shown a change in Mr Cs 
circumstances. I dont think the increase was affordable at that time and further checks 
would have shown that.
It follows that as I dont think NewDay acted fairly by increasing the credit limit on the M 
account in October 2018 then I also think the decision to allow the A account to be opened 
was irresponsible and the account was unaffordable from the start.
Im satisfied that Mr C has had the benefit of the lending and so it would be unfair to order 
NewDay to write off the balances. I also dont think in the circumstances this complaint 
justifies compensation as Im satisfied the original lending decision and first credit limit 
increase was affordable. 
Putting things right
NewDay should refund all interest and charges on the A account and deduct that amount 
from the balance owed by Mr C. NewDay should refund all interest and charges on the M 
account charged following the credit limit increase in October 2018 on the balance over the 
existing credit limit at the time of £1,200. 
I dont think it likely that any refund will result in a payment back to Mr C as I think it likely 
any refund would be less than the balances he owes. But if there is an overpayment due to 
him then we would normally order that interest be paid at 8% and also order that he be given 
a certificate confirming any tax deducted from that amount. I make clear to NewDay that if 
there is such an overpayment due then it should pay interest as set out. NewDay should also 
remove any adverse information from Mr Cs credit file in respect of the A account.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I order NewDay Ltd to refund any 
interest and charges on the A account and remove any information about it from Mr Cs 
credit file. I also order NewDay to refund any interest and charges on the M account from 
October 2018 incurred over and above the existing credit limit at the time of £1,200. And it 
should pay interest on any refund at 8% simple interest if there is an overpayment due to Mr 
C.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 September 2021.
