K822xComplaint
Mr A complains that Stagemount Limited (trading as Quidmarket) was irresponsible in its 
lending to him.
Background 
Based on the information provided, Quidmarket  provided Mr A with eleven loans between  
May 2014 and October 2017.
Loan Date Repaid Instalments Amount
1 20/5/2014 30/5/ 2014 1 £150.00
2 08/06/2014 27/06/2014 1 £150.00
3 11/07/201
425/07/2014 1 £150.00
4 04/08/2014 29/08/2014 1 £150.00
5 07/09/2014 26/09/2014 1 £150.00
6 30/09/2014 31/10/2014 1 £225.00
7 03/11/2014 28/11/2014 1 £300.00
8 21/12/2014 30/01/2015 1 £150.00
9 06/02/2015 27/02/2015 11 £300.00
10 02/03/2015 24/04/2015 2 £350.00
11 20/10/2017 3 £300.00
Mr A says that at the time of the loans  he was borrowing from a number of other  short term 
loan providers and was borrowing to make his repayments. He says that had adequate 
checks been carried out Quidmarket would have  realised  he was in financial difficulty. He 
says the loans made his situation  worse  and have caused him stress.
Quidmarket says that before the loans  were provided adequate credit  worthiness checks  
were carried  out. They  say these relied on information provided by Mr A as well as other 
external sources.  In their final response letter  they noted that the amount Mr A borrowed 
increased at the seventh loan and that this loan was applied for shortly  after loan six was 
repaid. They  say that they could have carried  out further checks  at this point to ensure the 
loan was affordable.  Although they say they cannot  know what further  checks  would have 
shown they offered to provide redress on loans seven to nine (including the roll over of loan 
eight). Quidmarket says that loans ten and eleven  were a different product with lower 
monthly repayments and they thought the correct checks were carried  out before  these  
loans were provided.
Our adjudicator said that there was a substantial gap between when loan ten was repaid and 
loan eleven provided. Because of this she said the loans fell into two lending  chains. The 
first consisting of loans  one to ten and the second consisting of loan eleven.
Our adjudicator didn't think  she had seen  enough  to say that it was unfair to provide loans 
one to five or loan eleven. However  she thought  that by loan six Mr A was showing signs  
that he was struggling  to make some of his repayments and she thought this showed  a 
significant risk that he wouldn't be able to sustainably make his repayments.
Ref: DRN03553972By loan seven, our adjudicator thought Mr A's overall pattern of borrowing showed that he 
was persistently reliant on short term loans. So she recommended the remaining loans  in 
this lending chain  be upheld.
Quidmarket said that they had originally  made  an offer in regard to loans seven to nine but 
didn't accept that this complaint should  be upheld from loan five. They  said loan ten was an 
instalment loan and so the repayments required  were lower than on previous loans.
Quidmarket also challenged the suggestion of all information being removed in regard to the 
upheld loans.
My provisional conclusions
I issued a provisional decision in regard to this complaint. I concluded  in summary:
the significant gap between when  loan ten was repaid and loan eleven provided  meant  
the loans fell into two lending chain  with the first consisting of loans one to ten and the 
second consisting of loan eleven;
there wasnt enough evidence to say that loans one to five shouldn't have been provided;
before  loan six was provided a full review  of Mr A's financial situation should  have taken 
place. However, had this happened, I found  there  wasnt  enough evidence to say this 
loan shouldn't have been provided;
by loan seven,  Mr A's overall pattern of borrowing  showed  that he was persistently reliant 
on short  term loans. Mr A had taken out seven loans in less than six months  and the 
amounts weren't showing a pattern of decline and were, in general,  increasing. Mr A was 
taking out new loans shortly after repaying previous loans and I thought this suggested 
he was not able to sustainably repay his loans. Because of this thought that loans seven 
to ten shouldnt have been  provided;
loan eleven  was taken out after a substantial break and was therefore  the first loan in a 
new lending chain,  and I didnt  have enough  evidence to say this loan shouldn't  have 
been provided.
Quidmarket challenged  the recommendation of removing loans entirely  from Mr A's credit  
file. However, given the number of loans Mr A had been provided by loan seven, any 
information about these was adverse. Therefore in regard to loans  seven to ten I found  it fair 
that all information  was removed from his credit  file.
Mr A responded to my provisional decision.  He said that although there was a break in his 
borrowing from Quidmarket he was borrowing from other lenders during that period  and that 
Quidmarket should  have realised this. Quidmarket  didnt respond to my provisional  decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Ref: DRN03553973Quidmarket needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that they didn't lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that they should  have carried out proportionate checks  to make sure that 
Mr A could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumer's  income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Quidmarket should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. There  may even 
come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending  itself clearly demonstrates that 
the lending was unsustainable.
As I set out in my provisional  decision, I dont think there is enough evidence to say that 
loans one to five shouldnt have been provided.  Further checks  should  have taken  place 
before loan six was provided, however had these taken place I dont find I have  enough 
evidence to say that this loan shouldnt have been  provided. Mr As pattern of borrowing 
from loan seven suggests a reliance on short term lending and I find that loans seven to ten 
shouldnt have been provided.
Loan eleven was part of a new lending chain and I dont find I have enough evidence to say 
this loan shouldnt  have been provided.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complain  in regard to loans seven to ten. Stagemount 
Limited (trading as Quidmarket)  should:
A)add together  the total of the repayments made  by Mr A towards interest,  fees and 
charges on all upheld  loans not including  anything that has already been refunded;
B)calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made  by Mr A which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Mr A originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled;
C)pay Mr A the total of "A" and "B";
D)the overall pattern of Mr As borrowing  for loans seven to ten means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so these loans should be removed entirely from 
Mr As credit file.
Mr A still has an outstanding amount due in regard  to loan 11. I find it reasonable that the 
refund can be used to offset the amount outstanding with any surplus being paid to Mr A.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Stagemount  Limited (trading as Quidmarket)  to take off 
tax from this interest. They must give Mr A a certificate showing how much tax theyve taken 
off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 February  2020.
