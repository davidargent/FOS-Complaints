K822xcomplaint
Mr C complains that PDL Finance Limited  (trading  as Mr Lender)  lent him money with 
carrying out adequate affordability  checks.
Mr C wants Mr Lender to refund the loans that he took out.
background
Mr C took out ten loans  with Mr Lender between July October  2010  and October  2014.  A 
summary of his lending  is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Repayment date Loan amount
Repayment amount 
1 20/08/10 29/10/10 £300.00 £375.00
2 12/12/12 21/12/12 £200.00 £260.00
3 21/12/12 25/01/13 £550.00 £715.00
4 25/01/13 28/03/13 £650.00 £845.00
5 26/04/13 31/05/13 £300.00 £390.00
6 23/01/14 31/01/14 £200.00 £230.00
7 01/02/14 28/03/14 £950.00 £1235.00
8 09/04/14 25/04/14 £500.00 £650.00
9 16/05/14 27/06/14 £600.00 £780.00
10 27/06/14 14/10/14 £950.00 £1187.50
Mr C says that he couldnt afford to repay  the loans and was having to take out other payday 
loans to keep  up with his repayments.
The adjudicator recommended that Mr Cs complaint be upheld in part. Given the breaks in 
lending, the adjudicator considered the loans in three separate  chains.
The adjudicator recommended that Mr Lender  refund  interest and charges on loans  seven to 
ten and pay interest  on the refund. She also recommended that Mr Lender  remove  any 
negative information  about loans seven  to ten from Mr Cs credit  file.
When Mr Lender  first responded to the adjudicators  recommendation, it offered to put things 
right for loans nine and ten. As loans seven and eight remained in dispute, the complaint 
came to me. But within the last few days, Mr Lender has accepted  the rest of the 
adjudicators recommendation.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that  
Mr C could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. 
Ref: DRN50252882These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay him loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because first the OFTs Irresponsible  Lending  Guidance  and later the 
FCAs Consumer Credit  Sourcebook defines  sustainable as being  without undue difficulties 
and in particular  the customer should  be able to make repayments on time while  meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments.
So it follows  that a lender  should realise  or it ought  fairly and reasonably  to realise,  that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if its likely  they will need to 
borrow further to repay their loans.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
Mr C hasnt raised any objection to the adjudicators  recommendation in relation to loans one 
to six  the loans  she didnt  uphold.  It seems to me that these loans arent  in dispute, so I 
dont consider I need to say anything more  about them.
Since starting to draft my decision,  Mr Lender has offered to put things right for loans seven 
and eight (in addition to loans nine and ten). So I dont consider that I now need to explain 
further why I agree with the adjudicators recommendation to uphold  Mr Cs complaint about  
these loans. 
Ref: DRN50252883putting things right - what  Mr Lender  needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges that Mr C paid on loans seven  to ten
pay interest of 8% simple  a year * on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement; and
remove any negative information  loans seven to ten from Mr Cs credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires PDL Finance Limited to take off tax from this interest. 
It must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. To put things right,  PDL Finance 
Limited (trading as Mr Lender) should take the steps  outlined  above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 April 2020.
