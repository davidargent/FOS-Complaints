The complaint
Mr D complains that Capital One (Europe) plc (CapOne) declined his application for a new 
credit card with a balance transfer.
What happened 
In August 2022, Mr D received an invitation to apply for a pre-approved credit card with a 
limit of Â£3,500. He wanted to use the card for a balance transfer.
CapOne asked him for more information and then declined the application.
Mr D complained. He said that CapOne acted in a manner that was opaque, capricious, and 
poorly communicated. The pre-approved offer said one more step..  which implied the 
process would be simple. He said he provided his income details and had a perfect credit 
score  and couldnt see why the application was declined. He wanted to use the balance 
transfer to manage his cash flow  as hed done on many occasions before with other credit 
card providers.
Mr D made a Subject Access Request (SAR) on 21 September 2022, and CapOne supplied 
its response on 6 October 2022. Mr D then asked for calls under the SAR request  on 19 
December 2022; CapOne provided these on 5 January 2023.
Mr D said CapOne had breached the Financial Conduct Authoritys (FCA) Four Principles 
and hadnt satisfied his SAR request  because theyd not provided him with the calls.
CapOne said their Quick Check tool provided an indication of acceptance, but once a full 
application is considered, other elements may affect the final decision. They said CapOnes 
lending criteria is confidential, and theres no guarantee of being accepted, even if theres no 
adverse credit history. And in Mr Ds case he didnt meet CapOnes lending criteria.
Mr D brought his complaint to us. Our investigator didnt uphold it. He said CapOnes lending 
criteria was confidential and he cant interfere with CapOnes commercial judgment. He 
didnt consider that Mr Ds request for a SAR had not been dealt with properly.
Mr D didnt agree. He repeated his complaint points and added:
- CapOne breached the FCAs Four Principles for Business.
- He didnt think automated processing was fair.
- Pre-approved gave the direction that the credit card was approved  there werent 
any caveats or conditions to it.
- His credit score had now been affected because of the searches performed by 
CapOne.
Mr D asked that an ombudsman looks at his complaint, and so it has come to me to make a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We asked CapOne for more information about the pre-approved offer. I wanted to know 
more about the offer and how it was communicated  as that is the crux of Mr Ds complaint. 
CapOne told us:
Mr Ds pre-approved application came via a price comparison website (PCW). He was 
prompted to apply by the PCW. CapOne cant say how Mr D came to be targeted by that 
business; possibly because he had applied for credit that way in the past. 
CapOne showed us what Mr D wouldve seen on the price comparison website  it said 
Your chance of approval  100%...youll get this card if you applybeing pre-approved 
means the interest rate, interest-free period and feeare all confirmed. The only thing we 
cant guarantee is the credit limit  this will be confirmed after you apply. Youre guaranteed 
to get this card, provided you use the same details as you gave us and you pass the lenders 
final credit checks, including fraud and money laundering.
So - while I agree the PCW broadly indicated the card should be approved, it did give a 
caveat that it was subject to CapOnes credit checks  which is understandable.
In fairness to CapOne, I cant hold them responsible for what the PCW puts on its website  
Mr D may wish to approach the PCW.
And then, when Mr D clicked through to CapOnes website, he was given the message:
..we still need tocheck your eligibility again with the credit reference agencies and 
let them know youve applied for a credit card. This will go on your credit file.
Do our fraud and identity checks.(because of these checks) theres a small chance 
we wont be able to open your account.
So here, clearly its for CapOne to take its own decisions on whether to agree a credit limit or 
not. And Im satisfied the text that CapOne showed Mr D said the card was subject to their 
checks.
And in this case, its for CapOne to take its own commercial decisions about whether to give 
Mr D a new credit card and limit, based on its own lending criteria. Thats for CapOne to 
decide  and we wont interfere with that. 
I can see that CapOne assessed Mr Ds application and declined it based on their own 
lending criteria  and as Ive said thats not something I can challenge.
Mr D has said his credit score has been affected. But every lender will carry out a credit 
search when a customer applies for a credit limit (as was the case here). And  lenders must 
record the search as a matter of fact. So  thats whats happened here, and I dont think 
thats an unreasonable thing for CapOne to have done. And  CapOnes communications 
did say the application would be recorded on Mr Ds credit file.
Similarly, the use of automated approval processes is for CapOne to decide upon. We cant tell businesses to change their operations, processes, or procedures  thats up to them, and 
we cant interfere. But  it is a fact that all (or at least most) credit card providers use such 
processes today.
Ive gone on to consider what Mr D has said about the SAR request. I noted that he asked 
for a SAR on 21 September 2022, and CapOne supplied its response on 6 October 2022. 
So, that was within the regulatory timescale of 30 days. Mr D then asked for calls on 19 
December 2022; CapOne provided these on 5 January 2023. So that was also within a 
further 30-day timescale. Mr D argues that the provision of calls shouldve been fulfilled in 
the first response  and by the time the calls were provided, that was outside the original 30-
day period. But on that point  I note he is going to complain to the Information 
Commissioners Office (ICO) and therefore that point  a technical one  is better handled by 
the ICO. So, I make no further comment on that.
I can see that Mr D feels strongly about his complaint and so will be disappointed by my 
decision, but Im not asking CapOne to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 November 2023.
