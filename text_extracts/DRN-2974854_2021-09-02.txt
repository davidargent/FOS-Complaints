The complaint
Miss H is unhappy with the service that shes received from PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA, surrounding a reimbursement from a cancelled holiday.   
What happened
Miss H purchased a holiday for approximately £643 using her PayPal account on which her 
bank debit card was registered. The holiday was later cancelled by the merchant and the 
£643 was reimbursed to Miss Hs PayPal account. 
Following this, the £643 was returned by PayPal to the originating bank account to which the 
debit card on her PayPal account was linked. However, in the interim, Miss H had closed the 
bank account from which the money had been taken, so Miss Hs bank returned the money 
back to PayPal. Unfortunately, PayPal didnt receive the returned money, and neither the 
Bank or PayPal have any record of where Miss Hs £643 now sits. Miss H wasnt happy 
about this, so she raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Miss Hs complaint, but they felt that they could evidence that the money 
had been returned to the Bank, so they advised Miss H to pursue the matter with her bank 
and didnt uphold the complaint. 
Miss H wasnt happy with PayPals response, especially as her bank were saying that they 
could evidence that the money had been returned to PayPal and were advising Miss H to 
pursue the matter with PayPal. So, she referred her complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. They felt that PayPal and Miss Hs bank 
had equally compelling evidence to suggest that the other party was at fault. So, our 
investigator recommended that PayPal reimburse to Miss H half of the money that was 
missing - £321.50  along with 8% simple interest calculated from 21 May 2020, which was 
the date our investigator felt that Miss H ought reasonably to have received the 
reimbursement in the first instance, to whenever the payment was made. Our investigator 
also recommended that PayPal should make a further payment of £75 to Miss H to 
compensate her for any trouble and upset she may have incurred.
PayPal didnt agree to the recommendation put forward by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.   
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, it seems apparent to me that both PayPal and Miss Hs bank have equally 
compelling claims that Miss Hs money must reside with the other party. What is certain is 
that Miss H has expended a great deal of time and energy into trying to recover the £643 
that, I can only conclude at this point, given the evidence that Ive seen, has been effectively 
lost. 
This doesnt feel fair to me, so I will be upholding this complaint against PayPal and 
instructing them to make a payment to Miss H of £321.50  half of £643  along with 8% 
simple interest calculated from 21 May 2020 - which I accept as being the date that Miss H 
ought reasonably to have received the reimbursement in the first instance  to the date that 
the payment to Miss H is made. 
I will also be instructing PayPal to make a further payment of £75 to Miss H to compensate 
her for any trouble and upset that shes incurred here.  
Putting things right
PayPal must make a payment to Miss H of £321.50 along with 8% simple interest calculated 
from 21 May 2020 to the date that the payment to Miss H is made. 
PayPal must also make a further payment to Miss H of £75    
My final decision
I uphold this complaint against PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie on the basis explained above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 September 2021.
