The complaint
Mr B complains that Monzo Bank Ltd (Monzo) wont refund him after he fell victim to a 
scam.
What happened
Mr B is represented in this case but for ease Ill refer to Mr B throughout this decision. 
Mr B has had an account with Monzo since 2019. In around December 2022 Mr B used a 
dating website and received a message from someone Ill refer to as O in this decision. They 
exchanged messages daily and quickly developed a relationship and discussed plans to be 
together. After messaging for around two weeks O introduced Mr B to investing as a way to 
build a secure life together. O gave the impression he had a lot of investment experience.
Mr B initially transferred £1,000 from an account with a different firm and was able to see his 
funds on a trading platform. In a few days Mr B made a profit of £300 and was encouraged 
to continue to invest. Each time Mr B invested funds O guided him through the process and 
told him who to buy cryptocurrency from through a peer to peer platform and where to 
transfer it. 
Mr B had access to a platform and could see that he was making good profits. When Mr B 
wanted to withdraw funds, he was advised of a 10% fee which amounted to around £50,000. 
O put him under pressure to make this payment and said that his funds were tied in with Mr 
Bs and could only be released at the same time as Mr Bs. 
I have listed in the table below all the payments Mr B made from his Monzo account:

Mr B realised something wasnt right when he encountered difficulties in withdrawing his 
funds and reported the scam to Monzo on 21 January 2023. Monzo considered Mr Bs claim 
but didnt agree to a refund. It said it provided Mr B with warnings and he didnt take enough 
steps to satisfy himself the investment opportunity was genuine. 
Mr B wasnt happy with Monzos response and brought a complaint to this service. He said 
that Monzo should have picked up on the fact he made multiple payments over a very short 
timeframe and set up multiple new payees. 
Our investigation so far
The investigator who considered this complaint recommended that it be upheld in part. He 
said Monzo should have asked Mr B questions when the fifth payment in the table above 
was made and had it done so the scam would have been uncovered. By this payment Mr B 
would have transferred almost £10,000 to three new beneficiaries in 31 minutes and he had 
transferred £6,000 to one individual in two transactions. But as Mr B didnt complete any 
checks and was offered a huge and guaranteed rate of return, he should receive 50% of 
payment five onwards, plus interest. 
Mr B accepted the investigators findings, but Monzo did not. In summary, it said:
- There was nothing concerning about the payments for it to flag. The balance of Mr 
Bs account remained high and in the week prior to the scam Mr B made transfers of 
£7,475 and £5,405.
- Theres nothing to say Mr B would have told Monzo the truth about his relationship or 
the investment if it had asked questions.
- Mr B didnt do enough to protect himself  he completed no due diligence and the 
deal offered was unrealistic.
- The payments from Mr Bs Monzo account were legitimate payments for 
cryptocurrency which Mr B received. The loss occurred when Mr B transferred 
cryptocurrency to the scammer, and this isnt Monzos responsibility.
The complaint has been passed to me to consider. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to say how sorry I was to hear about what has happened to Mr B. The person Mr B 
thought he was building a future with turned out to be a cruel scammer. I recognise the huge 
impact the scam has had on Mr B. Mr Bs representative has referred to Monzos obligations under the CRM Code and 
otherwise. But the CRM Code doesnt apply in this case because it only applies to a transfer 
of funds executed across faster payments between GBP accounts in certain circumstances. 
In this case, Mr B made faster payments to various individuals to buy cryptocurrency which 
he transferred to the scammer. The sending of cryptocurrency isnt a faster payment 
between two GBP accounts as required by the CRM Code. 
In broad terms, the starting position in law is that Monzo is expected to process payments 
and withdrawals that a customer authorises it to make, in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the customers account. Its not disputed that Mr B made and authorised these 
payments, although I accept that when he did so he didnt think his funds were at risk.
However, taking into account the law, regulators rules and guidance, relevant codes of 
practice and what I consider to have been good industry practice at the time, I consider 
Monzo should fairly and reasonably:
In this case, I need to decide whether Monzo acted fairly and reasonably in its dealings with 
Mr B when he authorised payments from his account or whether it could and should have 
done more before processing them. 
Monzo has provided Mr Bs bank statements from 1 August 2022. Ive reviewed them 
carefully to consider whether the scam transactions were in line with Mr Bs normal account 
activity. Having done so, Im satisfied that for the first four payments Monzo didnt need to do 
anything more than provide a new payee and generalised warning as it did each time Mr B 
created a new payee. The transactions were for a lower amount than previous transactions 
on the account. For example, on 5 and 6 January 2023 Mr B made two faster payments of 
£5,405 and £7,475  one to an individual and the other to a company (£7,475). So, although 
Mr B created some new payees, Im satisfied that the first four payments in the table above 
wouldnt have caused Monzo any particular concern and that the generalised scam warnings 
it provided went far enough. 
I agree with the investigator though that by the time Mr B made the payment of £4,000 on 11 
January 2023 Monzo ought reasonably to have done more to satisfy itself Mr B wasnt at risk 
of financial harm. By this stage, over the course of around forty minutes, Mr B had set up 
three new payees and sought to transfer nearly £10,000 from his account. There was also a 
pattern of spending common to investment scams with the value of the transactions rising. 
Im satisfied that at this stage Monzo should have asked Mr B some questions around the 
purpose of the payment and who was helping him with the investment.
I consider that if Monzo had asked Mr B the kind of questions I think it should have Mr B 
would have questioned the level of trust he placed in O and not made further payments. Im 
aware that at a later stage O told Mr B not to mention cryptocurrency to his bank but he 
wasnt coached to say the payment was for anything other than an investment. I consider 
Monzo should have asked Mr B about how he found out about the investment and whether Have been monitoring accounts and any payments made or received to counter 
various risks, including anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, 
and preventing fraud and scams.
Have had systems in place to look out for unusual transactions or other signs that 
might indicate that its customers were at risk of fraud (among other things). This is 
particularly so given the increase in sophisticated fraud and scams in recent years, 
which banks are generally more familiar with than the average customer.
In some circumstances, irrespective of the payment channel used, have taken 
additional steps, or made additional checks, before processing a payment, or in 
some cases declined to make a payment altogether, to help protect customers from 
the possibility of financial harm from fraud.anyone was helping him with it. I see no reason why Mr B wouldnt have said that O was 
helping him, that theyd never met in person and had only been chatting for a short period of 
time. Monzo should have been able to identify common features of a romance/investment 
scam.
Ive gone on to consider whether Mr B should share responsibility for his loss from the point 
at which I consider Monzo should have done more. On balance, I think he should and will 
explain why.
I appreciate that Mr B thought hed found a long-term partner who wanted to build a future 
with him. But I consider he placed a huge amount of trust in someone he had never met and 
had only recently exchanged messages with. Mr B had spoken to O but had not had a video 
call and had no reason to believe that O was who he said he was. After reading the 
messages Mr B and O exchanged its clear that Mr B followed Os instructions without 
raising concerns or questioning what he was doing. 
Ive not seen any evidence that Mr B completed any research of his own to check the 
legitimacy of what he was told. And I think the kind of returns Mr B was offered were too 
good to be true and ought to led him to be more cautious. 
Overall, whilst Im sorry to hear about this scam and the impact it has had on Mr B, I cant 
fairly ask Monzo to refund him in full. Monzo should settle the claim as set out below. 
My final decision
For the reasons stated, I require Monzo Bank Ltd to:
- Refund 50% of all scam payments from and including payment five in the table 
above.
- Pay interest on the above amount at the rate of 8% simple per year from the date of 
each transaction to the date of settlement. 
If Monzo Bank Limited considers it is required by HM Revenue and Customs to take off 
income tax from the 8% simple interest award, it should tell Mr B how much it has taken off. 
It should also give Mr B a certificate showing this if he asks for one, so he can reclaim tax 
from HM Revenue and Customs if appropriate.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 November 2023.
