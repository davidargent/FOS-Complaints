K820x#14complaint
Mr W is unhappy that National Westminster  Bank  Plc blocked his card when he was trying to 
purchase a holiday.  Hes also unhappy  with the service he received when he contacted  
NatWest about this issue, and that they didnt send him a text to tell him his card was 
blocked.
background
On 10 December 2018, Mr W attempted  to purchase a holiday for him and his wife. The 
transaction didnt  go through.  Mr W has said he thought this was a problem with the website 
at the time. Hes also said he had a credit card he couldve  used, but because he thought it 
was a problem  with the website, he didnt think to use it.
Mr Ws said he didnt  receive any contact from NatWest until around 2pm the following day, 
11 December 2018. Following this contact, he got in touch with them,  and said he was 
passed around to three different people. Hes said each  time he had to go through  security  
again, and was on the phone for a long time.
The third person Mr W spoke to at NatWest  was in the complaints team,  and following their 
conversation NatWest wrote out to him in a letter of the same day.
NatWest said a restriction was placed  on Mr Ws card as a fraud prevention measure.  They 
said theres an increasing risk of fraud,  and theyve a number of measures to combat this. 
Mr W had complained on the phone call that NatWest didnt text him, and he didnt 
understand why. They  said their system  didnt send  him a text because it had detected 
Mr Ws mobile phone may be compromised.
NatWest did accept theyd  given Mr W poor service though.  And paid him £4.05 to cover any 
call charges, and £80 compensation for the inconvenience and embarrassment the 
restriction caused.
Mr W wasnt happy with this, and asked us to look into his complaint. Our adjudicator looked 
into matters and didnt  uphold Mr Ws complaint. In summary, she said:
The terms and conditions of Mr Ws account  say NatWest can stop a transaction.
She felt NatWests explanation of why they didnt text him was reasonable.
Shed  seen evidence which showed NatWest had tried to call Mr W that day, and left 
him a voicemail, so she couldnt  fault NatWest for him not hearing from them.
She felt the service  Mr W had on 11 December  2018 was poor, but the compensation 
to recognise the impact  was fair.
Mr W didnt agree. He said he didnt hear from NatWest  until 18 hours  later. And theyd  told 
him this on the phone, so any suggestion of them trying to get in touch with him the same 
day was wrong. Because of this, the complaints been passed to me to decide.
Ref: DRN38248492my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not going to uphold 
Mr Ws complaint,  which I know  will be disappointing for him. Ill explain why.
blocking Mr Ws card
The terms and conditions  of Mr Ws account  say, amongst other things:
We may suspend, restrict or stop access to your account or to certain  services  (such as your 
debit card or online banking)  if:
we reasonably suspect that your security details or your debit card have been used 
fraudulent or without  your permission
So while Mr W isnt happy NatWest blocked  his card, Im satisfied they were entitled  to do so 
if they reasonably  suspected his card couldve been used fraudulently.  Ive not seen  
anything to suggest they were wrong to do so in Mr Ws case.
attempts to contact  Mr W following the declined transaction
Mr W was unhappy NatWest didnt  text him immediately following the declined transaction. 
And he disputed NatWest attempted to contact  him the same day. He said he was at home,  
and didnt see any voicemails until the following day. He also said NatWest told him on the 
phone they hadnt called  him.
The explanation from NatWest for not texting him was that their systems  detected  a different 
phone. NatWest explained this is something  fraudsters are known  to do, which  is why they 
didnt send him a text. So while Mr W isnt happy  with this explanation,  Im satisfied from the 
evidence Ive seen  that it reasonably explains why they didnt text him. 
Ive listened to the call Mr W had with the complaints team on 11 December 2018, and in this 
call I didnt hear them say they hadnt  tried to call him. However,  Mr W is adamant  the only 
call or voicemail he received from NatWest was around 2pm on 11 December 2018. 
NatWests evidence shows  three calls attempted on 10 December, and a further call around 
1.47pm on 11 December. This appears  to be the call Mr W received. I cant know why the 
other calls NatWest made didnt connect, but overall  Im satisfied they did attempt to reach  
Mr W after the transaction was declined.
service Mr W received
NatWest accepted Mr W shouldnt have been passed through to the complaints department  
without being  introduced   and that Mr W had been on the phone  a long time. They said 
theyd pay £4.05  to cover call costs, with a further  £80 compensation into Mr Ws account. I 
can see this has been refunded to Mr W. Overall  Im satisfied the compensation fairly 
recognises the impact  that this had on him and so Im not going to tell them  to do anymore.
Ref: DRN38248493my final decision
For the reasons  Ive set out above  it follows I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 April 2019.
