The complaint
A limited company, which Ill refer to as N, is unhappy with the service it received from 
National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) surrounding a request to set up a standing order 
to make payments to its Bounce Back Loan (BBL), including not being able to set up a 
standing order on NatWests mobile banking app.
Ns complaint is brought to this service by its director, whom Ill refer to as Mr R.
What happened
In May 2022, Mr R telephoned NatWest and made a payment to clear arrears that had 
developed on Ns BBL. Mr R also asked NatWest to set up a standing order to make the 
scheduled monthly payments towards Ns BBL moving forwards. 
The NatWest agent Mr R spoke with directed Mr R to NatWests online banking platform to 
set up the standing order. But when Mr R tried to set up a standing order for N, he was 
unable to do so. Mr R wasnt happy about this and felt that his being unable to set up a 
standing order for N had caused Ns BBL to fall into a position of arrears once again. So, he 
raised a complaint on Ns behalf.
NatWest said they had no record of Mr R asking them to set up a standing order for N, but 
that their records did indicate that Mr R had said that he would set up a standing order for N 
himself. As such, NatWest didnt feel that theyd acted unfairly towards N and so didnt 
uphold Ns complaint. Mr R wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred Ns 
complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel there was anything in 
the information available to them that corroborated Mr Rs claim that hed asked NatWest to 
set up a standing order for N. And they also felt that Mr R could and should have made 
payments towards the BBL for N via other channels if the standing order wasnt set up as he 
wanted when the BBL payments were due. Mr R remained dissatisfied, so the matter was 
escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Id like to begin by confirming that this service isnt a regulatory body or a 
Court of Law and doesnt operate as such. This means that it isnt within my remit here to 
declare that NatWest have acted in a non-regulatory or unlawful way. 
Instead, this service is an informal, impartial dispute resolution service. And while we do take 
relevant law and regulation into account when arriving at our decisions, our remit is focussed 
on determining whether we feel a fair or unfair outcome has occurred  from an impartial 
perspective, after taking all the circumstances and factors of a complaint into consideration. 
When referring his complaint to this service, Mr R has explained that hed like the adverse 
credit file reporting that resulted from N not making the payments towards its BBL because 
NatWest didnt set up the standing order as he requested to be removed from Ns credit file.
This isnt an instruction Id consider issuing here, given the circumstances of this complaint, 
and this is because I feel that it remained incumbent on N to make the payments required of 
it on the BBL regardless of whether a standing order had been set up or not. And, given that 
Mr R called NatWest in May 2022 and made a payment to clear the arrears by telephone at 
that time, I see no reason why Mr R couldnt have met Ns payment obligations in a similar 
fashion for the later months when the standing order wasnt yet set up. 
As such, Im satisfied that the missed BBL payments that were reported to Ns credit file for 
the months of August and September 2022  at a time when a standing order to make Ns 
monthly payments hadnt been set up  do accurately reflect what happened on the BBL and 
arent unfair. And so, I wont be instructing NatWest to amend this reporting.
Mr R has explained that when he called NatWest in May 2022 that he asked NatWest to set 
up a standing order for Ns future BBL payments, but that NatWest refused to do so and 
instructed him to set up the standing order himself online. 
Ive listened to a recording of the telephone call that took place in May 2022 and having 
done so its notable that after Mr R makes the payment to clear the arrears on Ns BBL, he 
then asks the following: I was wondering when the next payment is due so that I can set up 
a standing order?.
Accordingly, Im satisfied that it wasnt the case that Mr R asked NatWest to set up a 
standing order at that time, but rather that Mr R requested the information from NatWest so 
that he could set up a standing order on Ns behalf himself. And I further note that Mr R was 
then told by NatWests agent the amount of the monthly payment that N was required to 
make towards the BBL and the day of the month the payment was due. 
Mr R also telephoned NatWest a few weeks later, in June 2022, before the next payment 
was due to be paid on Ns BBL. Unfortunately, NatWest dont hold a recording of that call. 
However, the notes input by their agent that took the call dont make any reference to Mr R 
asking NatWest to set up a standing order for N but again indicate that Mr R would be 
setting up a standing order himself. And, given the May 2022 call that I have been able to 
listen to, when Mr R did state that he would set up the standing order for N himself, I feel that 
these notes for the later June 2022 call are more likely than not to be accurate. 
Finally, Mr R has said that when he went online to set up the standing order for N, as 
directed by NatWest, that the functionality to set up a standing order wasnt available. Mr N 
has provided screenshots which he feels confirm this point. But notably, the screenshots that 
Mr N has submitted are from NatWests online banking app  which NatWest confirm doesnt 
include the functionality to set up a standing order  rather than from NatWests online 
banking platform  to which Mr R was directed by NatWests agent and which does include 
the functionality to set up a standing order.
All of which means that I dont feel, from the information available to me, that NatWest have 
done anything wrong here. This is because it seems that Mr R didnt initially ask NatWest to 
set up a standing order as he maintains but instead indicated that he would set up a 
standing order himself. Additionally, when Mr R then attempted to set up a standing order for 
N, it appears that he didnt try to do so via the online banking platform to which he was 
directed, but instead attempted to do so via the mobile banking app to which he wasnt 
directed, and which didnt include the functionality necessary for him to be able to do so.I realise this might not be the outcome Mr R was wanting, but it follows from all the above 
that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action. I 
hope Mr R will understand, given all that Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that 
I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask N to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 July 2023.
