K821x#15complaint
Mrs A complains about the advice she received from Broadleaf  Financial  Services  Ltd about
her late husbands  self invested  personal  pension (SIPP).
background
Mrs A said she was wrongly advised by Broadleaf. She said she shouldve been  advised to 
transfer the money in her husbands  SIPP into a dependant  drawdown account. This 
wouldve allowed her to draw on the money tax free and avoided inheritance tax on the 
remaining fund on her death. Instead  she was advised to take the whole fund and invest  in a 
product that was subject to both income and capital gains tax and also would be part of her 
estate on her death. 
Broadleaf said it made clear it was not a tax expert and advised  Mrs A should  take 
independent taxation advice. It said that when Mr A died it proposed  action to get income in 
a tax efficient manner. It was possible to manage  the new fund to minimise tax.
my provisional decisions
I issued two provisional decisions in this case. In summary I concluded  that Broadleaf did 
make a mistake and neither party disputed this. My decisions therefore focused  on 
measuring the loss.
loss
In making an award of compensation  I needed  to seek  to put Mrs A back  in the position she 
wouldve been in but for the mistake. However  that was not possible.  The transaction  
couldnt be reversed  and it wasnt possible to duplicate the tax free environment that Mrs A 
couldve enjoyed. It was therefore necessary to find an approach  that reflected how Mrs A 
had been made worse  off. This needed  to consider charges, current  and any potential future 
tax liability. 
The adjudicator had proposed a basis to achieve this which  both parties had commented on.
Having considered the assumptions taken and the detail of the calculation proposed by the 
adjudicator I thought that it was a fair and reasonable proposal to calculate  the loss. This 
considered the past and future loss due to the less favourable tax treatment and also the 
additional IHT that might  be payable on death.
Our approach was about considering the likelihood  of future  events and Mrs As age.
I asked Mrs A to provide  a valuation of her estate for IHT purposes.  This would provide a 
determination of how much of the WRAP was likely to be subject to IHT. This showed that 
part of the WRAP  would  most likely  be subject to tax at 40% based on values current at the 
time of the calculation.
Mrs A also decided that she wanted the compensation paid directly to her and not her 
children. 
Both parties  had agreed £500 for distress and inconvenience which I thought was fair and 
reasonable.
Ref: DRN75481152I proposed to uphold  the complaint and direct that Broadleaf  Financial  Services  Ltd should 
pay Mrs A:-
1.£500 for distress  and inconvenience.
2.£1800  for work completed on the valuation of the estate for inheritance  tax purposes.
3.the amount  calculated  to represent the additional  inheritance tax payable  because of 
the WRAP falling within  her estate on death in accordance with the model below 
multiplied by 0.4.
4.the remainder of the payments proposed by the adjudicator to cover  past and future 
loss during Mrs As lifetime as a result  of the WRAP being outside the tax beneficial  
SIPP drawdown environment.
Mrs A said that she estimated the current value of her estate was circa £1.1 million. After 
applying relevant IHT nil rate bands  approximately  £186,000 would be chargeable to 
inheritance tax at 40% creating a liability of around  £75,000. But she pointed  out this award 
would also further  increase the size of her estate and thus the amount of inheritance  
payable. 
She also said that her adviser had considered the amount of additional tax paid in the WRAP 
for the 2015/16,16/17 and 18/19 tax year. This had resulted in additional  tax liabilities  of nil, 
£380.98 and £393.20 respectively. Her adviser  also indicated the cost of providing 
information to value the estate had now increased to £2,500.
Broadleaf was satisfied  that, whilst the redress methodology is complicated, it is not 
unreasonable. However, they added comments on the proposed redress methodology. I 
have responded  to these points and further  points raised by Broadleaf and Mrs A. For the 
sake of brevity these are not set out in this decision.
Broadleaf agreed  to pay the £1800 (inclusive  of VAT) for the estate valuation. But this was 
conditional on Broadleaf  being provided with full details of valuation  (full details of supporting 
documents and any assumptions) and being  able to, reasonably,  challenge / interrogate 
either the estate  valuation  or the IHT allowance calculation.
my provisional decision
While valuation information was provided  to Broadleaf there was a dispute about the value 
attributed to the property. I proposed that three  valuations should be obtained  at the cost of 
Broadleaf. It was asked to confirm its requirements with respect to obtaining valuations of 
the property but failed  to do so. I therefore  proposed  the following approach to the property 
valuation.
1.Mrs A should arrange for three valuations of her main residence to be provided by 
three reputable  independent estate agents who have  knowledge  of the local market 
such valuations to be on the basis of a willing buyer  and seller.
2.The average of these three valuations should  be used to complete the loss 
calculations in the manner used to date.
Ref: DRN754811533.Broadleaf should pay Mrs A for any reasonable costs, charges and expenses made 
by such estate agents in providing  those valuations.
Broadleaf also raised queries  in relation to an offshore bond and these were  answered.  It 
raised queries  about the timing of other valuations but not the evidence provided to support 
those. Given this I think it is reasonable to assume  that the evidence provided is of a type 
that will be adequate  to enable Broadleaf to make the calculations it needs to complete the 
calculations of loss set out below.  Those  valuations will need to be renewed at the time of 
the calculation  of loss. 
The calculation of loss should be done on the basis set out below.
Calculation of loss
IHT on Mrs As death
The sum to be paid is what constitutes  a reasonable estimation of the most likely additional 
IHT liability  Mrs As estate will suffer on her death  as a result  of the transfer  of monies  into 
the WRAP. For the purposes  of calculating this sum it is to be assumed tax rates (personal 
and otherwise) will remain as per the 2019/2020 tax year rates  and relevant tax allowances.
Broadleaf Financial Services Ltd should calculate this most  likely sum by doing  all of the 
following.
1.Premised on the most recent  (and relevant) table for life expectancy, published by 
the Office of National Statistics, ascertain the mean  life expectancy for an individual 
in Mrs As position  (i.e. a female  of her age in good health) as at the date of 
calculation. The residual mean longevity for an individual in Mrs As position will be 
termed XY years hereafter in this letter.
2.Using the value  of the WRAP  calculated to be subject to IHT, ascertain what the 
notional value of this part of the WRAP would be XY years  from the date of 
calculation. In arriving at this sum it should  be assumed that Mrs A will take an 
income of 4% a year from the total WRAP value each year. And that the WRAP value 
will enjoy  growth, over the XY years, equivalent to the discount  rate for a period of 
XY years premised on the latest  assumptions for pension mis-sale  cases  that fall 
outside the Pensions Review.
3.The sum arrived at from steps  1 and 2 above should  be multiplied by 0.4% because 
only 40% of that sum would suffer IHT as part of Mrs As estate. This amount should 
be paid to Mrs A.
For these purposes the date of calculation is the date selected by Broadleaf within 60 days 
from the later of:-
the date Mrs A accepts my final decision and 
the date Mr A provides three independent valuations for her normal and main  
residence to Broadleaf.
Past loss
Ref: DRN754811541.Using the full valuation of the WRAP at the date of calculation  as set out above  and 
which for the avoidance of doubt in this situation is the entire  value of the WRAP at 
that date (and not just that part which might be subject to IHT.)
2.Ascertain what the notional value of the dependants flexi-access drawdown 
arrangement would have been  as at the date of calculation had the amount invested  
in the WRAP been  invested from the date of transfer  into the WRAP as follows.  I 
have no way of determining definitively into what holdings, and in what  proportions, 
the monies in question would have been  invested  had suitable  advice been given 
and had monies gone into a dependents flexi-access drawdown arrangement.  As 
such, I am satisfied  that the FTSE  UK Private Investors Income  Total Return Index  
(formerly the FTSE WMA  Stock  Market Income Total Return Index) should be used 
as a proxy to determine the return the monies  in question would have enjoyed to 
date. 
I consider that to be a reasonable proxy for the type of return  that could have been  
achieved over the period in question and within  a degree of risk which  was 
appropriate for Mrs As circumstances.  For the purposes of this calculation  it should 
be assumed that the same sum that was invested in the WRAP would have been 
invested in the dependants  flexi-access  drawdown  arrangement and on the same  
date. There should  also be an allowance for deductions for any net income payments 
Mrs A has received from her WRAP to date (it should be assumed such payments 
would have been made and on the same  dates from the dependents flexi-access 
drawdown arrangement). 
If it assists  Broadleaf in making the calculation simpler, then it would not be 
unreasonable for Broadleaf to simply total all the net income  payments  received by 
Mrs A to date and to then deduct that figure  at the end of the notional calculation  
instead of deducting the individual  payments periodically.
3.Deduct the sum arrived  at in 1, from the sum arrived at in 2. If the sum of the amount 
under 2 is greater  than the amount in 1 then this resulting sum represents  the past 
loss. This sum should be paid directly to Mrs A. If this calculation  shows  the amount 
under 1 is greater  than the amount under 2 then this is a past gain (because the 
value of the WRAP at the date of calculation is greater  than the amount calculated  
under 2 above) this may be offset  against  any future loss identified  below.
Future Loss
1.External taxation   ask the investment WRAP provider  to calculate the tax that would 
be payable by Mrs A/the investment WRAP (i.e. deductible prior to payment to Mrs 
A) were she to draw 4% of the WRAP as income/using the same interest/dividend 
split as in 2017/18  tax year and assuming she receives the same interest/dividend 
tax allowances  applicable for that year. Multiply the resulting tax sum by XY years.
2.Pay the sum arrived at in 1 above  directly  to Mrs A. This is intended to roughly 
represent the tax payable  by Mrs A over the rest of her lifetime by way of taking 
income from the WRAP which would not have been payable had income been taken 
from a dependents  flexi-access drawdown  arrangement.
3.Internal taxation  - Ask the investment WRAP provider to determine  the value of any 
tax deducted from investments  in the WRAP within the 12 months prior 6 April 2019  
Ref: DRN75481155and ignoring those investments realised to pay income, (which should be disregarded  
from this portion of the calculation), which would  not have been deducted had the 
same investments been held in one of the investment WRAP providers pension 
arrangements over the same time period  (for ease  the provider should be asked  to 
assume the monies would  have been invested  in a SIPP over the same period). It 
should be explained to the provider that the reason for the request is further to an 
assessment issued by this Service and the purpose of the request is to determine in 
monetary terms the tax inefficiency, if any, over the 12 months  prior 6 April 2019 of 
monies being invested in the WRAP rather than in a SIPP with the provider (and 
even if identical investments cannot  be held in the SIPP  for the purposes of this 
request the provider  should assume  they can be).
4.Multiply the monetary tax value  provided  in 3 by XY years.
5.Pay the sum arrived at in 4 directly to Mrs A. This is intended to roughly represent the 
tax deducted on investments  within  the WRAP not taken as income by Mrs A, over 
the rest of her lifetime, which would not have been deducted had the same monies 
been in a dependents flexi-access drawdown  arrangement.
my provisional decision
I propose to uphold this complaint.
I propose to direct that Broadleaf Financial Services Ltd should pay to Mrs A:-
1.£500 for distress  and inconvenience.
2.£2500  for the cost of valuations of the estate for inheritance tax purposes.
3.Such reasonable costs as Mrs A incurs in obtaining three  independent valuations  of 
her main residence subject to the provision of written evidence  of those costs by Mrs 
A.
I further propose to direct  that subject to Mrs A providing valuations of her main residence as 
set out above  and such updated valuations of her other assets as Broadleaf  Financial 
Services Ltd may reasonably require Broadleaf Financial Services  Ltd should:-
1.within 60 days of the later of :-
a.us notifying  Broadleaf Financial Services Ltd that Mrs A has accepted my 
decision and
b.Mrs A providing three valuations of the main residence as above,
calculate and should pay to Mrs A the amounts calculated as set out above in relations  to 
each of the following:-
IHT on Mrs As death
Past loss 
Future Loss  external  taxation
Ref: DRN75481156Future Loss  internal  taxation
Broadleaf Financial Services Ltd must also provide  copies of their calculations, and 
supporting documentation, in respect of the above  to both Mrs A and this Service.
Redress in this case is, unfortunately, by necessity  very complicated.  As such,  it is only fair 
and reasonable that Mrs A has the opportunity to review the calculations once they have 
been performed  to ensure  she is happy  the requisite steps have been followed.
All amounts directed  to be payable by Broadleaf Financial Services  Ltd must be calculated  
and paid within 60 days of the later of :-
a.us notifying  Broadleaf Financial Services Ltd that Mrs A has accepted my 
decision and
b.Mrs A providing three valuations of the main residence as above.
If it pays later than this it must also pay further interest on the compensation from the date of 
the final decision until the date of payment at the rate of 8% simple  per year.
If it considers it is legally required to deduct  income  tax from the interest, it must send a tax 
deduction certificate with the payment so that Mrs A can reclaim the tax if she is able to.
Mrs A should refer back to Broadleaf  Financial Services Ltd if she is unsure of the approach  
it has taken and both parties should contact HM Revenue & Customs  if they want to know  
more about the tax treatment of this portion of the compensation
Fair compensation should be calculated  as set out above. Broadleaf Financial Services Ltd 
should pay Mrs A the amount produced by that calculation   up to a maximum of £150,000  
(including distress and/or  inconvenience but excluding costs) plus any interest set out above.
Recommendation: If the amount produced by the calculation of fair compensation exceeds 
£150,000, I recommend that Broadleaf Financial  Services Ltd pays  Mrs A the balance plus 
interest set out above. This recommendation is not part of my determination  or award.  It 
would not bind Broadleaf Financial Services Ltd. 
Mrs A said she had no further comments.  She advised that she had now paid adviser fees of 
£3240 and provided three valuations for her property which gave  an average price  of 
£421,666.00. Broadleaf  was notified of these  and provided with copies of the valuations but 
made no further comments.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I have not changed my 
mind.
As we now have three valuations of Mrs A main residence I can amend my final direction to 
reflect the fact that information is now available.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  and direct that Broadleaf  Financial Services Ltd should  pay to Mrs A:-
Ref: DRN754811571.£500 for distress  and inconvenience.
2.£3240  for the cost of valuations of the estate for inheritance tax purposes.
3.Such reasonable costs as Mrs A incurred in obtaining three independent valuations 
of her main residence subject to the provision of written evidence of those  costs  by 
Mrs A.
I further direct that Mrs A should provide such updated valuations  of her other assets as 
Broadleaf Financial Services Ltd may reasonably  require (for these purpose I regard 
information of the type already provided  as reasonable) and Broadleaf  Financial Services  Ltd 
shall within  60 days of us notifying Broadleaf Financial Services Ltd that Mrs A has accepted  
my decision  calculate  and pay to Mrs A the amounts calculated  as set out below in relations 
to each of:-
IHT on Mrs As death
Past loss 
Future Loss  external  taxation
Future Loss  internal  taxation
For the purposes of these  calculations the value of Mrs As only and main residence shall be 
assumed to be £421,666. 
The date of calculation  for these purposes shall mean the date set by Broadleaf Financial 
Services Ltd which is within the period of 60 days from us notifying Broadleaf  Financial  
Services Ltd that Mrs A has accepted my decision.
