The complaint
Mr C has complained that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) acted unfairly by 
continuing to apply charges to his account when he was getting further into overdraft without 
his knowledge and struggling financially.
  
What happened
Mr C complained to NatWest when he discovered how far in overdraft he was and the 
charges that had been applied to his account. He said had he known about the level of debt 
he was in he couldve managed the account better and the extra cost of the charges have 
caused him financial difficulty. NatWest didnt uphold the complaint  it says all charges were 
applied in-line with the terms and conditions of the account. And as Mr C was dis-satisfied 
he referred the complaint to our service.
Mr Cs complaint was considered by one of our adjudicators. They thought that NatWest 
ought to have realised that Mr C was experiencing financial difficulty by 17 January 2015 
and so shouldnt have added any more interest, fees and charges from this point onwards. 
NatWest said that the account received a regular income and had very few unarranged and 
unpaid charges. It didnt think that the statements showed Mr C as being in financial 
difficulty. So the case was passed to an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
NatWest will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at whether a bank treated a customer fairly and reasonably when applying 
overdraft charges. So I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision.
Having carefully considered everything provided, Im intending to find that NatWest acted 
unfairly when it continued charging overdraft interest and associated fees on Mr Cs 
overdraft from 17 January 2015. By this point, it ought to have been clear that Mr C was in 
no position to sustainably repay what he owed within a reasonable period of time. 
By this point, Mr C was hardcore borrowing. In other, words he hadnt seen or maintained a 
credit balance for an extended period of time. Indeed, every month Mr C went further and 
further into his overdraft and this pattern continued for a number of years. NatWests own 
literature suggests that overdrafts are for unforeseen emergency borrowing not prolonged 
day-to-day expenditure. So I think that Mr Cs overdraft usage should have prompted 
NatWest to have realised that Mr C wasnt using his overdraft as intended and shouldnt 
have continued offering it on the same terms. As NatWest didnt react to Mr Cs overdraft 
usage and instead continued charging in the same way, I think it failed to act fairly and 
reasonably. 
Mr C ended up paying additional interest, fees and charges on his overdraft and this ended 
up exacerbating difficulties he already had in trying to clear it. So I think that NatWest didnt 
treat Mr C fairly and he lost out because of what NatWest did wrong. And this means that it 
should put things right.
Putting things right
Having thought about everything, I think that it would be fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances of Mr Cs complaint for NatWest to put things right by:
Reworking Mr Cs current overdraft balance so that all interest, fees and charges 
applied to it from 17 January 2015 are removed.
AND
If an outstanding balance remains on the overdraft once these adjustments have 
been made NatWest should contact Mr C to arrange a suitable repayment plan, 
Mr C is encouraged to get in contact with and cooperate with NatWest to reach a 
suitable agreement. If it considers it appropriate to record negative information on 
Mr Cs credit file, NatWest should reflect what would have been recorded had it 
started the process of taking corrective action on the overdraft from 17 January 
2015. NatWest can also reduce overdraft limit by the amount of refund if it 
considers it appropriate to do so, as long as doing so wouldnt leave Mr C over 
his limit.
OR
If the effect of removing all interest, fees and charges results in there no longer 
being an outstanding balance, then any extra should be treated as overpayments 
and returned to Mr C along with 8% simple interest on the overpayments from 
the date they were made (if they were) until the date of settlement. If no 
outstanding balance remains after all adjustments have been made, then 
NatWest should remove any adverse information from Mr Cs credit file. NatWest 
can also reduce Mr Cs overdraft limit by the amount of refund if it considers it 
appropriate to do so.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires NatWest to take off tax from this interest. NatWest must 
give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if they ask for one.My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Cs complaint. National Westminster Bank 
Plc should put things right in the way Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 February 2022.
