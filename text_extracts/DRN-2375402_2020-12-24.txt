The complaint
Mr B has complained that CarCashPoint Limited lent to him irresponsibly.
What happened
Mr B was given a logbook loan of £2,410 by CarCashPoint in January 2013. The loan was 
secured against a vehicle that he owned.
The loan was due to be repaid in 78 weekly instalments of around £86.The total amount to 
be repaid including interest was just over £6,748.
CarCashPoint thought that too much time had passed for the complaint to be considered. 
But following an ombudsmans decision that this Service could look into the matter, an 
adjudicator looked into the complaint. He initially thought there wasnt enough information 
available for him to say that CarCashPoint had done anything wrong. But Mr B provided 
further information which changed the adjudicators view of the matter. He thought 
CarCashPoint shouldnt have provided Mr B with the loan and he asked the lender to put 
things right. CarCashPoint doesnt appear to have responded to either of the adjudicators 
two assessments. 
So as the matter has not been settled, it has been passed to me to make a final decision 
about the complaint.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our approach to considering unaffordable and irresponsible lending complaints 
on our website - including the key relevant rules, guidance, good industry practice and law. 
And Ive considered this approach when deciding Mr Bs complaint.
I think there are overarching questions I need to consider in order to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this particular complaint:
Did CarCashPoint complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr B would be able to repay his loan in a sustainable way? If so, did it make a fair 
lending decision? If not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have 
shown at the time?
Did CarCashPoint act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
CarCashPoint needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend to Mr B 
irresponsibly. This means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to satisfy itself 
that he could repay the loan in a sustainable way. The lender was required to carry out a 
borrower focussed assessment - sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or 
affordability check. 
The checks had to be borrower focussed  so CarCashPoint had to think about whether 
repaying the loan sustainably would cause any difficulties or adverse consequences for Mr 
B. In other words, it wasnt enough for CarCashPoint to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of loan repayments on Mr B.
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of each loan application. 
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer, such as their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications 
of vulnerability or financial difficulty and the amount / type / cost of credit they are seeking. 
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough: 
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); and 
the longer the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit is 
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make payments for an extended 
period).
Ive carefully considered all the evidence, arguments and information Ive seen about this 
matter and what it means for Mr B. 
I have seen only limited information about the checks that CarCashPoint carried out at the 
time. CarCashPoint says it asked Mr B for information about his income and expenditure but 
it wasnt its usual practice to carry out formal credit checks at the time. CarCashPoint says it 
carried out an affordability assessment designed to be proportionate to the size and term of 
the loan. It thinks that the loan was affordable for Mr B. 
I would have expected the lender to want to gather enough information for it to have a 
thorough understanding of Mr Bs financial position, to ensure that he could repay his loan 
sustainably. Given that the lender didnt carry out a formal credit check, I think it would have 
been proportionate for CarCashPoint to have taken steps to independently verify Mr Bs 
circumstances, and to check his regular monthly expenditure - for example by requesting 
bank statements - rather than rely largely on information that Mr B was providing about his 
expenditure.
And from what Ive seen, CarCashPoint did review Mr Bs bank statements. I havent seen 
what bank statements were reviewed at the time as these are no longer held by the lender. 
This is understandable given the amount of time that has passed. But overall, I dont have 
enough information about the checks that CarCashPoint carried out for me to say I think 
these checks reasonable and proportionate. 
But in any event, I dont think CarCashPoint made a fair lending decision at the time, and I 
will explain why.
As I have explained, I havent seen what bank statements CarCashPoint reviewed at the 
time. But Mr B has provided a number of bank statements for the months leading up to his loan application. Different checks show different things but I think its likely that the 
information gathered by CarCashPoint during its checks, including the bank statements it 
reviewed, would have been broadly similar to the information that Mr B has been able to 
provide to us.
CarCashPoint says there was no evidence of any financial hardship or adverse credit and it 
assessed that Mr B had sufficient disposable income to meet his loan repayments. But I 
think CarCashPoint focussed its calculation of whether the loan was affordable for Mr B on a 
pounds and pence basis. And as Ive already explained, the lender was required to establish 
whether the borrower could sustainably meet his loan repayments  not just whether the 
loan payments were technically affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesn't automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And 
it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
CarCashPoint was providing Mr B with an expensive loan, repayable over an extended 
period and the rules and guidance suggest that the risk of any credit not being sustainable 
directly relates to the amount of credit granted and the total charge for credit - relative to the 
customers financial situation.
I think that when CarCashPoint reviewed Mr Bs bank statements its likely it would have 
discovered more about Mr Bs financial position. I think CarCashPoint ought reasonably to 
have become aware that Mr Bs finances were showing a number of signs of financial 
distress: he was fairly consistently overdrawn and being charged for unplanned and planned 
overdrafts and other fees; his expenditure regularly seemed to exceed his income and there 
are betting transactions on his bank statements that I think ought to have raised some 
concerns for the lender.  
I havent seen anything which makes me think CarCashPoint discussed any of these issues 
with Mr B. As Ive already explained, CarCashPoint was required to establish whether Mr B 
could sustainably make his loan repayments. On balance, I think CarCashPoint ought 
reasonably to have recognised from the information it gathered that Mr B was having some 
difficulty managing his financial situation. I think it ought reasonably to have realised that Mr 
B was borrowing to keep up with his ongoing financial commitments and potentially to 
support regular betting,  and that it was most likely he would need to borrow elsewhere to 
repay his loan. I think CarCashPoint ought to have realised that it was unlikely that Mr B 
would have been able to sustainably repay his loan over the extended loan term. So 
CarCashPoint ought reasonably to have concluded that it was not appropriate to provide him 
with the loan.
During the course of our investigation, Mr B has also provided us with evidence that he had 
an outstanding County Court Judgment when he took the loan from CarCashPoint. He says 
he told the lender about this at the time, but I havent seen enough information about what 
happened at the time for me to say that I think CarCashPoint was aware of the CCJ when it 
agreed to provide the loan to Mr B. I havent seen anything which makes me think that 
CarCashPoint treated Mr B unfairly in any other way. But I dont think it should have 
provided the loan to him. So CarCashPoint needs to put things right.
Putting things rightI think its fair and reasonable for Mr B to have repaid the principal amount that he borrowed, 
because he had the benefit of that lending. But he has paid interest and charges on a loan 
that shouldnt have been provided to him. I think Mr B has lost out and CarCashPoint should 
put things right for him.
I havent seen anything to suggest that Mr B didnt repay the loan or that his car was 
repossessed by the lender. However, if CarCashPoint sold any outstanding debt payable in 
respect of Mr Bs loan, it should buy it back from the third party, if its able to do so, and then 
take the following steps. If CarCashPoint isnt able to buy any outstanding debt back then it 
should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
CarCashPoint should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges from the loan and treat all the payments 
Mr B made as payments towards the capital. 
If reworking Mr Bs loan account results in his having effectively made payments 
above the original capital borrowed, then CarCashPoint should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled*. 
If reworking the account leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, then 
CarCashPoint should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr B, 
bearing in mind its obligation to treat him positively and sympathetically in these 
discussions.
CarCashPoint might have already returned the logbook to Mr B, but if it has not 
done this, it should cancel the bill of sale and return the V5 document to him once 
any outstanding capital has been repaid.
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Bs credit file in relation to the 
loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to deduct tax from this interest. 
CarCashPoint should give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks 
for one.
  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Bs complaint and direct CarCashPoint Limited to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 January 2021.
