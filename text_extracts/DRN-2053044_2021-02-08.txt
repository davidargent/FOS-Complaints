The complaint
Ms N complains that Barclays Bank UK plc, trading as Barclaycard, wont refund to her the 
money that she paid for some granite worktops. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Ms N used her Barclaycard credit card to make two payments for granite worktops to 
be supplied and fitted  the first in September 2019 for £250 and the second in 
November 2019 for £1,650;
she says that a crack in the granite was noticed a few days after the worktops had 
been fitted so she complained to the supplier  it initially offered to repair the crack as 
a gesture of goodwill but wouldnt replace the worktops as it had photos of the fitted 
worktops without a crack and Ms N had signed a completion statement  but its offer 
to repair the crack has been withdrawn;
Ms N made a claim to Barclaycard under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 
and the chargeback rules for the money that shed paid for the worktops - and she 
then complained to this service;
our investigator thought that Barclaycard had acted fairly and reasonably in rejecting 
the section 75 claim as there wasnt enough evidence to show that there was a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and he didnt think that a 
chargeback wouldve had a reasonable chance of success so Barclaycard had acted 
reasonably in not pursuing it;
Ms N says that its a hair-line crack which isnt visible in the suppliers photos and 
that her kitchen fitter hadnt done any work on that area before he noticed the crack; 
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made but, if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
Barclaycard investigated Ms Ns claim and the supplier provided photos showing the 
fitted worktops without a crack and the completion statement signed by Ms N so it 
concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of a successful chargeback claim 
in these circumstances  and I consider that it was fair and reasonable for it to reach 
that conclusion and I dont consider that it acted incorrectly by not making a 
chargeback claim;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Ms Ns complaint about Barclaycard, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that 
Barclaycards response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but 
Im not determining the outcome of Ms Ns claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
the supplier has provided photos showing the fitted worktops without a crack and 
Ms N has provided a photo showing the crack  the crack in the photo provided by 
Ms N is clearly visible and I consider it to be more than a hair-line crack;
Ms N signed a completion statement which said: I confirm that I have checked all the 
above points and am happy that all works have been completed; and one of those 
points was that:  client has checked all the tops for cracks, chips and scratches;
if the crack in the granite had been there when Ms N was asked to sign the 
completion statement I consider that she would have noticed the crack and would 
have refused to sign the completion statement;
I consider it to be more likely than not in these circumstances that the crack has been 
caused after the worktops were fitted and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier; and
I sympathise with Ms N for the damage thats been caused to her granite worktops 
but I consider that Barclaycards response to her claim was fair and reasonable in 
these circumstances and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require 
it refund to her any of the money that she paid for the worktops, to pay her any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ns complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms N to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 March 2021.
