K821x#15complaint
Mr G says Elevate Credit International Limited  trading as Sunny  irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about eight instalment loans Sunny  provided  to Mr G between July 2017  
and May 2018.  Mr Gs borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Highest Combined Repayment
1 12/07/2017 31/08/2017 6 £200.00 £61.84
2 13/09/2017 08/02/2018 6 £300.00 £91.28
3 20/02/2018 17/04/2018 6 £150.00 £42.78
4 08/03/2018 17/04/2018 6 £350.00 £153.42
5 19/03/2018 17/04/2018 6 £100.00 £182.65
6 06/04/2018 17/04/2018 6 £100.00 £214.66
7 16/05/2018 31/05/2018 6 £300.00 £90.02
8 26/05/2018 29/06/2018 6 £100.00 £33.35
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Gs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans decisions, so 
the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider a number of different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN98178512the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC)  defines  sustainable as 
being without  undue  difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on 
time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to 
meet the repayments. And it follows  that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly  and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Mr Gs complaint  about loans 1 to 5. Mr G didnt respond to the 
adjudicators opinion. As there is no dispute  with the adjudicators  findings  about these 
loans, I wont be making  any further findings on these  loans.  
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr G, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6 I say 
this because - although  Sunny did do several checks  on Mr G - at this point it ought to have 
realised Mr G was not managing to repay  his loans sustainably. Mr G had been  indebted  to 
Sunny for around 9 months. So, Sunny ought  to have realised it was more likely than not   
Mr G was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Gs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
In addition, Mr G wasnt making  any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 8 was 
taken out 10 months  after Mr Gs first loan.  Mr G had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.
I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 5 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period.
Ref: DRN98178513the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Gs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans. 
So, Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 6 to 8 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 6 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  6 to 8 should be removed from Mr 
Gs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr G a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 February  2020.
