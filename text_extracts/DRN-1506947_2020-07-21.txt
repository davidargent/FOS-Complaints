The complaint
Miss K complains about problems she experienced whilst trying to use Nationwide Building 
Societys mobile banking application. 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on setting out the reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Nationwide upheld Miss Ks complaints about its mobile banking application and
confirmed that, following a systems upgrade, it wasnt working at all times.
Nationwide also accepts it failed to update Miss Ks telephone number on its systems
after Miss K complained.
Whilst there were technical issues with Nationwides systems, they were resolved
and Miss K has confirmed the mobile banking application works for her.
Ive considered the length of time Miss K was without the mobile banking application,
the impact of being without access to banking information, the fact Nationwide didnt
initially update her telephone number and the delays in responding to her queries
when reaching my decision. Having done so, Im satisfied the total compensation of
Â£60 Nationwide has paid is fair in all the circumstances.
As the technical issues have been resolved and I'm satisfied Nationwide has dealt
with this complaint fairly I'm not telling it to take any further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
DRN-1506947Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss K to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 August 2020.
