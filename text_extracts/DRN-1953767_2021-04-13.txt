The complaint
Mr and Mrs C complain that they were mis-sold an HSBC Premier Account (HPA) in April 
2019 by HSBC Bank UK Plc (HSBC).
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr and Mrs C say that HSBC told them that their daughter was covered by the HPAs travel 
insurance. HSBC says it provided all the information about the HPA to Mr and Mrs C which 
included that their daughter was not covered by the HPAs travel insurance when travelling 
only with friends.
The sale took place in a branch, so I have no way of knowing what was said. And the two 
parties say opposite things about the discussion.
In such a situation I can only look at what records there are available. HSBC says that it 
followed its usual procedure and has provided evidence that it gave Mr and Mrs C a 
welcome pack in the meeting. Mr and Mrs C have not disputed this. Ive looked at the 
information they received, and it does include that any child of the HPA holder would not be 
covered if only travelling with friends. In this situation, in my view, Im not able to say its 
more likely than not Mr and Mrs C didnt receive the correct information, so I cant uphold 
their complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr and Mrs Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision before 11 May 2021.
