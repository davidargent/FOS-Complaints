The complaint
Mr Cs complaint about Brent Shrine Credit Union Limited, trading as My Community Bank 
(MCB), relates to a payment plan he entered into and the level of the settlement figure he 
was given.
What happened
In April 2018 Mr C applied for and obtained from MCB a £5,000 loan over 60 months at an 
interest rate of 22.7% with a total charge for interest calculated to be £3,409.56. 
Repayments were fixed at £140.09 per month with the first repayment scheduled for 15 May 
2018 and the loan termination date set as 13 April 2023. Mr C made additional repayments 
beyond his contractual payments. 
On 9 September 2019 Mr C asked for a payment plan and an interest freeze as he had 
encountered financial difficulties. MCB agreed to a payment plan reducing the monthly sum 
from £140.09 to £25.82 for 50 months but it did not agree to an interest freeze.
Mr C then made further payments of £500 in May and June 2020, and £100 in July 2020 
whilst continuing to pay the monthly agreed sum of £25.82.
Prior to that, on 29 August 2019 Mr C asked for a settlement figure and says he was told it 
was £1,364.82. He asked for a further settlement figure in June 2020 which he says he was 
told was the same. MCB dont agree and have said Mr C was told it was £370.06.
Mr C says that subsequently he found out that the payments he was making on his payment 
plan were for interest only which is why he feels the settlement figure didnt change between 
September 2019 and June 2020. He feels he was misled by MCB.
Mr C was unhappy with MCBs final response and so approached this service to see if we 
could assist in resolving the dispute. Our investigator thought that MCB hadnt done anything 
wrong. Mr C didnt agree and asked for the complaint to be passed to an Ombudsman for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
My summary of what happened is brief and I know the parties went into a lot more detail. Im 
going to focus however on what I think the key issues are as our rules allow me to do this 
and it reflects the nature of our service as an informal alternative to the courts. So, if theres 
something Ive not mentioned, it isnt because Ive ignored it, its because Im satisfied that I 
dont need to comment on every individual argument to be able to reach what I think is the 
right outcome.
Ive taken account of both sides views when considering whether MCB acted fairly and 
reasonably. Ive looked at the issues raised and considered all the available evidence. 
Where evidence is not complete, I think about what is more likely to have happened in the 
light of the evidence which is available. 
Mr C does not take issue with the initial loan amount, interest rate, loan duration or 
repayment rate. Mr C made his contractual payments up to 27 August 2019 and he has also 
made additional advance payments which arent disputed. 
MCB have provided evidence in the form of a statement of account, which Ive checked, and 
this shows the initial loan advance of £5,000 and then Mr Cs contractual repayments. It also 
shows how the interest is applied monthly and whilst this varies slightly each month because 
of the differing number of days in each month, it is also reducing the balance over the period 
as Mr C made larger lump sum payments. It is clear to me from this statement that each 
repayment Mr C made went towards interest and principal reduction. Further the actual loan 
agreement shows that payments will be applied to both interest and the principal.
The statement also shows that from 25 September 2019 Mr C began to make the reduced 
repayments of £25.82. This follows his request on 9 September for an arrangement for 3-4 
months to freeze the interest and charges by reducing his monthly repayment plan from 
£140 to £20. MCB agrees that it declined Mr Cs request but states it did offer the payment 
plan of £25.82 over 50 months to reduce the financial burden on Mr C. 
MCB has confirmed that the period of 50 months was a default option in the direct debit 
system they were using at that time and it was not intended that the plan would run for that 
length of time. What was intended was that Mr C would be given an interest only schedule 
for 3-4 months in response to his request for the interest freeze.
I think this shows that although Mr C wasnt given what he asked for, MCB were still 
nevertheless responding to him and his altered circumstances positively and with empathy. 
MCB have explained that this approach allowed Mr C to continue making payments towards 
his loan without having an adverse report made to his credit file.
I know Mr C states that MCB told him over the telephone that by paying £25.82 over 50 
months he would pay off the loan, but there is no evidence that this was agreed and indeed 
it could never have discharged the sum that was outstanding over that period. So, Im not 
satisfied that MCB told Mr C that the payment plan he was put on in September 2019 would 
have cleared his balance over 50 months.
Mr C has also said that when he asked for a settlement figure in August 2019 and then again 
in June 2020 the figure he was given didnt change. Mr C makes the point that between 
September 2019 and May 2020 his loan balance only reduced by 29p, but I think this 
misrepresents the true picture. When taking account the repayment Mr C also made in April 
2020 I can see that the balance dropped by £26.11 over that period.
MCB have provided evidence in the form of emails to Mr C which shows that on 29 August 
2019 he was told by email that the figure to settle his account was £1,365.54, and then in 
September 2020, (again by email), that it was £370.06. I cannot agree therefore that Mr C 
was advised of different settlement figures.
Looking further at the evidence, I can see that from May 2020 Mr C began making 
overpayments on his loan which gradually took the balance down to zero. The four 
overpayments he made between May 2020 and December 2020 of £1,200 has to be set 
against the balance of £1,364.82 he had in September 2019. These overpayments Mr C 
made were of course in addition to the regular £25.82 scheduled monthly payments he was 
also making, but because he was making the overpayments, the monthly amount of interest 
charged to his account reduced. That meant that the regular £25.82 payments which had originally been set up to just meet the interest, also started to reduce the principal sum as 
well, since the interest per month was less than the £25.82.
So, although Mr C will probably be disappointed with my decision, for the reasons I have set 
out above, I cant say MCB has acted unfairly or unreasonably here and Im not upholding 
this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 August 2021.
