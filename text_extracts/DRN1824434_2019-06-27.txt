Mr A says that at the time of the loans  he was caught in a cycle of debt and was borrowing 
to meet  his repayments on existing debts. He says that further affordability checks  should 
have taken place  before the loans were  provided and that the loans affected his credit file.
QuickQuid says that the first group of loans, (loan  one to 11) fluctuated in amount with the 
highest amount  borrowed  being  £350. It says only one late fee was incurred and this was 
cured on the same day. It says Mr A didnt express any financial hardship  and that the 
checks it carried out didnt  raise concerns.
Ref: DRN18244342Before loan 12 was provided, QuickQuid says it asked for information about  Mr As 
expenses as well as his income. It says Mr A had a disposable income  of £875 ad that the 
loan was proportionate and affordable.
In regard to loans 13 to 23, QuickQuid says it carried out proportionate affordability checks 
before these were  provided including validating Mr As income and expenses.  
QuickQuid says that Mr A repaid a number of his loans early and that there  were  significant 
breaks in his borrowing history. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think there  was enough evidence to say that loans one to five 
(including the first two top ups) shouldnt have been provided. However she thought that the 
third top up on loan five and all subsequent loans shouldnt have been provided.
QuickQuid didnt accept  our adjudicators view. As a resolution hasnt been agreed, this 
complaint has been passed to me, an ombudsman, to make a decision.
my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr A could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks  could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumer's  income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr A could  sustainably repay  his loans  - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
Ref: DRN18244343the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further.
The early  loans in this case were provided  before CONC.  At that time the relevant  guidance  
was provided by the Office of Fair trading (OFT) and this also set out the need to make  a 
reasonable assessment of whether a borrower  can afford to meet repayments in a 
sustainable manner.  This refers to issues such as being able to the make  the repayments  
without undue difficulties  throughout the life of the agreement and without having to realise 
security or assets. It then further sets out that without  undue difficulty  means without having 
to borrow further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr As complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt  think there  was enough evidence to say that loans one to five 
(including the first two top ups to this loan) shouldnt have been provided.  Based on the 
evidence I have seen  I agree  with this.
Following the final top up of loan five, the repayment increased to £453. This was a 
substantial amount compared to Mr As declared income of £1,100. It was also the third top 
up of the loan in a few days and followed previous loans being taken out in close 
succession. Based on this I think QuickQuid should have been concerned that Mr A wouldnt 
be able to meet his existing commitments without having to borrow  again. 
Mr A repaid  loan five and took out a new loan four days later which  he then topped  up on a 
number of occasions. Again, I think the information provided should  have  caused  concern 
that this loan wasnt sustainably affordable and that Mr A was borrowing again  to meet his 
commitments.
By loan seven I think that Mr As overall  pattern  of borrowing suggested he had become 
persistently reliant  on short-term loans. This was his seventh  loan in less than eight months 
and although the amounts borrowed fluctuated I think  the pattern of borrowing showed the 
loans from here were unsustainable.
There was a gap in the lending to Mr A between the repayment of loan 11 and loan 12 being  
provided. This gap was less than nine months  and given Mr As previous pattern of 
borrowing and the time over which he had been  borrowing  form QuickQuid I dont think that 
it would  have been reasonable for QuickQuid to conclude this gap was any indication that 
Mr As finances had moved  on from whatever  situation  had required his previous loans. 
Likewise I dont think the gap of around  seven months between  loans 20 and 21 should  have  
meant QuickQuid had good  reason  to think Mr As situation had changed.  Because  of this I 
have treated all the loans  as part of the same  lending  chain  and think that the loans from 12 
September 2013 shouldnt have been  provided.
Overall, I think that Mr A lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from 
the third top up of loan five onwards. These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr A's 
indebtedness by allowing  him to take expensive credit intended for short  term use over an 
Ref: DRN18244344extended period  of time. The sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative  
implications on Mr A's ability to access mainstream  credit and so kept him in the market for 
these high-cost loans
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to the third top up of loan five and 
all subsequent loans.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid)  should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mr A paid on third top-up on loan five and all 
subsequent loans;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about the third top-up on loan five and loan six from 
Mr A's credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan seven means any information recorded about  
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  seven to 23 should be removed from 
Mr As credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr A a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 July 2019.
