K821x#15complaint
Mr H says FCL Consumer Finance Ltd  trading as SmartPig  irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 8 payday loans SmartPig provided to Mr H between December 2016 
and March 2018. Mr Hs borrowing  history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken
Date Repaid
Instalments Amount Repayment
1 05/12/2016 09/01/2017 1 £200.00 £256.00
2 30/01/2017 28/04/2017 1 £350.00 £525.00
3 04/05/2017 01/06/2017 1 £350.00 £428.40
4 04/06/2017 27/06/2017 1 £350.00 £413.20
5 28/06/2017 28/09/2017 1 £350.00 £525.00
6 25/10/2017 05/12/2017 1 £250.00 £334.00
7 06/12/2017 08/01/2018 1 £250.00 £316.00
8 10/03/2018 16/04/2018 1 £250.00 £324.00
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Hs complaint and thought  Mr Hs income wasnt  as high 
as SmartPig had said. This was because Mr H was a student at the time the loans were 
taken out and was using  his student  loans and income from his family to make the 
repayments. They also thought the loans from loan 5 onwards shouldnt have been  given 
because Mr Hs behaviour  was indicating he wasnt managing his money. SmartPig 
disagreed and said Mr Hs pattern of borrowing and repaying his loans early showed he had 
income to do so. SmartPig said this was shown as loan 5 was repaid during school holiday 
time. 
As the matter couldnt be resolved informally, the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
SmartPig needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might  be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that SmartPig  should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN67971112the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that SmartPig was required to establish  
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should  be able to make repayments  on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet  the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint. Having done  so, Im partially upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think SmartPig needed  to do more when it approved  loans 1 to 4. Mr H 
didnt respond  to the view. As there is no dispute with the adjudicators opinion about  these 
loans, I wont be making  any findings  on them.
SmartPig says the fact Mr H repaid loan 5 early and during a school holiday period shows  he 
had another form of income he was using  to repay  the borrowing. I dont necessarily agree 
with SmartPigs conclusion that by repaying  a loan early this means  he was managing his 
money. Its equally  possible that Mr H was juggling his finances  by borrowing to pay off his 
short-term loans with SmartPig or other short-term loan providers.  
As this was Mr Hs fifth loan in six months, I think SmartPig should have been looking to 
build a clearer picture than this about Mr Hs finances before lending him this loan. Mr H had 
been in debt with SmartPig almost  continually since loan 1. In almost  every case, when Mr H 
repaid a loan he needed  to borrow again with a matter of days. Loan 5 was for a larger  
amount than hed originally borrowed. It was likely this behaviour  of indebtedness was 
becoming increasingly more difficult to sustain. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of SmartPigs lending history  with Mr H, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which SmartPig should  reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so SmartPig  should  have realised  that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN67971113Given the circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
Mr Hs first loan was for £200 and loan 6 was for £250.  At this point SmartPig  ought 
to have known  that it was unlikely that Mr H was borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but more to meet an ongoing  need.  
Mr H wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed SmartPig. Loan 8 was 
taken out 15 months after Mr Hs first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr H had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect;  service  a debt to SmartPig over an extended  
period.
I think that Mr H lost out because SmartPig provided borrowing for loan 6 because:
This loan had the effect of unfairly  prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use over an extended period.
The length of time over which Mr H borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Hs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what SmartPig  needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 5 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Mr Hs credit file;
the number  of loans from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So, all entries about  loans  6 to 8 should  be removed from Mr Hs 
credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires SmartPig to take off tax from this interest. SmartPig must give   
Mr H a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Hs complaint. FCL Consumer 
Finance Ltd should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 11 March  2020.
