The complaint
Mr and Mrs H complain that GE Money Consumer Lending Limited has rejected the claims 
that theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a legal adviser.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in October 2022 in which I described what 
had happened as follows:
Mr and Mrs H entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with GE Money in March 
2008 to pay for a timeshare. The total amount of credit provided to them was £7,177 
and they agreed to make 180 monthly repayments of £111.23 to GE Money. The 
loan was repaid in January 2009.
Mr and Mrs H complained to GE Money in August 2020 that the timeshare company 
wasnt permitted or authorised to arrange the loan. GE Money said that the complaint 
was time barred under the Limitation Act 1980 but that the timeshare company was 
authorised to carry out regulated activities.
Mr and Mrs Hs representative then made a complaint to this service in March 2021 
about a number of issues, including that the timeshare company wasnt authorised to 
arrange the loan, the timeshare had been misrepresented to Mr and Mrs H, no credit 
checks were carried out and the interest rate was high. It also referred to an 
overseas court judgment which commented on the unlawful structure of a group of 
companies which included the timeshare company. This service forwarded the 
complaint to GE Money and it issued a detailed response to that complaint in which it 
said, amongst other things, that the claims were time-barred under the Limitation Act.
Our adjudicator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Hs complaint should be upheld. 
He considered their claims under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act but 
thought that they were raised too late and he couldnt conclude that section 32 of the 
Limitation Act extended the time limit. He also said that he hadnt seen any 
persuasive evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs H.
Mr and Mrs Hs representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It has responded in detail and says, in summary and 
amongst other things, that:
Mr and Mrs Hs claims are made under sections 75 and 140A of the 
Consumer Credit Act;
Mr and Mrs H failed to receive what they were promised by the timeshare 
company;
the ombudsman service isnt required to follow the relevant law, guidance 
and practice but to reach an evaluative assessment of the merits of GE 
Moneys decision;
the misrepresentations by the timeshare company were fraudulently made 
so the time limit for a claim is postponed under section 32 of the Limitation 
Act; and
the timeshare company wasnt authorised to arrange the loan.
It has also referred to a decision made by this service concerning the marketing 
practices of the timeshare company.
In my provisional decision I said: I agree with our adjudicator that Mr and Mrs Hs complaint 
shouldnt be upheld but for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and 
our rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  
that we cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six 
years after the event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the 
date on which the complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have 
become aware) that they had cause for complaint;
Mr and Mrs Hs complaint is that GE Money turned down the claims that theyd 
made to it and I accept that they referred their complaint to our service within six 
years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 
applies to their claims;
Mr and Mrs Hs claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not 
determining the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be 
able to do that - Im considering whether or not GE Moneys response to those 
claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods 
or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that 
section are met);
Mr and Mrs Hs claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented 
to them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to 
them - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, GE Money would be 
expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 
of the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action 
accrued (which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr and Mrs H could have made a claim to the timeshare company 
or GE Money about the misrepresentations that they say induced them into 
buying the timeshare in March 2008 as that was the latest time that any 
misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have been 
incurred as that was when they also entered into the loan agreement with GE 
Money;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so they would have had 
six years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the 
timeshare company or GE Money  but a claim wasnt made under section 75 
until March 2021, about thirteen years later which was outside of the time limits 
set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that their claim is now time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that Mr and Mrs H only became aware that they could make a misrepresentation claim to GE Money after they took advice 
from it  but when they had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist them 
for the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some 
sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at 
the time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that those 
sections are applicable to Mr and Mrs Hs claims;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that information was deliberately concealed 
from Mr and Mrs H and that the misrepresentations were fraudulently made to 
them so the time limits are postponed under section 32;
section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has 
been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until 
the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence 
have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate 
commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time 
amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
I dont consider that Mr and Mrs H have set out what the false statements of fact 
were that they say could amount to fraudulent misrepresentations and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a deliberate 
concealment of any relevant information in these circumstances - I consider that 
many of the things that Mr and Mrs H say werent right ought reasonably to have 
been known to them at the time of the sale - so I dont consider that section 32 is 
applicable in these circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between 
Mr and Mrs H and GE Money - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst 
other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a 
credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the 
debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim 
under section 140A is six years;
GE Money says that the loan agreement ended in January 2009 so Mr and Mrs H 
would have had six years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare 
company or GE Money  but a claim wasnt made until March 2021, more than 
twelve years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act 
so I consider that their claim under section 140A is now time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that the timeshare company acted as an 
unauthorised broker  but GE Money says that the timeshare company had the 
requisite authorities in place, initially under its Office of Fair Trading licence, 
which subsequently transferred to an interim permission from the Financial 
Conduct Authority and full permission was then granted for it to carry out 
regulated activities  and Im not persuaded that Mr and Mrs Hs representative 
has provided enough evidence to show that the timeshare company acted as an 
unauthorised broker in arranging the loan to Mr and Mrs H;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative has referred to an overseas court judgment which 
commented on the unlawful structure of a group of companies which included the 
timeshare company  but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that the structure of those companies was unlawful and I consider that any 
such claim would now also be time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that no credit checks were carried out by GE Money before the loan was made to Mr and Mrs H  but GE Money has provided 
evidence to show that it assessed the affordability of the loan for Mr and Mrs H 
and that it obtained information about their, employment, property ownership, 
income and expenditure which showed that they could afford a loan with monthly 
repayments of £111.23  but as the loan was made to them in March 2008 and 
ended in January 2009, I consider it to be more likely than not that any complaint 
about the affordability of the loans would now be time-barred;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that the high interest rate that Mr and Mrs H 
were expected to pay is also an indication of an unfair relationship  but Mr and 
Mrs H signed the loan agreement which clearly set out the annual rate of interest 
(and the APR), the amount of credit, the total charge for credit and the monthly 
repayment and immediately above their signatures it says This is a Credit 
Agreement regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Sign it only if you want to 
be legally bound by its terms  the agreement also set out their right to cancel 
the loan agreement but Ive seen no evidence to show that they tried to do so 
within the cancellation period;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative has referred to a decision made by this service 
concerning the marketing practices of the timeshare company but this service 
consider each complaint on its individual merits and Im not persuaded that 
theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs H were unduly pressured into 
buying the timeshare or entering into the loan agreement or that the timeshare 
company used unacceptable commercial practices against them  they didnt 
complain to GE Money about those issues until March 2021 (about thirteen years 
after they entered into the loan agreement) and I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have complained to GE Money about any such 
issues before then;
GE Money issued a substantive response to Mr and Mrs Hs claims in June 2021 
 I consider that it was fair and reasonable for it to apply the provisions of the 
Limitation Act in response to those claims and Im not persuaded that the 
outcome that its reached is unfair or unreasonable in these circumstances; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs H for the issues that theyve had with their 
timeshare and the difficulties that theyve experienced, but I find that it wouldnt 
be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require GE Money to 
refund to them any of the money that they paid under the loan agreement, to pay 
them any compensation or to take any other action in response to their 
complaint.
Subject to any further representations by any of Mr and Mrs H, their representative and GE 
Money, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend to uphold this complaint. Mr and 
Mrs Hs representative says that Mr and Mrs H dont accept my provisional decision. It has 
responded to it in detail and says, in summary, that: 
I havent specified what additional evidence would be required for a finding to be 
reached that there were fraudulent misrepresentations;
I havent clarified the basis on which Mr and Mrs H ought to have known the 
things that they say werent right at the time of the sale;
even if Mr and Mrs H did become aware of issues and inadequacies with the 
product promised, it doesnt necessarily follow that they would have appreciated 
that those issues constituted misrepresentation and civil fraud in law so its not 
accepted that they are statue barred in respect of a claim they may have against 
GE Money as they can rely on section 32;GE Money hasnt provided any tangible evidence to show that the timeshare 
company had the requisite authorises in place to arrange the loan; 
the identity of the credit intermediary thats been provided refers to a name which 
isnt an entity that could be an authorised person so its asked for clarification of 
the corporate body referred to;
the loan was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs H and the onus was on GE Money to 
ensure that it was affordable for them at the outset of the loan and remained so 
throughout its entire term; and 
it has referred to a decision issued by this service concerning the marketing 
practices of the timeshare company.
GE Money says that the loan was provided by GE Money Consumer Lending Limited 
which is no longer regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority as of December 2019 so Mr 
and Mrs H have lost their right to refer their complaint to this service and this service doesnt 
have jurisdiction to investigate the complaint. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive issued a separate decision in which Ive set out my findings on the jurisdiction of this 
service to consider Mr and Mrs Hs complaint about GE Moneys response to their section 75 
claim. In this decision Im only considering the other issues about which theyve complained.
Ive carefully considered Mr and Mrs Hs representatives response to my provisional 
decision. Having done so Im not persuaded that I should change my provisional findings on 
the issues that Im considering in this complaint. 
In my provisional decision I explained why I dont consider that section 32 is applicable in 
these circumstances. My role is to make a decision on the information provided and Im not 
required to specify what additional evidence would need to be provided for me to make a 
different finding. I also set out in my provisional decision my finding about the marketing 
practices that were used.
I can understand Mr and Mrs Hs frustration that GE Money hasnt specified which company 
within the timeshare companys group of companies was responsible for broking the loan to 
them, but they entered into the loan in March 2008 and it was repaid in January 2009. They 
then didnt contact GE Money about any issues with the authorisation of the credit 
intermediary until August 2020  more than eleven years after the loan was repaid. I dont 
consider that GE Money was required to still have full information about the loan more than 
eleven years after it was repaid. 
GE Money says that the credit intermediary had the required licence to arrange the loan and 
Ive seen that companies within the timeshare companys group of companies did have 
consumer credit licences in March 2008. Mr and Mrs H and their representative havent 
provided evidence to show that the credit intermediary for the loan didnt have a consumer 
credit licence and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to conclude that the credit intermediary for the loan to Mr and Mrs H 
didnt have the required licence.
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that GE Money was required to ensure that the loan was 
affordable for Mr and Mrs H at the outset of the loan and remained so throughout its entire 
term. That isnt correct. GE Money was required to assess the affordability of the loan at the time that it was made but it wouldnt be possible for it to ensure that the loan remained 
affordable throughout its term as that could be affected by many factors that werent known 
at the time of the loan and were outside of its control. 
GE Money has provided its underwriting sheet that was prepared for the loan to Mr and 
Mrs H and I consider it to be clear that it did assess the affordability of the loan for them. I 
also consider that it was fair and reasonable for it to conclude on the basis of that 
assessment that they could afford a loan with monthly repayments of £111.23 at that time. 
The loan was repaid in January 2009, ten months after it was made to Mr and Mrs H, and 
Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for them when it was made to 
them or that theyve experienced any financial difficulties since then.
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs H asked GE Money for any information about 
its credit checks before their representatives letter to this service in March 2021  thirteen 
years after the loan was made to them - and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
them to have raised any concerns about the credit checks or the affordability of the loan 
before then. 
Im not persuaded that the outcome that GE Money reached on Mr and Mrs Hs claims was 
unfair or unreasonable or that theres enough evidence to show that it acted incorrectly in its 
dealings with Mr and Mrs H. I sympathise with them for the issues that theyve had with their 
timeshare and the difficulties that theyve experienced, but for the reasons set out above, I 
find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require GE Money to refund to Mr and 
Mrs H any of the money that they paid under the loan agreement, to pay them any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision before 9 March 2023.
