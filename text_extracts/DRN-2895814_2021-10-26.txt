The complaint
Ms C complains that HSBC UK Bank Plc (HSBC) would not open an Advance Account (AA) 
for her although she felt she met the criteria for it.
What happened
The details of this case are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again here. 
The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by our adjudicator.
In my view HSBC is entitled to set the criteria for a customer to qualify for one of its 
products. And it is entitled to decline a customers application if the customer doesnt meet 
those criteria. The requirement for an AA was that a customer must have a regular income of 
£1,750 a month or £10,500 every six months.
Ms Cs income was less than this, but she says she could have met the criteria from her 
other savings. HSBC has clarified that this is an income requirement and it does not accept 
a top up from a customers liquid assets.
I agree with Ms C that HSBCs application form and its response to her complaint could have 
been clearer. And HSBC has apologised for this. But, in my view, HSBC hasnt done 
anything substantially wrong in this matter and I dont think any further action is required.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Ms Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 November 2021.
