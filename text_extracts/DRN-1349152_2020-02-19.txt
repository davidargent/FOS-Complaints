The complaint
Mr K says MYJAR Limited lent to him irresponsibly. He says the loans were unaffordable 
and unsustainable. Hes not satisfied that MYJARs checks went far enough. Mr K says that 
if they had made better checks it wouldve seen that he was in financial difficulty and not lent 
to him.

What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr K 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MYJAR should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Ks complaint 
in part and have explained why below.
I can see that Mr K has made reference to other ombudsmans decisions. But I should say 
that I am required to look at each case on its individual merits. And whilst there may be 
similarities between complaints, consumers individual circumstances are often very different. 
So it isnt right to say that, just because one complaint reaches an outcome that another 
complaint, which may seem similar, would also reach the same outcome.  
Mr K didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 3 and loan 6. And 
MYJAR didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 9 to 15. Because of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So I wont be making a 
decision about this lending. But they were part of the borrowing relationship Mr K had with 
MYJAR. So they are something I will take into account when considering the other loans he 
took.
So Im only looking at loans 4 and 5 and loans 7 and 8 as part of this decision. 
loans 4 and 5
By loan 4 Mr K had been borrowing for over three months. Hed taken new borrowing very 
soon after repaying the earlier loans. And the amounts he was borrowing had stayed the 
same at £100. So I think MYJAR couldve realised at that time that Mr K may have some longer term 
financial problems rather than just using the loans to help with a temporary cash flow 
problem. MYJAR shouldve also become concerned about whether it knew enough about Mr 
Ks true financial situation.
I think that it wouldve been proportionate to fully review Mr Ks financial situation by loan 4. 
And I think that it needed to verify the information it found out where possible. This is to 
make sure Mr K was in position to make the repayments sustainably.
I dont think MYJAR did this. It did credit checks and asked Mr K about his income and 
expenditure but it didnt build up a full picture of Mr Ks circumstances. So I need to think 
about what MYJAR wouldve seen if it had carried out proportionate checks. 
Mr K has provided some information about his financial circumstances such as his bank 
statements, credit reports, and information on the loans he took with other businesses. I 
accept that this isnt exactly what MYJAR wouldve seen at the time. But I think it wouldve 
found out similar information if it had made proportionate checks, so I think its reasonable to 
rely on it.
This shows that Mr K was having problems managing his money. He had a number of other 
creditors as he says. And he was regularly borrowing and repaying significant amounts to 
other short term lenders. 
I think that MYJAR wouldve found out this information if it had made proportionate checks.  
And I think MYJAR wouldve seen Mr K wouldnt have been able repay the loans in a 
sustainable way. So I think that MYJAR shouldnt have given loans 4 and 5 to Mr K and I 
think hes lost out as a result of this. So Im upholding Mr Ks complaint about loans 4 and 5. 
loans 7 and 8
The first consideration here is whether the break in lending is long enough for it to be 
reasonable for MYJAR to assume that Mr Ks circumstances had improved by this second 
chain of lending. 
In the first group of loans (1 to 5). Mr K took five loans over a four-month period. The loan 
amounts were modest and, as far as I can see, there were no significant repayment 
problems. Mr K then stopped borrowing from MYJAR for a period of around ten months. This 
was longer than he had borrowed for. So, I think it was reasonable for MYJAR to treat Mr K 
as if he was a new customer at loan 6. 
Ive seen a record of the information Mr K provided when he completed his loan application. 
Mr K said he had a monthly income of between £1,400 and £1,800 and he had regular 
monthly outgoings of just over £1,100 at most. This left him with a reasonable amount to 
make the loan repayments. So they wouldve seemed affordable to Mr K.  
I can see that over this time Mr K was in receipt of benefits. But I dont think its enough for 
MYJAR not to lend for this reason alone. And the credit report information that MYJAR has 
supplied showed that Mr K didnt have any overdue accounts. And he hadnt opened any 
other accounts in the last 3 months before loan 7. 
He did open some accounts with other lenders before loan 8, but there was a significant time 
between the start of loan 7 and the start of loan 8 as loan 7 had a six month term. Mr K has 
verified that he did borrow and repay a number of loans within this time. He also had some 
outstanding loans to repay around the same time he was due to repay loan 8. So there were some indications that Mr Ks financial situation was deteriorating before loan 
8. But I dont think this was clear enough to MYJAR for it to have made further checks before 
approving this loan. Mr K wasnt in employment, but he was in receipt of a reasonable 
benefit income. MYJAR knew that he was likely to have had increased his borrowing with 
other lenders over the time loan 7 was running. But he had repaid these loans without 
problem. And it isnt clear from what MYJAR saw that he was due to repay significant 
amounts to other lenders.  
Mr K did increase the amount he borrowed at loan 7 but he took the loan over a longer 
period. And the amount he borrowed reduced for loan 8. So I dont think its reasonable to 
say that this pattern shows Mr K was in financial difficulty at this early point in this lending 
chain. 
I havent seen any further information that shows its likely MYJAR was made aware of any 
financial problems Mr K mightve been having at this point. And I havent seen anything that 
wouldve prompted it to investigate Mr Ks circumstances further. So, I think it was 
reasonable for MYJAR to rely on the information it obtained.
So overall, in these circumstances, I think the assessments MYJAR did for loans 7 and 8 
were proportionate. So I think MYJARs decisions to lend for loans 7 and 8 were reasonable 
and Im not upholding Mr Ks complaint about them.
Putting things right
 refund all interest and charges Mr K paid on loans 4 and 5 and loans 9 to 15;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information about loans 4 and 5 and 9 and 10 from Mr Ks 
credit file;
the number of loans taken from 11 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So all entries about loans 11 to 15 should be removed from Mr Ks 
credit file.
 
If Mr K still owes MYJAR any of the principal balance he borrowed on his final loan MYJAR 
should remove all the interest and charges applied to the outstanding balance. 
MYJAR should then re-work the account as if all payments made by Mr K went to towards 
the principal. But importantly, MYJAR needs to make sure that Mr K doesnt repay more than 
the principal amount borrowed. 
If after doing this Mr K hasnt repaid the principal he borrowed MYJAR can deduct this from 
the remainder of the compensation. If, Mr K has already paid enough to repay the principal 
then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple* interest from the date of 
payment to the date of settlement
And if MYJAR no longer owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction due to the amount 
owed, then it should buy it back. If it doesnt then it isnt entitled to make any deductions for it 
from the amount it needs to pay Mr K.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr K a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decisionFor the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mr Ks complaint.
MYJAR Limited should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 March 2020.
