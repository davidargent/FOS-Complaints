K821x#15complaint
Mrs S complains that Elevate Credit International Limited  (trading as Sunny) lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mrs S was given 34 loans by Sunny between May 2016 and August 2018. Each of the loans 
was due to be repaid  in 14 monthly instalments but Mrs S generally  repaid the loans much  
earlier than had been agreed. At times  Mrs S had up to four loans outstanding  at the same 
time. All of Mrs Ss loans have been  fully repaid and a summary  of her borrowing from 
Sunny is shown as an appendix to this decision.
Mrs Ss complaint has been  assessed by one of our adjudicators.  He didnt think Sunny had 
been wrong to give loans  1 to 5 to Mrs S. But he didnt think  Sunny  should have agreed to 
lend the remaining loans. So he asked Sunny to pay Mrs S some  compensation.
Sunny offered to pay the suggested compensation in relation to loans 9 to 34. But it didnt 
agree that it shouldnt  have given loans 6 to 8 to Mrs S.  Mrs S didnt accept Sunnys offer 
so, as the complaint hasnt been  resolved  informally, it has been passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to decide. This is the last stage  of our process. If Mrs S accepts my decision it 
is legally  binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mrs S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ref: DRN80612042There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs S could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the FCAs Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines 
sustainable as being without undue  difficulties and in particular the customer should be able 
to make repayments on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments; as well as 
without having  to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  
or it ought fairly  and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ss complaint.
Sunny did some checks before it lent to Mrs S. It asked her for details  of her income, and her 
normal expenditure. And it checked  her credit  file before agreeing  the loans. Ive seen a 
summary of those credit checks  and I dont think they showed  anything that should have 
caused additional concerns to Sunny.
As I mentioned earlier each of Mrs Ss loans was repayable over a 14 month period. So the 
amounts that Mrs S needed  to repay  each time were smaller than if shed taken a normal 
payday loan. But of course she was committing to making those repayments over a 
significant period.  And at times Mrs S had a number of loans outstanding together.  So Ive 
needed to consider the total amount  that Mrs S needed to repay to Sunny each  month.
I think the fact that Mrs S typically repaid her loans much earlier than planned  should  have 
caused some concerns  to Sunny. That might be the sort of behaviour  that would indicate 
that someone was facing  problems managing their money and needing  to refinance loans on 
a regular basis. So Ive also taken that into account  when  looking  at whether Sunny should 
have given the loans to Mrs S.
I dont think the checks  Ive described above  were sufficient for any of the loans. Mrs S was 
committing to repay  her loans over a significant period of time. I think Sunny should have 
taken great  care to ensure that her finances  were stable enough to support such  a lengthy 
commitment. So I dont think it was reasonable for Sunny to base its affordability  
assessment solely  on the information Mrs S was providing about her finances. 
Before agreeing each loan I think Sunny should have taken steps to independently verify 
Mrs Ss true financial position.  We asked Mrs S for copies of her bank statements so we 
could see what better  checks would have shown Sunny. She didnt  provide  these  to us. So 
Im not able to say that better checks would have shown Sunny that it shouldnt lend to 
Mrs S.
But looking  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs S I think  by loan 6 the 
lender should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise  
harmful. And so Sunny  should have realised  that it shouldnt provide further loans. 
Ref: DRN80612043I say this because:
This was now Mrs Ss sixth loan request in just over four months. But this request  
showed a marked  increase in her borrowing. The loan she asked to take was 
significantly greater than those  that had gone  before. 
Each of the loans  Mrs S had taken had been  repayable over a period of 14 months.  
But she had paid off each of the first four loans significantly earlier than planned, and 
borrowed again very shortly afterwards.  I think that pattern of frequent borrowing and 
repaying early should have indicated to Sunny that Mrs S was most  likely having 
significant problems  managing her money. 
Following loan 6 Mrs S generally had multiple loans active  at the same  time. And she 
was regularly asking  for a new loan on the same  day that shed repaid previous 
borrowing. So Sunny  ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Mrs S was 
having to borrow  further to cover  the hole repaying  her previous loans was leaving in 
her finances and that Mrs Ss indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
I think that Mrs S lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ss indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mrs Ss 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So I dont  think Sunny should  have  agreed  to lend to Mrs S from loan 6 onwards. Sunny 
needs to pay Mrs S some compensation.
putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mrs S after, and including, the loan that 
she took on 30 September  2016 (loan  6). So for each of those loans Sunny should;
Refund any interest and charges paid by Mrs S on the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 34 should be removed from Mrs Ss 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs S a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN80612044my final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Mrs Ss complaint and direct Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things  right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 December 2019.
