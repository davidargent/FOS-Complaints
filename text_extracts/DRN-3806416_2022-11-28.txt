The complaint
Mr T complains that Tesco Personal Finance plc, trading as Tesco Bank, wont refund to him 
the outstanding amount that he paid for some bi-fold doors. 
 
What happened
Mr T ordered three bi-fold doors from a supplier in March 2022  two of which were bespoke 
orders  and the total price was £6,000. He paid £600 to the supplier using his Tesco Bank 
credit card in March 2022 and the balance was paid by other means (including by a bank 
transfer that he made to his partner for her to make a payment to the supplier later that 
month). The estimated delivery time was three to four weeks but the delivery was delayed. 
Mr T asked to cancel the order but the supplier said that the order couldnt be cancelled.
Mr T contacted Tesco Bank and it made a chargeback claim for the £600 that hed paid to 
the supplier using his Tesco Bank credit card. The chargeback claim was defended by the 
supplier but, as the goods hadnt been delivered, Tesco Bank refunded the £600 to Mr Ts 
credit card account. It considered his claim for a refund of the balance of the amount that 
hed paid for the doors under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that, 
although the supplier was unable to deliver the goods within the initial delivery time given at 
the point of sale, it had never provided a guaranteed delivery date. It said that the doors 
were available to be delivered and it didnt consider that there had been a breach of contract. 
Mr T wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld. She said that Tesco 
Bank had acted fairly when declining the section 75 claim as no misrepresentation or breach 
of contract had occurred. She said that the supplier didnt provide a guaranteed delivery date 
and that its website says that orders arent cancellable.
Mr T has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He has responded in 
detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, that: 
he ordered three sets of doors, one of which was a standard, off-the-shelf, order but 
it hasnt been delivered and this order was cancellable so the supplier hasnt incurred 
a financial loss;
he cancelled the order for the other doors before they were made so the supplier 
wont have suffered a financial loss and should accept the cancellation of the order 
for those doors;
the supplier claims that the doors have been made but refuses to deliver them so is 
in breach of contract and refuses to provide evidence that the doors have been 
made;
Tesco Bank has found in his favour and confirmed that the supplier is in breach of 
contract and wouldnt have refunded the £600 deposit if it wasnt in breach of 
contract;
its his opinion that the supplier is refusing to deliver the order as it hasnt made the 
doors; 
hes happy to pay the remaining £600 to complete the order and allow the supplier to 
deliver all three sets of doors within five working days but only if this service ensures 
that Tesco Bank issues a full refund if it doesnt;
orders are cancellable because customers have the right to return an item if its 
faulty, or not as described; and
the remainder of his money should be refunded under section 75.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Tesco Bank made a chargeback claim for the £600 deposit that Mr T had paid to the 
supplier  it says that the claim was challenged by the supplier but the claim was 
taken to arbitration as the doors hadnt been delivered and it refunded the £600 to 
Mr T;
I consider that Tesco Bank acted correctly in making a chargeback claim in these 
circumstances and Mr T has received a refund of the £600 that he paid using his 
Tesco Bank credit card and I consider that to have been fair and reasonable;
Tesco Bank considered Mr Ts claim for a refund of the balance of the money that 
hed paid for the doors under section 75 - in certain circumstances, section 75 gives 
a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Ms Ts complaint about Tesco Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier and that Tesco 
Banks response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not 
determining the outcome of Mr Ts claim under section 75 as only a court would be 
able to do that;
Mr T ordered the doors in mid-March 2022 and the order invoice that was accepted 
by him said: Our lead delivery time at the moment is around 3/4 weeks  I dont 
consider that the supplier guaranteed that the doors would be delivered within four 
week or that it was reasonable for Mr T to expect that the doors would be delivered in 
less than four weeks; 
there was a delay in the doors being delivered but the supplier told Mr T in May 2022 
that the doors were ready to be delivered  Mr T said that that was too late, hed got 
alternatives doors from another supplier and wanted to cancel his order - but Im not 
persuaded that there had been a breach of contract by the supplier as a result of the 
delayed delivery of the doors;
the supplier said that the order wasnt cancellable  and its terms and conditions say: 
Bespoke & made to measure items cannot be cancelled  I dont consider that to be 
unfair or unreasonable;
the order invoice also say: No goods will be delivered until payment is made in full - 
but the supplier hasnt received full payment from Mr T as £600 was refunded to Mr T 
as a result of the chargeback claim;the supplier said that the doors were available for delivery and Ive seen no evidence 
to support Mr Ts claim that the doors havent been made;
I can understand Mr Ts frustration that none of the doors have been delivered to him 
but he told the supplier that he was cancelling his order and he hasnt paid for the 
order in full and Im not persuaded that the supplier has breached the contract by not 
delivering the doors to him;
Tesco Bank made a chargeback claim because the doors hadnt been delivered but 
that doesnt mean that theres been a breach of contract by the supplier and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence in these circumstances to show that theres 
been a breach of contract;
I consider that Tesco Banks response to Mr Ts section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require it to 
refund to him the balance of the money that he paid for the doors, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint; and
if Mr T now wants the doors to be delivered to him, I suggest that he pays the 
outstanding £600 to the supplier and asks it to deliver the doors to him  if it doesnt 
do so he may then be able to make a section 75 claim to Tesco Bank because the 
supplier may then be in breach of contract  but Im unable to require the supplier to 
deliver the doors to him within five working days or to require Tesco Bank to make a 
full refund if it doesnt do so.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 December 2022.
