The complaint
Mr S complains that Bank of Scotland plc trading as Halifax (Halifax) returned his payments.
What happened
Mr S wanted to make an investment of £5,003. On 13 January 2020, he made four debit 
card payments of £5,003 to the investment company. Two were authorised by Halifax, but 
the amounts werent collected by the investment company. Two were declined. He wrote a 
cheque for £5,003. This was returned unpaid on 17 January 2020. It was paid on 21 January 
2020.
Mr S complained that the debit card payments had been declined, and the cheque wasnt 
paid. He said he had enough money in his account to meet them.
Halifax replied in January 2020. They said they approved two debit card payments of £5,003 
on 13 January 2020. This left a balance of £836.70 as they were shown as pending 
transactions. Mr S then tried to make another debit card payment of £5,003  this was 
declined as there wasnt enough money in his account. Mr S also tried to make a debit card 
payment with another card. This was declined as it was an old, expired card. On 17 January 
2020, Mr S wrote a cheque for £5,003  this wasnt paid as there still wasnt enough money 
in the account due to the pending transactions. The two original payments made on 13 
January 2020 werent actually taken by the investment company - so the money was 
released back to Mr S account on 20 January 2020. This meant the cheque was paid from 
his account the following day. So, the investment company received the money then.
Mr S brought his complaint to this service. Our investigator looked at it. She could see what 
had happened. Halifax couldnt make the payment - there wasnt enough money in Mr S 
account due to the pending debit card payments. She felt that Halifax hadnt done anything 
wrong.
Mr S asked that his complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see why Mr S is upset  I can see from his statements that he thought he had a 
balance of about £11,000 credit in his account on 13 January 2020 when he tried to make 
the payments. 
Ive seen Mr Ss statements and what happened in Halifaxs systems. I can see he made two 
debit card payments, each for £5003, to the investment company on 13 January 2020. What 
happens here is Halifax agrees those payments  and waits for the investment company to 
claim the money. While they do that, the available balance  how much money Mr S could 
use  was reduced by £10,006. Because Halifax were expecting to have to pay this amount 
out. So, when he tried to make a third debit card payment of £5,003, there wasnt enough 
money available in Mr S account - so it was declined. And when Mr S then wrote a cheque 
for £5,003 four days later, the pending transactions were still outstanding - so that was also 
not paid. Separately, Mr S tried to make another payment with an old card, and this was 
declined because it had expired.
In the event, the investment company didnt claim the money on the first two debit card 
payments  we dont know why - and so that money was released back into Mr S account 
and the cheque was paid  and the investment made. 
I understand that Mr S will be disappointed with my decision  but what Halifax did was 
normal banking practice and I dont think they acted unreasonably or unfairly here  so I 
wont be asking them to do anymore.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 March 2021.
