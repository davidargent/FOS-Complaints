The complaint
Mr M complains that Santander UK plc (Santander) reported missed payments on his credit 
file whilst he was on a debt management plan (dmp). He would like the dmp correctly 
reported on his credit file.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again here 
instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions
Mr M has given us  credit file extracts showing markers for missed payments for his 
Santander account for September 2018 through to February 2019. There is no 
dispute that Mr M was on an agreed dmp during this time nor that payments 
shouldnt have been recorded as missed during that time.
I have looked at the evidence Santander has sent us which includes the information it 
sent to the credit reference agencies (CRAs) on Mr Ms account. That shows that 
during the period in question it correctly reported Mr Ms account status as DM(debt 
management). Santander has explained that it sends all three CRAs  the same 
information but that they might not display it in the way that Santander has sent it. 
So, whilst I do appreciate Mr Ms frustration, I cant say that Santander is at faut as , 
from what I have seen, it sent the correct information to the CRAs
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 September 2022.
