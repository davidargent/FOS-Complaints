The complaint
Mrs B complains that she didnt get help from National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) 
when she was in persistent debt.
What happened 
Mrs B had a credit card from NatWest. The limit was £14,300. In March 2020, the balance 
was £14,132 and in September 2020, the balance was £13,914. NatWest wrote to Mrs B in 
March 2020 to say she was in persistent debt. Mrs B then contacted NatWest and the 
persistent debt process was postponed. NatWest then wrote to Mrs B on 3 September 2020 
and 28 September 2020. Her account was closed on 12 October 2020. The balance on her 
October 2020 statement had reduced to £3,793.
Mrs B complained that NatWest hadnt supported her when she was in persistent debt. She 
said the options given werent helpful, and she hadnt been given any notice her account 
was to close. Her statements didnt say her limit had been cancelled. As a result, she had a 
transaction declined.
In February 2021, NatWest said Mrs Bs account had been closed in line with their 
processes for customers in persistent debt. These were in place to protect customers who 
paid more in fees, interest, and charges than theyd repaid though monthly payments to their 
accounts  leading to customers paying back more in the long run. NatWest said theyd 
contacted Mrs B in March 2020 about this, following which Mrs B complained. They then 
contacted Mrs B again on 3 September 2020 and 28 September 2020. Her account was 
closed on 12 October 2020 and NatWest said theyd written to Mrs B to advise her of that. 
And so  NatWest said theyd acted fairly.
Mrs B brought her complaint to us. Our investigator agreed with NatWest. She said Mrs Bs 
account was closed in line with the rules for customers in persistent debt and NatWest had 
advised her about this. NatWest also had the right to close accounts in their terms and 
conditions. 
Mrs B didnt agree and asked that an ombudsman look at her complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In asking for a decision on this complaint, Mrs B has raised some further points about 
another complaint she brought to our service and which was subject to a final decision in 
August 2022. I wont be commenting on that decision, as under the rules that apply to us a 
decision is final.
Mrs B was in persistent debt  and NatWest argue that her account was closed in line with 
their persistent debt processes. So, Ive looked to see if that was fair and reasonable, and 
whether NatWests communications were clear and not misleading  which is what the 
Financial Conduct Authority say must be the case.
At the outset, let me say that this service exists to resolve individual disputes between
customers and financial businesses  in this case, Mrs B and NatWest. We are not the 
regulators of NatWest  thats the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)  so Im not going to 
comment on the validity of the persistent debt scheme. Thats for the FCA and if Mrs B 
wishes to challenge it, then she must approach them. But  the FCA have set out the 
persistent debt rules, and NatWest must follow them. Its our role to ensure theyve done so 
fairly and reasonably.
The FCAs persistent debt rules are set out in the FCA handbook, CONC 6.7.27. These say 
(in summary) that firms such as NatWest must look at the accounts of borrowers to ensure 
theyre reducing their debts and therefore, not paying too much interest. And so  where a 
borrower is paying more in interest and fees than they are paying towards reducing the 
amount of the debt, then a repayment plan should be put in place to deal with this. And, 
where this cant be agreed, the card may be suspended or account closed  to stop 
customers from increasing their debts further. The intention of the rules is to ensure that 
customers are protected from paying too much interest  and in some cases, never actually 
repaying their debts. This typically happens if customers only pay the minimum amount each 
month, while still spending on their cards. 
I can see that NatWest wrote to Mrs B in March 2020 to say she was in persistent debt. They 
suggested a number pf payment plans  whereby she could pay off the debt over periods of 
up to four years. NatWest offered to discuss options with Mrs B, but the letter also said 
we may stop further spending and close your account to allow your balance to reduce 
quicker I can then see that Mrs B contacted NatWest to say the options werent helpful. 
NatWest then postponed the process until September 2020  to allow her to consider her 
options. On 1 April 2020, there was a discussion with Mrs B and she was advised to contact 
NatWests specialist team (who support customers in financial difficulty)  to see if they 
could help. The notes on Mrs Bs account say they she would have to complete an income 
and expenditure form  so NatWest could see what her circumstances were. 
Ive considered what happened here  as businesses have an obligation to treat customers 
in financial difficulty sympathetically and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says that 
businesses like NatWest should treat customers in difficulties with forbearance and due 
consideration. For example, a business might suspend or waive interest, accept lower 
payments, or defer them, and allow customers more time to repay their debt.  And so  if 
Mrs B had come forward with evidence of financial difficulty  with an income and 
expenditure assessment, NatWest may have been able to help her with a low interest (or 
zero interest) payment plan. That wouldve been subject to NatWests assessment of her 
situation, so I cant say whether such a plan wouldve been agreed or not. But  I cant see 
that Mrs B didnt contact NatWest as theyd suggested she did, and so that option didnt 
materialise. But I think NatWest did meet their obligations here  as they did offer Mrs B a 
discussion with their support team.
I can see that as nothing had happened, NatWest then continued with their persistent debt 
process. And on 3 September 2020 wrote to Mrs B We previously wrote to you to advise 
that your credit card would be closed if we did not hear back from you. This was due to us 
taking steps to help you avoid having debt on your credit card for a long period of time, 
which is often an expensive way to borrow money. This letter is reminding you that we will 
stop further spending on your card and close your account in 30 days time if you dont 
contact us. NatWests records show they then contacted Mrs B again on 28 September 
2020 to say her account would be closed in seven days time.And then, on 12 October 2020, NatWest confirmed to Mrs B that her account had been 
closed. The letter said As we advised in our recent correspondence about your persistent 
debt balance and the options available to repay, we have now closed your credit card 
account and you will no longer be able to use your card. This is intended to help you repay 
your credit card account balance more quickly saving you money in the longer term.
And so  I think NatWest gave clear notice of what was going to happen to Mrs Bs account, 
and why. And they then confirmed her account was closed and no further spending was 
allowed.
However, I did notice that the limit on Mrs Bs statements remained at £14,300  so I can 
accept that Mrs B may have been confused by that. We asked NatWest about this and they 
said that it was their normal process to leave the limit showing on statements in these 
circumstances. Ive considered this point  and whether it is an important one in the context 
of Mrs Bs complaint. And here  because the letters sent by NatWest were clear  saying 
that Mrs Bs card would be stopped, on balance, I dont think this point alone persuades me 
to uphold Mrs Bs complaint.  
I can see that Mrs B feels strongly about her complaint and has argued it strongly with 
NatWest and ourselves. She will therefore be disappointed by my decision. But Im not going 
to ask NatWest to do anything here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2022.
