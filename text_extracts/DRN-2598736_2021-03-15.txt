The complaint
Mr M complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) regularly increased his credit card limit when it 
shouldve been apparent that he wasnt able to afford the additional debt.  
What happened
The history of this complaint is well known to both parties, so Ive summarised events below.
Mr M opened a credit card account with NewDay in 2013 and the initial credit limit 
was £100. This limit was increased incrementally over several years, reaching 
£1,650 by October 2015.
In May 2016 there was one increase of the limit to £2,450. Then across 2017 there 
were two further limit increases, bringing the total to £4,450.
Mr M says this lending was irresponsible and unaffordable, and it led him to fall 
behind with payments and eventually led to him entering a repayment plan. 
Mr M complained to NewDay and asked it to reconsider the interest and charges it 
had applied. It disagreed, saying it hadnt been told of any financial difficulties, and it 
had acted fairly when increasing the credit limit and applying interest and charges.
Our investigator considered the complaint and upheld it. She felt NewDays offer and 
agreements to increase Mr Ms credit limit from May 2016 onwards were 
inappropriate. She said NewDay should refund any interest and charges from the 
date of this increase.
Mr M accepted our investigators findings but NewDay didnt. It reiterated the 
increases were in line with its lending criteria and Mr Ms circumstances were 
considered. And it didnt agree it was responsible for any financial difficulties Mr M 
had experienced. 
As NewDay disagreed, the complaint was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding the complaint for the same reasons as the investigator. Ill 
explain why:
The relevant rules and guidance from the Financial Conduct Authoritys (FCA) 
Consumer Credit sourcebook required NewDay to undertake a reasonable 
assessment of Mr Ms creditworthiness each time they increased his credit card limit, 
particularly where cumulative credit increases are significant, as they are here.
NewDay has its own processes and approach to risk when providing credit, but I 
have to consider whether it has met the requirement of undertaking a reasonable 
assessment in these particular circumstances. 
In line with the above rules, Ive looked at whether NewDay reasonably considered 
the information it held for Mr M, his ability to make repayments each month, any 
information it could obtain from credit reference agencies and his credit file.
I agree with our investigators findings, and Im satisfied NewDay responsibly 
provided the credit card in 2013, and subsequent increases up until May 2016 were 
reasonable. Mr M has accepted this so I wont repeat the details again here.
So Ive considered NewDays actions from this point onwards. And whether it carried 
out a reasonable assessment of Mr M each time it increased his card limit.
In May 2016 NewDay contacted Mr M and offered to increase the limit further. From 
this point, the credit card exceeded its limit in each of the next five months. Then in 
April 2017, NewDay agreed to an increase of £1,000. And around four months later, 
NewDay agreed to increase the limit by a further £1,000. I think Mr Ms requests for 
increases were happening more frequently than Id normally expect to see, which 
suggests a dependency on the credit card facility.
 NewDay was aware Mr M had a payday loan from March 2016 but as the loan 
hadnt gone into arrears or defaulted, it said it didnt affect its lending decision. I think 
this financial commitment shouldve been considered further by NewDay in the 
circumstances as it suggested a dependency on this lending. 
From the figures NewDay have provided, it appears each time the credit limit was 
increased, this increase was then spent as a cash spend. I think this, combined with 
the frequency of the limit increases, ought to have highlighted to NewDay that Mr M 
was either requiring the money to support his day to day living or pay other bills with 
the cash.
Overall, whilst I acknowledge the NewDays increases from May 2016 may have been in line 
with its own lending criteria, Im not satisfied sufficient checks were carried out in the specific 
circumstances of this cases. I say this in light of the reasons Ive given above and Mr Ms 
card usage around this time which showed near or over the limit balances. 
  
My final decision
For these reasons Im upholding this complaint. And NewDay Ltd must do the following.
Refund all interest and charges payments from May 2016 onwards to the credit card 
debt.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2021.
