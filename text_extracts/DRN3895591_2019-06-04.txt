K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that Lloyds Bank  Plc (Lloyds) mis-sold him a payment protection insurance  
(PPI) policy.  
background
This complaint is about a single premium  PPI policy taken out in 1996 when Mr C applied for 
a loan. 
Our adjudicator didnt  think Mr Cs complaint should be upheld. Mr C didnt agree with our 
adjudicator and so the complaint has been  passed  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Cs case.  
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Cs complaint. I explain why below.
Mr C and Lloyds recall  the sale being  made at a meeting. The policy was sold over twenty 
three years ago so it isnt surprising that neither Mr C nor Lloyds still have copies of the 
paperwork completed at the time. I also have to take into account that memories can fade 
over time. In cases like this, where  the evidence is incomplete or contradictory, I have to 
make my decision  on the balance of probabilities   that is, to decide  what  is most likely to 
have happened. 
Lloyds has provided  a sample  loan agreement which it says was in use at the time the policy 
was sold. I think its more  likely than not Mr C was asked to sign an agreement like this to 
get his loan funds.
On the loan agreement there is a section called Optional  Loan  Repayment Protection and it 
has Yes and No boxes  in that section  to indicate  if cover  is required. From what we 
understand about the way these  policies were sold, this part of the loan documentation 
wouldve been completed after a conversation between the representative and Mr C. Ive 
considered what  Mr C has said, but I think its more likely than not he would have  been  
aware he had a choice about  buying the PPI policy and that he chose to take it out. 
Lloyds recommended the PPI to Mr C, so it needed  to check  that it was right for him. From 
what Mr C has told us about his circumstances at the time, I think  it was. Mr C was eligible 
for the policy and the main exclusions around  employment and pre-existing medical 
conditions didnt apply  to him. 
Mr C has said that he had some  modest sick pay from his employer, but this would not have 
lasted beyond three months.  And Mr C told us he had no other  means he could have  relied 
on if Mr C was off work sick for a long time, or if he lost his job. The policy couldve paid out 
for up to 12 months if Mr C lost his job, and for the remaining term of the loan if Mr C was too 
ill to work.  The policy  provided cover  in addition to any employer benefits Mr C had. So, I 
think the policy could  have been useful  to Mr C. 
Ref: DRN38955912I think Lloyds couldve explained the cost of the policy better than it did. Lloyds didnt include 
information on the amount of interest  which would be payable on the PPI policy  over the loan 
term. But even if it had, I think Mr C would still have  bought it. Given how long the policy 
could have paid out for, if Mr C made  a successful  claim he couldve got back  quite a bit 
more than he paid for it. 
Mr C would have got back only a limited refund of the PPI premium  if he cancelled  the policy 
early. I dont  know if Lloyds thought about  this when it recommended  the policy, or if it 
explained the situation clearly to Mr C. But I havent seen anything to suggest he thought 
hed repay  the loan early. So I dont think this meant the policy wasnt right for him. 
I havent seen  anything to make  me think the policy was unaffordable to Mr C or that he had 
a need to keep costs  down.
Its possible that the information Lloyds  gave Mr C about the PPI wasnt as clear  as it should 
have been. But for the same reasons that I think the policy was suitable, I dont think  better  
information wouldve  stopped him from buying  it.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Cs complaint  about  Lloyds Bank  Plc.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 July 2019.
