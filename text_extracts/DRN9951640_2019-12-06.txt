K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  was 
irresponsible to lend him money.
background
Mr H took out 17 Sunny  loans between July 2017  and September 2018. Mr H mainly says 
that he didnt understand  the costs  or how much  interest was charged  and he had problems 
paying. Theres a table at the end of my decision with more information about  these  loans.
Our adjudicator recommended  that Mr Hs complaint should be upheld in part. In summary,  
he thought that it was reasonable of Sunny to agree the first six loans - but that Sunny 
shouldnt have agreed loans 7 to 17. The adjudicator recommended that Sunny refund  all 
interest and charges that Mr H had paid on loans  7 to 17. And the adjudicator said Sunny 
should remove any information about loans  7 to 17 from Mr Hs credit file. 
Sunny didnt agree with the adjudicators  recommendation and said that it hadnt been wrong 
to offer any of the loans. It mentioned that Mr H never missed a payment or made any late 
payments and that hed paid off all of the loans early, saving on interest.  
The complaint came to me to decide. I issued a provisional decision. 
what I said in my provisional decision
Here are some of the main things I said. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In practice 
this means that it shouldve carried  out proportionate  checks to make sure Mr H could repay  
the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN99516402Sunny was required to establish whether Mr H could  sustainably repay his loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were  affordable on a strict pounds  and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Sunny has told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr H. It asked Mr H to provide 
details of his income  and to tell Sunny what he normally  spent  each month. And Sunny also 
carried out checks on Mr Hs credit file. 
I agree  with the adjudicator that it wasnt unreasonable of Sunny to agree the first six loans 
based on the information it held about Mr H. As Mr H hasnt raised any objection  to the 
adjudicators recommendation in relation to loans 1 through to 6, I dont think  that I need to 
say more about them. 
I think by loan 7 in December 2017  Sunny  shouldve been concerned that Mr H had been  
indebted every month since  his first loan in July 2017. And loan 7 was the third big loan hed 
asked for  after having borrowed  smaller loans in between. So Sunny ought to have  
considered whether it was any longer reasonable to base its lending decision on the 
information Mr H was providing. I think it would have been proportionate for Sunny to have 
taken steps to independently  check the true state of his finances. 
But I havent seen  anything in the information  available to me which shows that Sunny 
wouldve decided not to agree the loan 7 even if it had it done  the further checks  into Mr Hs 
financial circumstances that I think it ought  to have  carried out. So, unlike the adjudicator, 
I dont think Ive seen  enough overall to say that Sunny was wrong to lend loan 7 to Mr H.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Mr Hs lending with Sunny to see if there was a point at 
which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny shouldve realised that it wasnt reasonable to lend more 
money to Mr H. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Hs case, I think  that this point was reached by 
loan 8. I say this because: 
by the time he took out loan 8 in January 2018  Mr H had been repeatedly borrowing 
from Sunny for a period  of almost six months. Hed been more or less continuously 
indebted to Sunny  during  this period  as there  hadnt been any significant break in the 
chain of lending.  So Sunny shouldve  seen that it was likely Mr H had to borrow again  
to cover the hole left by repaying  each  earlier loan.  This suggests that Mr H couldnt  
sustainably afford  to repay what he had borrowed without borrowing again. 
Ref: DRN99516403Mr H took out some  loans whilst he was still paying for previous borrowing and he 
repaid all the loans early. For example,  loans  2 and 3 were taken out whilst loan 1 
was still running. He took out loan 4 for £900 (which was almost as much as hed 
borrowed at the start of loan 1) around three weeks or so after paying  loan 1. And 
around three weeks or so after that, he borrowed another £150   when he was still 
paying for loan 4. Loan 6 was for a relatively small amount  but it appears that he 
took this loan out and paid it off the same day. And loan 7 looks  like it was paid 
around 5 days or so after it was taken out. So this all suggests  that his finances were 
volatile and Mr H was having problems managing his money and wasnt  using the 
loans for their intended purpose. 
Looking at this pattern  of lending overall,  I think Sunny shouldve  realised by loan 8 
that there wasnt any indication that Mr Hs finances had moved on from whatever 
situation had required his previous loans. And he wasnt using the loans for their 
intended purpose. It was unlikely he was borrowing  to meet  a temporary  shortfall in 
income  rather, it looked like he had an ongoing need for the money and he wasnt 
making any inroads  into the amount he owed the lender.  
I appreciate that Mr H repaid his loans earlier than the agreed  term. But successfully 
repaying his loans doesnt mean he managed to do so in a sustainable  way. And 
borrowing and repaying this number of loans  early suggests to me that Mr Hs 
finances were unpredictable  and not stable.   
I think that Mr H lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards. This is because:
 these loans  had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short term use over an extended period of time. 
 this number  of loans, combined  with the total length of time Mr H had been borrowing from 
Sunny, was likely  to have  negative  implications  on his ability to access  mainstream credit. 
This potentially kept Mr H in the market for these high-cost loans.  
So Im planning  to uphold Mr Hs complaint about loans 8 to 17.
what the parties said in response to my provisional  decision 
Sunny has reviewed its position  and is now willing to uphold part of Mr Hs complaint and 
offer him a refund of £71.36 in full and final settlement .
Our adjudicator communicated this offer to Mr H. He told us he doesnt acept this offer and 
hes happy with what I said in my provisional  decision. And hed like me to issue a final 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.  
Ref: DRN99516404Having done so, after taking carefully  into account  everything thats  been  said in response to 
my provisional decision, I dont consider  that Sunny has said anything  that affects my overall 
view.
In particular, I dont  think the gap in lending between loans 3 and 4 was long enough for 
Sunny reasonably to say that Mr H mightve  put his finances in order  during this period. And 
the fact that Sunny declined some  of the loan applications Mr H made doesnt mean that the 
loan applications  it approved were  sustainably affordable for Mr H.  
So I still think its fair and reasonable for me to uphold Mr Hs complaint from loan 8 
onwards, for the reasons I explained more  fully in my provisional decision.
putting things right - what  Sunny needs to do
 refund all interest  and charges that Mr H paid on loans 8 to 17
 
 add simple  interest  at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date they 
were paid to the date of settlement*
 
 the number of loans  taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  8 to 17 should be removed from Mr Hs credit file. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I partially uphold  this complaint and direct Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as 
Sunny) to pay Mr H as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 January 2020.
