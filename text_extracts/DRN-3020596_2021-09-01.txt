The complaint
Mr V complains that NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibly when it increased the credit limit of his 
credit cards.   
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. In my provisional decision I explained why I intended to uphold Mr Vs complaint. I 
said: 
In August 2012 NewDay approved an Aqua credit card for Mr V with a credit limit of £500. In
January 2013 the credit limit was increased to £750.
NewDay increased the Aqua credit limit several times between December 2013, when it was
increased to £1,500 and March 2016, when it reached £4,900. Each time, NewDay says the
credit limit increase was approved in line with its lending criteria.
In December 2015 Mr V applied for Marbles credit card with NewDay. In his application, Mr
V told NewDay he was a home owner, employed and earned around £40,000 and had
around £9,800 of unsecured debt. NewDay carried out a credit search and Mr K had around
£49,000 of defaulted credit as well as adverse credit entries recorded. The information
NewDay obtained showed the defaults and adverse credit were over 21 months old.
NewDay approved an initial credit limit of £450 and increased that to £1,050 in August 2016.
In January 2017 NewDay increased the Marbles credit limit to £1,650.
In December 2019 Mr V complained to NewDay that it had lent irresponsibly and failed to
carry out checks to ensure his credit card debt was affordable. NewDays final response
covered the Aqua and Marbles credit cards. NewDay didnt agree it had lent irresponsibly
and didnt uphold Mr Vs complaint.
Mr V referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They looked
at the Aqua credit card and upheld Mr Vs complaint. The investigator said we couldnt
consider the initial decision to approve the Aqua credit card or the first credit limit increase
because of the time limits set out in our rules. The investigator thought NewDay had lent
irresponsibly when it increased the credit limit on Mr Vs Aqua credit card from December
2013 onwards and asked it to refund all interest and charges applied. NewDay didnt accept
and asked to appeal.
In its response to the investigator, NewDay said it had considered Mr Vs credit file and
applied its lending criteria each time it had increased the credit limit. NewDay asked to
appeal, so Mr Vs complaint has been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As the investigator said, because of the time limits noted in our rules we can only look at
NewDays lending decisions from December 2013 onwards. Ive reached a different view to 
the investigator concerning how to resolve Mr Vs complaint. The investigators findings only 
looked at NewDays Aqua credit card. But as NewDays final response and the complaint file 
also includes information about Mr Vs Marbles credit card, Im going to include that in this 
provisional decision.
Before a business agrees to lend, it should take reasonable steps to ensure it does so in a
responsible way. Theres no set list of checks a lender has to complete. In practice, this
means businesses should ensure proportionate checks are carried out to make sure the
customer can afford to repay the borrowing in a sustainable way. These checks should take
into account various factors, like the amount being lent, the costs to the borrower each
month, credit history and the consumers income and outgoings. As the relationship between
lender and borrower progresses, the business may need to consider carrying out more
comprehensive checks to ensure the borrower can afford repayments in a sustainable way.
I agree with the investigator that NewDay failed to carry out proportionate checks and that it
lent irresponsibly. I think the information available to NewDay was sufficient to show Mr Vs
borrowing wasnt sustainable and shouldve led it to carry out further checks before
increasing his credit limit. In addition, I think the information available when Mr V applied for
his Marbles credit card and when NewDay subsequently increased its credit limit shouldve
caused it to carry out more comprehensive checks that wouldve shown another credit card
wasnt reasonable in his circumstances.
Looking at the first credit limit increase in December 2013, I can see NewDay doubled Mr
Vs credit limit from £750 to £1,500. I note that in the eight months before the credit limit
increase was put in pace Mr V had gone over his credit limit six times and been charged. I
can also see that late fees were applied. Whilst I note NewDay says it allows some over limit
and late payment fees, I think these issues shouldve caused it to ask more questions. Mr V
has recently told us he has had difficulties with debt that were particularly bad from 2011. I
can see Mr Vs credit file data shows he later had over £100,000 of unsecured debts. If
NewDay had carried out proportionate checks, like asking for a full copy of Mr Vs credit file,
requesting bank statements or evidence of his income, I think it wouldve found Mr V was
caught in a cycle of borrowing and declined to proceed.
It follows that if I think NewDay lent irresponsibly when it increased Mr Vs credit limit in
December 2013, subsequent increases were also approved without proportionate checks.
But Ive also looked at the information available to NewDay to see whether there were other
signs that shouldve caused it to carry out further checks.
In November 2014 NewDay increased the Aqua limit to £2,250. I can see that in September
2014 a financial difficulty marker was recorded on the credit file data provided. Another
financial difficulty marker was recorded in January 2014 (the month after NewDay increased
the credit limit to £1,500. Whilst I can see there was no reported marker in October 2014, I
think having two markers of this nature recorded within ten months shouldve caused
NewDay to consider asking more questions and look more closely at whether Mr V was able 
to sustainably manage the increased debt level. And, for broadly the same reasons Ive
given above, had it done that NewDay would likely have found Mr V wasnt able to
sustainably maintain repayments.
In April 2015 NewDay increased Mr Vs credit limit to £3,000. In the five months since the
credit limit had previously been increased Mr V incurred four over limit fees and took cash
advances of £490. Given there was a short track record for the account when the credit limitwas £2,250 and the majority of those months saw Mr Vs debt exceeding the credit limit, I
think there were signs NewDay couldve picked up on that showed he was having difficulties.
Again, had NewDay carried out more comprehensive checks I think it wouldve found Mr V
was unable to sustainably manage his Aqua credit card.
After five months at £3,000, the Aqua credit limit was again increased by £750 to £3,750. I
can see that two months before the increase Mr V exceeded the credit limit. And in four of
the preceding five months Mr V took cash advances totalling the entire £750 credit limit
increase. Whilst NewDay correctly says cash advances form part of the credit cards it offers,
they can often indicate a consumer is struggling. I think there were sufficient information to
show Mr V was likely struggling. And the information available to NewDay, along with the
pace at which it had increased Mr Vs credit limit, shouldve caused it to carry out more
comprehensive checks.
Mr V applied for a new credit card in December 2015 and provided information about his
circumstances. NewDay found five defaults totalling over £49,000 and public records (which
includes CCJs) of over £31,000. NewDay says those records were over 21 months old when
Mr V applied for his Marbles credit card and that it allows for some adverse credit. But I think
the fact NewDay had increased the Aqua card by £750 only three months before and Mr V
had already increased his balance to use up most of that, I think there were signs he was
experiencing some financial difficulties. And I think that shouldve caused NewDay to look
more closely at Mr Vs circumstances and carry out some additional checks.
Had NewDay carried out further checks, I think it wouldve found Mr Vs unsecured debt level
was considerably higher than declared in the application and that he wasnt able to
affordably maintain a new credit card. In addition to increasing Mr Vs credit limit on his Aqua
account, I think NewDay lent irresponsibly by approving the Marbles credit card.
The final £1,150 Aqua credit limit increase took it to £4,900 in March 2016, three months
after the Marbles application was approved. Marbles credit limit increases took place in
August 2016 and January 2017, taking it up to £1,650. The Marbles accounts credit limit
went from £450 to £1,650 in 13 months. Looking at the credit file information NewDay had
available, Im satisfied there were various signs Mr V was in a difficult financial position. I
note the number of payday loans increased, arrears became apparent and a total
outstanding credit card balance of over £100,000 were all recorded amongst other
information during this time. I think NewDay shouldve completed a more comprehensive
assessment of Mr Vs ability to maintain his payments. Had it done so, I dont think NewDay
wouldve proceeded.  
I invited both parties to respond with any additional comment or information they wanted me 
to consider before I made my final decision. Mr V responded to confirm he accepted the 
outcome. NewDay responded and said it didnt. 
In brief, NewDay said It had followed its lending criteria when approving the credit cards and 
limit increases. It says its lending criteria was in line with the rules and regulations. NewDay 
says it took affordability data and information from Mr Vs credit file into account each time 
before agreeing to lend. NewDay didnt agree it had lent irresponsibly and didnt agree to 
settle in line with my provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and whyIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to thank NewDay for the detailed response provided. Ive considered all the 
information provided and points made. My findings will focus on the points I feel are most 
relevant to the outcome in this case. And I think its reasonable to note that much of the 
information NewDay has provided was set out in its original submission. 
I understand the credit cards and limit increases were approved in line with NewDays 
lending criteria. But, as Ive set out above, I think there were signs that Mr V was struggling 
financially for a significant period that shouldve caused NewDay to consider whether relying 
on its standard checks was a reasonable approach. 
NewDays response says it wont approve a credit limit increase if a card hold has been 
incurred for three consecutive months and that Mr V hadnt experienced arrears of that 
nature. I appreciate that may be the case, but I can see Mr V went over his credit limit six 
times in the eight months prior to the increase in December 2013. In addition, Mr V made a 
late payment in the preceding months. I appreciate the case handlers claim this was most 
likely an oversight, but I dont agree the information supports that view. I remain of the 
opinion that there was sufficient information available to NewDay that shouldve caused it to 
carry out more comprehensive checks. And I still think that, had NewDay carried out better 
checks, it wouldnt have increased Mr Vs borrowing, in line with the findings in my 
provisional decision. 
NewDays response says it can only make lending decisions based on the information it had 
to hand at the time. For the reasons set out in my provisional decision, I dont agree the 
information NewDay had was sufficient to ensure it lent responsibly. I remain of the view that 
NewDay shouldve carried out more proportionate and comprehensive lending checks before 
agreeing to lend. Had it done so, I dont think NewDay wouldve proceeded.    
Putting things right
To resolve Mr Vs complaint, I direct NewDay to settle as follows: 
- Refund all interest and charges applied to the Aqua card from December 2013 
onwards against balances over £750
- Refund all interest and charges applied to the Marbles card from inception
- If at any period the interest refunds result in Mr Vs closed accounts being in credit, 
pay 8% simple annual interest on the date that credit balance arose to the date of 
settlement
- NewDay should amend Mr Vs credit file to remove all adverse information reported 
about both cards from December 2013 to date
- If the debts have been sold to a third party, NewDay may need to consider buying 
them back to ensure its able to settle Mr Vs complaint in line with this guidance 
 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Vs complaint and direct NewDay Ltd to settle in line with the 
above guidance.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or reject my decision before 29 September 2021.
