DRN-3569239
The complaint
Mrs D complains that a level term life assurance and critical illness cover policy sold to her 
by Bank of Scotland plc  trading as Halifax wont pay her a lump sum when it ends.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts arent in dispute so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
The limited documents available from the time this policy was sold dont show any 
reference being made to there being a pay-out at the end of its term.
The details instead show this was a type of insurance, which would only pay out if 
certain events happened. 
The policy is therefore working as the evidence shows Halifax always said it would. I 
cant see theyve made a mistake, or said the policy would work some other way.
While I appreciate Mrs D expected the policy to work a different way, I cant see 
thats been caused by Halifax. So I dont think itd be fair to have them change the 
policy to better meet Mrs Ds expectations. 
For these reasons, I dont uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs D to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 September 2022.
