The complaint
Mrs A complains that HSBC UK Bank plc wont refund to her the money that shes claimed 
relating to a driveway and other works. Shes being helped with her complaint by a 
representative.
What happened
Mrs A used her HSBC credit card in April 2016 to pay £8,625 to a supplier as part of the cost 
of a new driveway, path and steps that were to be laid at her then home. The total cost of the 
work was £11,500 and she paid the balance by two cheques.
She had some issues with the work so complained to the supplier and she then contacted 
trading standards. It said that, because she paid the supplier using her credit card, she could 
make a claim to HSBC under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. She made a 
claim to HSBC and it asked her to provide an independent report about the work. It paid her 
a total of £350 compensation because of some issues with its customer service. It then said 
that, because she had moved home and no longer lived at the property where the driveway 
was laid, she could no longer claim for it. 
Mrs A wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. She claimed a refund 
of the cost of the work, compensation for the time it had taken HSBC to deal with her 
complaint and for the stress and anxiety caused, and reimbursement for the cost of her 
representative.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He thought that 
there was a suggestion that there had been a breach of contract by the supplier but the 
property, including the driveway, had been sold and Mrs A hadnt been able to evidence a 
loss, so he concluded that he couldnt reasonably ask HSBC to take further action in relation 
to her complaint. 
Mrs As representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs As complaint about HSBC, I must be satisfied that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the driveway and 
other work and that HSBCs response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or 
reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mrs As claim under section 75 
as only a court would be able to do that;
the driveway was installed in 2016 and Mrs A made a section 75 claim to HSBC 
about the suppliers breach of contract in November 2019  the supplier has stopped 
trading and Mrs A sold the property at which the driveway had been installed in July 
2020 and moved to another property;
our investigator has described in detail the communications between Mrs A and 
HSBC  but, in summary, it asked her to provide an independent report about the 
issues with the driveway which she didnt do and it paid her a total of £350 for some 
customer service issues;
Mrs A sent e-mails to the supplier in June 2020 about her issues with the work but 
the supplier didnt respond to her;
Mrs As representative was able to provide HSBC in December 2020 with a summary 
from the author of a report about the driveway that had been prepared for trading 
standards which said:  the work was of a below average standard, with poor 
attention to detail, particularly at the edges. The owner at the time did not allow me to 
remove any of the surface to accurately measure the thickness of the application. 
There had been some reflective cracking previously reported, with repair work 
undertaken in some areas. In one area a significant amount of opaque resin is 
present at the surface, giving a wholly unacceptable appearance;
I consider it to be more likely than not that there has been a breach of contract by the 
supplier because the work wasnt of satisfactory quality, but I also consider that it 
was fair and reasonable for HSBC to require Mrs A to provide an independent report 
about the work  and she hasnt done so;
I would expect such a report to explain the faults with the work and to recommend 
the actions that were necessary to remedy those faults  and if there had been a 
breach contract I consider that the appropriate remedy would most likely have been 
for HSBC to arrange and pay for the work to be repaired  but Mrs A has sold the 
property at which the driveway was laid and I dont consider that it would now be 
appropriate for HSBC to be required to repair the driveway and other work;
Mrs As representative has calculated Mrs As loss based on the time that she had 
the benefit of the driveway as £9,019.61 and said that Mrs A would accept that 
amount from HSBC  but hes since proposed a settlement figure of 50% of the price 
that Mrs A paid to the supplier which equates to £5,750;
Im not persuaded that Mrs A or her representative has provided enough evidence to 
show that Mrs A has suffered a financial loss as a result of any breach of contract by 
the supplier and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to 
require HSBC to refund to Mrs A the settlement figure proposed by her 
representative;
HSBC has accepted that there have been some customer service issues in its 
dealings with Mrs A and it has paid her £350 compensation for those issues  but I 
dont consider that those issues have unfairly or unreasonably delayed its resolution 
of her claim or that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to pay her more 
compensation than it has already paid to her for those customer service issues;
other than those customer service issues, I consider that HSBCs response to 
Mrs As claim has been fair and reasonable in the circumstances but she hasnt 
provided it with an independent report about the faults with the work and she has 
sold that property; andI sympathise with Mrs A for the issues that shes had with the driveway and other 
works, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me 
to require HSBC to refund to Mrs A any of the money that she paid to the supplier, to 
reimburse her for the cost of her representative, to pay her any other compensation 
or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2021.
