The complaint
Mr L says Provident Personal Credit Limited trading as Satsuma, irresponsibly lent to him. 
He says if Satsuma had made better checks it would have seen that he already had 
problems managing him money before Satsuma lent to him. He thinks it shouldnt have 
approved this lending. 
What happened
This complaint is about some instalment loans Satsuma provided to Mr L between July 2014 
and August 2018. Ive put some information about all of the lending applications Mr L made 
in the table below. But just to emphasise only applications 1, 5 and 9 were fully proceeded 
with by both parties. The other loans were either cancelled, not taken, up or were declined.

Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. He thought the checks the business did for the 
earlier loans were proportionate. And he hadnt seen anything in the later loans which 
wouldve led to the business not approving them. 
Mr L disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. He reiterated that he had bad credit when he 
started the loans so Satsuma shouldnt have approved them. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending  including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that Satsuma needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt 
lend irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out proportionate checks to 
make sure Mr L could repay his loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, there may come 
a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that the 
lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same reasons.
Looking at the lending above Mr L borrowed, and made regular repayments to, three loans 
from Satsuma. This was application 1 in 2014, application 5 in 2016 and application 9 in 
2018. So, there were large breaks in between the times he was actually making repayments 
to Satsuma. 
I can see that in between these loans Mr L did apply for other lending and he either didnt 
proceed with the applications or they were declined by Satsuma. But I dont think this means 
that Satsuma shouldnt have lent. It looks to me like both Mr L and the business were 
making decisions about when it was reasonable to borrow and lend. And not entering it a 
lending relationship when it wasnt appropriate to do so. 
Turning to the loans that Mr L did take. Ive seen a record of the information Satsuma 
provided when he completed his loan applications. Satsuma recorded that he had a monthly 
income of £1,350 for loans 1 and 9 and £1,170 for loan 5. His monthly expenditure was 
recorded as being £500 for loan 1 and around £850 for loans 5 and 9. His expenditure was a 
mixture of the information Mr L declared and information taken from a credit reference 
agency about his financial outgoings. But looking at these amounts it would have been 
reasonable for Satsuma to think that the loans were affordable for Mr L. 
I havent seen any further information that shows its likely Satsuma was made aware of any 
financial problems Satsuma mightve been having. Or anything that wouldve prompted it to 
investigate Mr Ls circumstances further. 
Mr L has said that he was in financial difficulty when he took all of this lending. And the fact 
that Satsuma declined loans at times does tend to support this. But it also makes it 
reasonable to say that Satsuma did recognise when Mr Ls financial problems meant it 
shouldnt have lent. 
And even if I think that Satsuma should have made better checks then I dont have enough 
information to say the loans shouldnt have been approved to Mr L. He hasnt provided any 
further detail about what his financial problems were. 
So, I think it was reasonable for Satsuma to rely on the information it obtained. I also think 
the assessments Satsuma did for these loans were proportionate. And I think its decisions to 
lend were reasonable. Im not upholding Mr Ls complaint about them. 
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 April 2021.
