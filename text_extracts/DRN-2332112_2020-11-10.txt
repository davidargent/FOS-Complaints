The complaint
Miss S complains that she has paid too much for mileage when her agreement with 
Santander Consumer (UK) plc ended following rejection of the car.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision explaining why I was proposing to uphold this complaint and 
ask Santander to refund £158.52.
In summary, I concluded that Santander could make a deduction from the monthly payments 
Miss S had made to reflect her usage of the car. 
I concluded that the usage charges totalled £2689.75 (7685 miles at 35p) and that at the 
time the car was rejected Miss S had made payments of £2158.52, leaving a balance of 
£531.23 to pay. Miss S had in fact paid £689.75 so a refund of £158.52 was due.
I invited Miss S and Santander to let me have any further evidence or arguments they 
wanted to make before I finally determined the matter.
Miss S asked for an explanation of how I had reached my provisional decision. 
Santander didnt respond to my provisional decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that the investigator has explained my calculations to Miss S. 
 havent seen any evidence to give me any reason to reach different conclusions to the ones 
I set out in my provisional decision. 
Putting things right
Based on what Ive seen, Miss S paid £689.75 for the balance of usage which was too 
much.  She should receive a refund of £158.52.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint. Santander Consumer (UK) plc must refund 
£158.52 to Miss S.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 December 2020.
