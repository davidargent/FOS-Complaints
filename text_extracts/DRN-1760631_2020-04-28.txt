The complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc closed his account.
What happened
Mr M had a current account with NatWest.
On 13 June 2019, NatWest decided to close Mr Ms account and gave him 14 days notice to 
make alternative banking arrangements. NatWest wrote to Mr M on 14 June 2019 to let him 
know his account was closing.
Mr M says he hasnt done anything wrong and as a result of NatWest actions hes having 
trouble opening another bank account He says NatWest didnt let him know it was closing 
his account on 14 June 2019 and he didnt get a letter from the bank until 20 June 2019. 
Hes also upset that NatWest havent given him an explanation about why it no longer 
wanted him as a customer. 
NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong when it decided to close Mr Ms account. And 
had acted in accordance with the terms and conditions. Mr M wasnt happy with this 
response. So, he brought his complaint to us.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ms complaint. She said NatWest hadnt done 
anything wrong when it closed Mr Ms account. Mr M disagreed. He said he has been a 
customer of the bank for a number of years and hes been treated unfairly.
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear from what Mr M has told us and the bank that he feels strongly about his complaint. 
I appreciate that hes upset that NatWest closed his account and that this caused him 
inconvenience. But for me to uphold this complaint, I must be satisfied that the bank has 
done something wrong. And in this case, I dont think it has. Ill explain why. 
As the investigator has already explained, its generally for banks to decide whether or not 
they want to provide, or to continue to provide banking services to a particular customer. I 
know Mr M feels NatWest has treated him unfairly when it closed his account and hes 
struggled to open another account since. But unless theres a good reason to do so, this 
service wont usually say a bank must keep a customer.
Banks should however give a customer reasonable notice about its intention to close an 
account. Looking at the terms and conditions of Mr Ms account, NatWest could close the 
account by giving him 60 days notice. But it can be less. And under certain circumstances 
NatWest can close an account immediately.Mr M has said NatWest didnt give him a proper explanation why it closed his account. But 
NatWest werent obliged to tell Mr M why it no longer wanted him as a customer  as much 
as hed like to know. And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it do so.
Mr M says NatWest didnt let him know it was closing his account until 20 June 2019 when 
he received a letter from the bank, which he says was nearly a week after the banks letter 
was dated. Ive seen a screen shot from the bank which shows a letter was sent to Mr Ms 
address on 14 June 2019, and that his account was closed on 1 July 2019. I havent seen 
any evidence that Mr M was experiencing postal problems at the time, which might have 
explained why the letter didnt arrive until 20 June 2019. And I cant hold NatWest 
responsible for the postal system. But Im satisfied that the letter was received by Mr M as 
he took it with him when he visited a branch to collect his balance. And that NatWest gave 
Mr M notice it was closing his account.  
Having looked at the circumstances of this complaint and the information NatWest relied on 
to close Mr Ms account, Im satisfied that NatWest were entitled to close his account. It gave 
Mr M adequate time to open an alternative account. So, whilst I accept this caused Mr M 
inconvenience, I cant say NatWest has treated him unfairly when it closed his account.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2020.
