K821x#15complaint
Mr G says CashEuroNet UK LLC trading as QuickQuid irresponsibly  lent to him. He says 
that QuickQuid didnt make adequate affordability checks  before lending. He says that if it 
had done it wouldve seen he couldnt afford to make the loan repayments. 
background
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be partially upheld. QuickQuid disagreed with 
the adjudicators  opinion.  The complaint was then passed to me. 
I issued my provisional decision saying that Mr Gs complaint should  be upheld  in part. A 
copy of the background to the complaint  and my provisional findings, is attached and form 
part of this final decision. 
QuickQuid, and Mr G, confirmed  that they had received my provisional decision. 
QuickQuid, didnt agree with my provisional  decision. It said that:
the checks it provided were sufficient  and were within  the regulatory guidelines. They 
didnt show that Mr G would struggle to repay  his loans
it doesnt agree that repeated borrowing was a sign that Mr G couldnt  sustainably 
repay his loans, he had some longer  breaks  between some of his loans 
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In my provisional decision I considered the checks that QuickQuid made before lending. I 
thought, for some  of the loans, they hadnt gone  far enough and I explained why. I 
appreciate that QuickQuid  doesnt  agree but it hasnt added  anything further for me to 
consider about  why this is. So my decision on this issue remains  the same as before and for 
the same  reasons. 
I accept that Mr G did have some significant breaks in lending.  But again  I did think  about 
this in my provisional decision and I said why it didnt  make a great deal of difference  to 
which loans I thought should  be upheld.  My decision about this also remains the same  as 
before and for the same  reasons. 
I thought some of Mr Gs loans should be upheld because QuickQuid repeatedly approved 
loans over a long period of time. QuickQuid should  be aware of our established approach to 
this type of lending from the information on our website  and other  decisions it has received. 
I still think this it was wrong to lend in this way here. QuickQuid approved loans  to Mr G for 
over four years. I think Mr Gs need to take high cost short term loans on such a long term 
basis is an indication of financial problems. These problems were  likely caused by the re-
borrowing itself. I dont  think it indicates that he was on a good financial footing and able to 
repay the loans  sustainably.  
So my decision about Mr Gs complaint remains the same as in my provisional decision and 
for the same reasons.  
Ref: DRN48926262putting things right  what I think  QuickQuid needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 3 to 23;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 3 and 4 and loans 11 to 17 from Mr Gs 
credit file;
the number  of loans taken over loans 5 to 10 and 18 to 23 onwards means  any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 5 to 10 and 18 
to 23 should be removed from Mr Gs credit file.
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Gs complaint.
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 August 2019.

Ref: DRN48926263extract from my provisional  decision
This complaint is about  22 payday  loans  and one running  credit account  QuickQuid provided to Mr G 
between July 2011 and October 2015. A summary  of Mr Gs lending history is shown at the end of 
this decision. 
QuickQuid didnt think  that the Financial Ombudsman Service should look at loans 1 and 2 as the 
complaint was made too late. After  some  correspondence Mr G has withdrawn his complaint about 
these loans.
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Gs complaint. He thought that loans 3, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20 and 
21 shouldnt have been given. 
QuickQuid disagreed with what the adjudicator said. But it also said that in order to amicably resolve 
the complaint it would  offer to pay compensation on loan 3, loans 10 to 12, loans 14 to 15 and loan 
17. 
Mr G didnt accept Quick Quids offer and the complaint was passed to me, an ombudsman.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to provisionally decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints 
about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry  practice - on 
our website. 
QuickQuid needed to take reasonable  steps  to ensure  that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mr G could repay  the loans  
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish whether  
Mr G could sustainably repay his loans   not just whether  the loan payments were  affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN48926264Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable as being  without undue  
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time,  while meeting  
other reasonable  commitments; as well as without  having  to borrow to meet  the repayments. And it 
follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower wont 
be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments 
without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.
Mr G borrowed from QuickQuid over a long period that is over four years.  There  was usually very little 
break between the loans. But I can see there was a period of just less than six months between loans 
7 and 8, and just over seven months between loans 10 and 11, when Mr G wasnt borrowing from 
QuickQuid.  
But, when Mr G applied for loan 8 it was over a year and a half after loan 1. So I dont think it was 
reasonable for QuickQuid  to say that there was a significant break in the lending  before loan 8. But 
the break before  loan 11 was longer and it wasnt much after the break between loans 7 and 8. So I 
think it wouldve been reasonable for QuickQuid to treat Mr G as a new customer  before approving 
loan 11.  
So, overall,  I think all of loans  1 to 10 and 11 to 23 should be considered as two separate chains of 
continuous borrowing. So I think less checks would  be proportionate at the start of both of these  
periods of lending.   
why I dont think QuickQuids checks were proportionate for loans  3 and 4 and loans 11 to 17
For loan 3 Mr G needed  to repay  around £400 the month after taking it. And he needed to repay  
around £250  for loan 4. So Mr G was, at times, borrowing and repaying  reasonably significant 
amounts compared with his declared  income  of £2,500. And these were  his third and fourth loans in a 
reasonably short period of time. 
Similarly over loans 11 to 17 Mr G borrowed  higher  amounts, for example he needed to repay just 
under £1,000  for loan 12 after he increased  it. And he borrowed these loans in reasonably quick 
succession. 
So I think at both of these times QuickQuid couldve realised that Mr G may have some longer term 
financial problems rather than just using the loans  to help with a temporary cash flow problem. 
QuickQuid shouldve  also become concerned about whether it knew enough  about  Mr Gs true 
financial situation.
I think  that it wouldve  been  proportionate to find out about Mr Gs normal monthly living  costs and 
regular financial commitments before  approving loans 3 and 11. Before  approving loans 4 and 12 it 
should also have found out about any other short  term lending Mr G mayve had. And before 
approving loans 13 to 17 it shouldve made a full review of his finances. This was to make  sure Mr G 
was in position to make  the repayments sustainably.
I dont think QuickQuid  did this. As far as I can see it looked at Mr Gs income  and some credit 
reference agency data before approving  these loans.  So I need to think about what QuickQuid 
wouldve seen if it had carried out proportionate checks. 
Ref: DRN48926265what I think proportionate checks would most likely  have  shown
Mr G has provided some information about his financial  circumstances. This includes  his bank 
statements. I accept that this isnt exactly what QuickQuid wouldve seen at the time.  But I think  it 
wouldve found out similar information if it had made proportionate checks, so I think its reasonable to 
rely on it.
This shows that Mr G was having problems managing his money  over the time he took loans 3 and 4 
and loans 11 to 17. I can see that, as our adjudicator outlined, his general expenditure  was either  very 
close to or above his income. I can also see that he was making significant repayments to other 
creditors which included a debt management company. He was also borrowing, at times,  from friends 
and family to make ends meet. 
I think  that QuickQuid  wouldve found out this information if it had made  proportionate checks. And I 
think it wouldve seen  Mr G wouldnt  have been able repay the loans in a sustainable way. So I think 
that QuickQuid  shouldnt have given them to Mr G and I think hes lost out as a result of this.
So Im upholding Mr Gs complaint about loans  3 and 4 and loans  11 to 17. 
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of QuickQuids lending history with Mr G, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point in each loan chain  at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 5 in the 
first chain of lending  and loan 18 in the second. I say this because:
For loans 5 to 10 and 18 to 23 Mr G was usually  provided with new loans within  a few weeks 
of settling the previous ones.  And hed been doing this for some  time before taking these 
loans. So QuickQuid ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr G was having to 
borrow further  to cover  the hole repaying his previous loans was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Gs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr G wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid over these  loans. 
Loan 23 was taken out 4 years after loan 1. And the amounts Mr G was borrowing had 
increased significantly.  QuickQuids records showed that Mr G borrowed for 4.36 years 
overall. He borrowed  £7,910  and repaid £2,573.71 in interest.
So Mr G had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to QuickQuid over an 
extended period.
I think  that Mr G lost out because QuickQuid continued  to provide borrowing from loan four onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number of loans  and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications on 
Mr Gs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  for these  high-cost 
loans.
So Im also upholding the complaint about loans  5 to 10 and 18 to 23 and QuickQuid should  put 
things right.
