K820x#14complaint
Miss G says Bank of Scotland  plc (BOS) mis-sold  her an Ultimate Reward Current  Account 
(URCA) packaged bank  account on two occasions.  Shes  used a Claims Management 
Company (CMC) to make her complaint.
background
One of our adjudicators looked  at Miss Gs complaint and didnt think  that BOS had mis-sold 
the URCA to Miss G. The CMC  disagreed  and asked  for an ombudsmans  decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Miss Gs complaint.  
Having looked  through everything provided and thought about what both parties have said, I 
think that Miss G chose to take the URCA  knowing  she didnt have to have it as she 
switched to and from it. She used  some of the benefits  such as the mobile phone  
insurance (and the Â£150 mortgage cashback)  - and was eligible for and couldve  used  others 
too. 
And while Im open to the possibility Miss G wasnt told everything she needed to know 
about all of the benefits, I havent seen anything in her circumstances to suggest  that she 
wouldve been affected by any of the main limitations or exclusions. So I dont  think  clearer 
information about either the monthly  cost or the URCAs benefits wouldve changed Miss Gs 
decision and she received enough  to know and understand what  it was she was agreeing  to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Miss Gs complaint.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 June 2019.
