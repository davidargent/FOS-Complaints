The complaint
Mr D says Evergreen Finance London Ltd  trading as MoneyBoat (MoneyBoat) - 
irresponsibly lent to him.                          
Background
This complaint is about two instalment loans MoneyBoat provided to Mr D between August 
and September 2018.  Mr Ds borrowing history is as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Repayment
1 06/08/2018 21/09/2018 6 £800.00 £230.85
2 25/09/2018 Outstanding 6 £1,300.00 £401.87
 
At the time of writing this decision, loan 2 was outstanding. 
In the most recent assessment, our adjudicator upheld Mr Ds complaint and thought both 
loans shouldnt have been given because the information MoneyBoat had gathered about Mr 
D showed he was having problems managing his money because he had other outstanding 
debts when he was given the first loan. 
MoneyBoat disagreed and said it couldnt be expected to read every line of the credit file for 
applications it received. MoneyBoat requested an ombudsmans review of the complaint and 
it was passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure  Mr D 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider several 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MoneyBoat was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint. Having done this, Im upholding Mr Ds 
complaint from loan 1. Ill explain why.
I think MoneyBoat ought to have realised that Mr D wouldnt have been able to make his 
repayments for his loan sustainably without taking out more lending. I can see MoneyBoat 
did credit checks on Mr D before it lent the first loan to him. And I can see that MoneyBoat 
has provided the reports from the credit checks to us. 
Having reviewed all of this, I dont think Mr D was able to repay any of his loans in a 
sustainable manner.  Whilst it is not expected that MoneyBoat review each line of the report, 
the credit check reports show that Mr D had a considerable amount of debt at the time and 
had taken a significant amount of credit facilities in the six months prior to lending loan 1, 
which included short-term loans. This information was apparent both times MoneyBoat did a 
credit check. So, MoneyBoat was aware from the information it has provided, that it was 
likely Mr D would be unable to sustainable repay not just loan 1 but all the loans. 
I think this was a clear indication that Mr D was in a debt cycle and relying upon further 
borrowing to repay his then borrowing. So, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 1 
and 2 and MoneyBoat should put things right.
Putting things right  what MoneyBoat needs to do
If MoneyBoat has sold the outstanding debts MoneyBoat should buy these back if 
MoneyBoat is able to do so and then take the following steps. If MoneyBoat cant buy the 
debts back, then MoneyBoat should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results 
outlined below.A) MoneyBoat should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr D towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including 
anything MoneyBoat has already refunded.
B) MoneyBoat should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Mr D which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr D originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) MoneyBoat should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr D as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mr D having made 
overpayments then MoneyBoat should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
date the complaint is settled. MoneyBoat should then refund the amounts calculated in A 
and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus, 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr D. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then MoneyBoat should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr D. MoneyBoat 
shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal MoneyBoat has already written-
off.
E) MoneyBoat should remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Ds credit file in 
relation to loans 1 and 2. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Ds complaint. Evergreen Finance London 
Ltd should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2020.
