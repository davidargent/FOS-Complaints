K821x#15complaint
Mr S complains that a hire purchase  agreement, under which a car was supplied  to him, was 
mis-sold to him by Cotswold Motor Group Limited. His wife is also involved with his 
complaint.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr Ss car had been damaged in an incident and hed received some money from his 
insurers so he went to Cotswold Motor Group  in November  2018 to use that money 
as a deposit for a replacement car  but he says that he was still suffering from 
injuries caused in the incident;
he agreed that a nearly new car would be supplied to him under a hire purchase  
agreement with a credit provider that he signed in December 2018;
before  signing  the agreement  he went to Cotswold  Motor Group again, with his wife 
who was concerned about the affordability  of the agreement,  and she says that the 
salesman assured  them that Mr S could withdraw from the agreement within the first 
14 days without any cost to him;
Mr S returned the car to the dealer six days later because he was concerned that it 
was unaffordable so he wanted to withdraw from the agreement and he says that he 
was told that he could withdraw from the agreement but he would need to pay the 
outstanding amount  of the price  of the car;
Cotswold Motor  Group then agreed to buy the car back for £37,500  and to settle  the 
agreement  and with other payments  the cost to Mr S was reduced  to £3,312;
Mr S then complained  to Cotswold Motor Group and this service that the agreement 
had been mis-sold  to him;
our investigator thought that the salesman had failed  to disclose to Mr S information 
about ending the agreement and she didnt think that Mr S would have entered into 
the agreement  if hed been  given  the proper information about his right to withdraw 
from it  so she recommended that Cotswold Motor Group should refund the loss of 
£3,312 to Mr S;
I sympathise with Mr S for the issues that hes described and the difficulties that hes 
experienced  his complaint about the affordability of the agreement  is being dealt 
with separately in a complaint made against  the credit provider so I havent 
considered the issues relating to that in this decision;
this is a finely balanced complaint but having considered all of the evidence I 
consider it to be more  likely than not that the salesman didnt properly  explain  to Mr S 
his right to withdraw from the agreement and that, if hed done  so, its more likely  
than not that Mr S wouldnt have signed  the agreement;
Ref: DRN03725002I consider that Cotswold Motor Group  has tried to help Mr S by buying the car back 
from him but that has left him paying £3,312 for six days use of the car  and I dont 
consider that to be fair and reasonable;  and
I find that it would be fair and reasonable in these circumstances for Cotswold Motor 
Group to refund  to Mr S the £3,312 that hes claimed  but I dont consider that it 
would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to take any other action in response to 
his complaint.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold Mr Ss complaint and I order  Cotswold Motor  Group  Limited to 
pay £3,312 to him.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 February  2020.
