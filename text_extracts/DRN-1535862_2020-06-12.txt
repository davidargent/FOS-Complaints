DRN-1535862Each of the loans was due to be repaid in six monthly instalments, but Miss H repaid some 
of them much earlier than originally planned. At times Miss H had several loans outstanding 
at the same time. Miss H repaid the first 17 loans in full, but she fell behind with her 
payments on the final three loans, and balances remained outstanding on the final three 
loans when Miss H made her complaint.
When Miss H complained to Sunny, it offered to write off the outstanding balances on the 
last three loans, and to remove those loans from Miss Hs credit file. Miss H didnt accept the 
offer, and brought her complaint to us.
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should be upheld in part. In summary, she didnt think 
Sunny had been wrong to make the first four loans. But she thought that proportionate 
checks would have shown that Miss H was having problems managing her money by the 
time she took out loan 5. And she thought that by the time Miss H took out loan 8, Sunny 
should have realised that Miss Hs pattern of borrowing itself suggested that shed become 
dependent on short-term loans. So the adjudicator said Sunny should pay Miss H some 
compensation, and make some amendments to her credit file.
After the adjudicator sent out her view, Sunny offered to do as the adjudicator had said, but 
only for loans 18-20. Miss H wasnt happy with Sunnys offer, so the complaints been 
passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Miss H 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,
unsustainable).There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that its important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss H could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to 
realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely 
to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Hs complaint.
Sunny did some checks before it lent to Miss H. It asked her for details of her income, and 
her normal expenditure. And it checked her credit file before agreeing the loans. Ive seen a 
summary of those checks and I dont think they showed anything that should have caused 
additional concerns to Sunny.
As I mentioned earlier, each of Miss Hs loans was repayable over a six-month period. So 
the amounts that Miss H needed to repay each time were smaller than if shed taken a 
normal payday loan. But of course she was committing to making those repayments over a 
much longer period. And at times Miss H had a number of loans outstanding together. So 
Ive needed to consider the total amount that Miss H needed to repay to Sunny each month.
I think that the checks Sunny did before agreeing the first four loans were proportionate. The 
amounts that Miss H needed to repay were small compared with the income shed declared. 
Given these repayment amounts, what was apparent about Miss Hs circumstances at the 
time, and her borrowing history with the lender, I dont think it would have been proportionate 
for Sunny to ask her for the amount of information that would be needed to show the lending 
was unsustainable before agreeing the first four loans. So I dont think Sunny was wrong to 
give those loans to Miss H. 
But loan 5 was the fifth loan Miss H had asked Sunny for in less than three months. And 
although shed repaid loans 1 and 2 ahead of schedule, shed quickly applied to borrow 
again. And loan 4 was still outstanding when Miss H applied for loan 5. So I think that it 
ought to have occurred to Sunny that Miss Hs true financial position might not be as healthy 
as the monthly income and expenditure figures shed provided suggested. And I think that 
Sunny should, at this stage, have taken steps to verify Miss Hs true financial position before 
agreeing further loans.
Ive looked at Miss Hs bank statements and credit file from the time to see what its likely 
that proper checks would have shown Sunny. And I think that if Sunny had looked into Miss 
Hs financial position as closely as I think it should have done, it would have become aware 
that Miss H was borrowing from a variety of short-term lenders. In addition to the loan she 
already had with Sunny (loan 4), she had loans outstanding with at least two other short-
term lenders when she applied for loan 5. So I think it should have been apparent to Sunny 
that it was likely that Miss H was having significant problems managing her finances. And my 
view is the same regarding loans 6 and 7, for similar reasons.Looking at the overall pattern of Miss Hs borrowing from Sunny, I think that by the time she 
applied for loan 8, Sunny should have realised that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. So Sunny should have realised, at this point, that it shouldnt provide any 
further loans to Miss H.
Loan 8 was Miss Hs eighth loan request in just under seven months. And in that time, 
thered only been a week when she didnt have any loans outstanding with Sunny. Whats 
more, she wasnt making any significant inroads into her borrowing from Sunny. Its true that 
shed paid some of her loans off earlier than planned. But shed borrowed again very quickly. 
And I think that that pattern of frequent borrowing and repaying early should, itself, have 
contributed to the conclusion that Miss H might be having problems managing her money. 
Following loan 8, Miss H continued to borrow repeatedly, and frequently from Sunny, with 
multiple loans overlapping at some points. And I think this ought to have led Sunny to realise 
that it was more likely than not that Miss H was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying her previous loans was leaving in her finances, and that her borrowing wasnt 
sustainable.
I think that Miss H lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 8 
onwards because these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss H's indebtedness by 
allowing her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time. The sheer number of loans, and the period she was borrowing over, was likely to have 
had negative implications for Miss Hs ability to access mainstream credit, and so kept her in 
the market for these high-cost loans. 
So taking everything into account, I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Miss H 
from loan 5 onwards. This means Sunny needs to pay Miss H some compensation.
Putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to make loans 5 onwards to Miss H. So Sunny 
should:
refund all the interest and charges that Miss H paid on loans 5 to 17 inclusive;
pay interest at 8% simple per year on each of those amounts from the dates when
Miss H paid them to the date of settlement;
remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loans 18-20 and treat all
payments Miss H made towards those loans as payments towards the capital;
if reworking Miss Hs loan accounts as Ive directed results in Miss H effectively
having made payments above the original capital borrowed, then Sunny should
refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments,
from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of settlement;if reworking Miss Hs loan accounts leaves an amount of capital still to be paid, then
Sunny can use the total refund for loans 5 to 17 (after the deduction of tax) to offset
this;
remove any negative information recorded on Miss Hs credit file in relation to loans 5
to 7 inclusive;
the number of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information recorded
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 8 to 20 should be removed from
Miss Hs credit file when those loans have been repaid.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must 
give Miss H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I require Elevate Credit International 
Limited (trading as Sunny) to put things right by doing as Ive set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss H to accept 
or reject my decision before 10 July 2020.
