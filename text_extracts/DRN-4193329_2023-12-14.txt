The complaint
Miss A complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) is refusing to refund her the 
amount she lost as the result of a scam.
What happened
The background of this complaint is well known to all parties, so I wont repeat what 
happened in detail.
In summary, Miss A was in contact with an individual (X) through a marriage website. After 
beginning to talk to X Miss A swapped contact information with them and started to talk via a 
popular messaging application.
After a short time, the conversation turned to investment and X explained Miss A could make 
money by investing. X explained that he worked with investments and could help Miss A pay 
off her mortgage. X was very persuasive and had similar religious beliefs to Miss A with she 
says made her trust him more.
X talked Miss A through the process of setting up a cryptocurrency account with Coinbase 
which Miss A had access to throughout the time she was investing. Miss A was then 
instructed to send funds from her Coinbase account to a trading website he had sent her the 
details of. 
Miss A made the following transfers into the scam via her Coinbase and Binance accounts. I 
understand other payments were also made into the scam that RBS is investigating:

Miss A financed the investments via her own savings and by taking out several loans. Miss A 
tells us that X coached her through what reasons to give for each loan and what to say to 
RBS if payments she attempted to make were stopped.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It has not been disputed that Miss A has fallen victim to a cruel scam. The evidence provided 
by both Miss A and RBS sets out what happened. What is in dispute is whether RBS should 
refund the money Miss A lost due to the scam.
Recovering the payments Miss A made
When payments are made by card the only recovery option RBS has is to request a 
chargeback.
The chargeback scheme is a voluntary scheme set up to resolve card payment disputes
between merchants and cardholders. The card scheme operator ultimately helps settle 
disputes that cant be resolved between the merchant and the cardholder.
Such arbitration is subject to the rules of the scheme, meaning there are only limited
grounds and limited forms of evidence that will be accepted for a chargeback to be
considered valid, and potentially succeed. Time limits also apply.
Miss A was dealing with X, which was the person that instigated the scam. But Miss A didnt 
make the payments to X directly, she paid separate cryptocurrency exchanges. This is 
important because RBS would only have been able to process chargeback claims against 
the merchants she paid, not another party.
The service provided by the crypto exchanges would have been to convert or facilitate 
conversion of Miss As payments into cryptocurrency. Therefore, they provided the service 
that was requested; that being the purchase of the cryptocurrency.
The fact that the cryptocurrency was later transferred elsewhere  to the scammer  doesnt
give rise to a valid chargeback claim against the merchants Miss A paid.
When a payment is made by transfer RBS has limited options available to it for recovery of 
the funds.I have also considered whether Miss A should receive a refund for the payments she made 
into the scam under the Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM) Code.
The CRM code doesnt cover payments made by card, and it only applies when domestic 
payments (as the result of a scam) are sent to another person. Here Miss A sent a payment 
to an account held in her own name. And the scam occurred when she moved this 
purchased crypto from that account to the scammer. Im satisfied the CRM Code wouldnt 
apply in this scenario.
Should RBS have reasonably prevented the payments Miss A made? 
It has been accepted that Miss A authorised the payments that were made from her account 
with RBS, albeit on Xs instruction. So, the starting point here is that Miss A is responsible.
However, banks and other Payment Services Providers (PSPs) do have a duty to protect 
against the risk of financial loss due to fraud and/or to undertake due diligence on large 
transactions to guard against money laundering.
The question here is whether RBS should have been aware of the scam and stepped in and 
questioned Miss A about the payments she was making. And if it had questioned Miss A 
would it have been able to prevent the scam taking place.
RBS did step in late on in the scam on 21 September 2022, it had concerns about the 
payments Miss A was making and her account was stopped. However, during this call Miss 
A confirmed she was making all the payments herself and that no one else was involved or 
pressuring her to make payments.
In addition to this Miss A has confirmed X was coaching her on what to say to the bank. Miss 
A took out several loans to fund the investment and, on each occasion, X told her what to 
say on the applications. This included saying the loans were for things other than 
investments such as home improvements.
I think it could be argued the RBS should have stepped in sooner and questioned Miss A 
about the payments she was making but overall, Miss A had built trust with X and was willing 
to give false information to both RBS and other loan providers to make sure the payments 
were approved. I think its very unlikely that Miss A would have been any more honest had 
RBS had stepped in sooner.
As I think its likely Miss A would have given RBS false information had it done more, I dont 
think it missed an opportunity to prevent the scam and it is therefore not responsible for Miss 
As loss.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 January 2024.
