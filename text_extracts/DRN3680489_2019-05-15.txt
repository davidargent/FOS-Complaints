K821x#15complaint
Mr C has complained about short-term loans granted to him by CashEuroNet UK LLC 
trading as QuickQuid. Mr C says he couldnt afford these loans and that QuickQuid didnt 
take appropriate steps to check whether he could afford them when he took them out. 
Background
QuickQuid agreed seventeen short-term loans  for Mr C between November 2011  and 
June 2018. Each loan was repayable over between one and three months with the exception 
of loan 11.  Loan 11 was a flexible credit  agreement (flex-credit).  This was a credit  facility 
that allowed  Mr C to draw down money  up to a pre-agreed credit limit, with a view to 
repaying it  potentially over a period  of up to 10 months.
Mr C took out top-ups and re-finances  on several  of the loans, labelled  a. This is where  he 
either took out further borrowing under the same  agreement, before paying back  the initial 
amount borrowed;  or borrowed further  funds,  extending the term of the original agreement,  
agreeing a new repayment schedule.   There was also a gap of around two and a half years 
between loan 11 (flex-credit) being repaid,  and loan 12 being taken out. Ive set out a 
summary of the lending  below.

QuickQuid objected to this service considering the sale of loans  1 - 5, as it said the age of 
the loans meant they fell outside  of our jurisdiction. Mr C however agreed to drop his 
complaint about  loans  1 - 5, so the adjudicator reviewed the remaining loans - loans 6 - 17, 
including the top-ups  and re-finances of these  loans. 
One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Cs complaint already and recommended  the 
complaint be upheld in part. He felt the checks QuickQuid carried  out on loans  6 - 17 werent 
proportionate. He felt had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks  on loans 12  17, it 
wouldve realised these  loans wouldve  been unaffordable for him and would not have lent to 
him. He also thought  the pattern of lending for loans 6  11, meant it was irresponsible  of 
QuickQuid to have  continued to provide further loans at this point, so it shouldnt have 
agreed to these either.
QuickQuid disagreed with the findings. So as no agreements been reached at this stage, 
the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time.  
Our adjudicator, having looked  at everything, found  that QuickQuid didnt carry out 
proportionate checks for some of Mr Cs applications. And based on his review, he thought  
that QuickQuid should  refund the interest  and charges  on loans 6 through  to 17. These  
findings were set out in some detail in a view letter  to the lender. 
QuickQuid initially said that for loans 12  17 that it carried out appropriate and proportionate 
affordability assessments, including  validation of Mr Cs income and expenses before 
funding all these loans.  Its said it started  implementing changes to affordability assessments 
in June 2014 and all the changes were completed  by 28 February 2015. 
It said that starting 1 March 2015, before Mr C borrowed  loans 12 - 17, it had implemented  
an affordability review that was consistent  with the FCA (Financial  Conduct  Authority)  
Handbook and was in place at the time it received authorisation  by the FCA. And that its 
assessment was conducted properly and individually  for each of these applications. It also 
said that for some of the earlier loans it carried out credit checks.
QuickQuid raised this argument in both its initial submissions, and in response  to the 
adjudicators assessment,  along with additional arguments. However, our job is to look not 
only into the rules and regulations set by the regulator at the time of borrowing but also the 
law, good industry  practice and all the available evidence and arguments to help us decide  
whether we think what the business  has done  is right or not. And in this case I don't  think  
QuickQuid was right to provide Mr C with some of the loans he borrowed from 2015 
onwards, as well as some of the loans prior to this date.
This service has responded to QuickQuid on the above generic argument directly and 
through earlier final decisions. So Im not going to expand on this point any further here, 
though I have considered it alongside everything else in making my decision. 
Ref: DRN36804893I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the FCA guidance in how complaints are to be 
dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] 
which says that businesses procedures for complaint handling should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
So my decision will focus on the specifics of Mr Cs complaint and what both parties have 
said about this.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr C 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Cs income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Cs complaint. These  questions  are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr C would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr C would have been able to do so?
Ref: DRN368048942.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Cs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
1. Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks to satisfy  
itself that Mr C would be able to repay in a sustainable way? If not, would those checks have 
shown that Mr C would have been  able to do so?
As loans  1 - 5 are no longer in dispute, I havent  reconsidered the proportionality of the 
checks QuickQuid carried out on these loans as part of my assessment. And I havent 
recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loans 6 - 11 either, because I dont 
think that it is necessary  to do so. Ill go onto explain why in a moment. 
There was a gap of around  two and a half years  between  when Mr C repaid loan 11 (the 
flex-credit account) and when he took out loan 12. And I think this is significant enough a 
gap to constitute a break in the chain of lending. So I dont think  that loans 12 onwards  form 
part of that same pattern of lending Ive referred to above  in terms of loans 6  11. 
However, while there had been this gap in lending, the amount Mr C came back  to borrow  at 
the time of loan 12 was still significant.  Loan  12 was for £500, and when he re-financed  this 
loan just a few weeks later, his highest  monthly  repayment due was almost £1,900.
Given the size of the loan and the monthly repayments due, I think  at this stage, QuickQuid 
shouldve built a full picture of Mr Cs financial circumstances,  and looked to verify the 
information it was given, before agreeing to lend any further.
Had it done so, I think  it wouldve seen, that while Mr C was still earning in the region of 
£4,500 a month, he was spending  around  the same  amount towards  an online trading 
platform to purchase shares  and other investments  (of around  £53,000  in 2017). His bank 
accounts also show credits from this company for around £13,000. Mr C s explained that 
£53,000 was what he spent in the year which were essentially his losses, and the £13,000 
was his returns for the year,  essentially  his gains. Overall this meant  Mr C had spent, or lost 
around £40,000 that year, which equates to around £3,300 a month.
I can also see that Mr C was transferring around  £2,500 each month on the day he was paid 
to his partner  to cover his regular monthly  living costs and bills, which was much higher  than 
the figures hed disclosed  to QuickQuid. So I think had QuickQuid  carried out proportionate 
checks, not only would it have seen  that Mr C was continuously overdrawn, but it wouldve 
seen that with the amount  he was spending  on his living costs and towards the online trading 
platform, that his outgoings were exceeding his income; he was unlikely to be able to get his 
account back into a credit balance; and was therefore was unable  to meet the repayments  
on loans 12  17 sustainably, without having  to borrow more.  
I think QuickQuid wouldve seen the above  if it had it carried out proportionate  checks,  and 
as a result, would not have agreed to loans 12  17 or the subsequent top-ups or re-finances.
 
2. Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mr Cs indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful?
Ref: DRN36804895Ive looked at the overall pattern of lending.  Ive  looked to see if there  was a point at which 
QuickQuid should  reasonably have  seen that further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided 
any further lending.  Given the particular circumstances of Mr Cs case,  I think  that this point 
was reached when Mr C applied for loan 6. I say this because:
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed QuickQuid from loan 6 
onwards. And was in effect  paying  large amounts  of interest  to service this debt over 
an extended period
the amount  Mr C was borrowing was steadily increasing from loan 7 onwards, and 
QuickQuid ought to have realised it was likely  his indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably 
Mr C had rolled over repayments on previous loans. 
I think that Mr C lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time
the sheer number  of loans (loans  and deferrals) was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Cs ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans
So Im upholding  Mr Cs complaint about  loans  6 - 11 because the overall pattern of lending  
increased his indebtedness in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  and he lost 
out as a result.
Did QuickQuid act unfairly  or unreasonably  in some  other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr C in some 
other way.  
In summary,  I think Quick quid should  not have  agreed to loans 6  11, or loans 12  17, 
including any top-ups or re-finances of these  loans. 
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
I think QuickQuid was wrong to have  approved  loans 6 onwards. So it needs to refund all of 
the interest and charges Mr C paid towards  these loans.
Specifically, it should:
-refund  all interest and charges Mr C paid on loans 6 to 17, including  all re-finances 
and top-ups on these  loans;
Ref: DRN36804896-pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple  from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*;
-remove any negative information  about loans 12 to 17 from Mr Cs credit file;
-the number  of loans taken from loan 6 to 11 means any information recorded  about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 11 should be removed from Mr Cs 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Mr Cs complaint in part. 
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 June  2019.
