DRN-3749106
The complaint
Mr W complains that National Westminster Bank Plcs online banking facility was 
unavailable. Mr W also complains about delays when trying to get help from NatWest. 
What happened
Mr Ws explained that he needed to make an urgent transfer to his partner at around 
midnight one evening so she could get a taxi. But when Mr W tried to access his online and 
mobile banking facilities he saw an error message and wasnt able to log in. As a result, 
Mr W was unable to transfer money to his partner. 
Mr Ws told us he tried to complete an online chat with an agent at NatWest but there was a 
delay. Mr W checked the service update page at NatWest but didnt find any issues. And 
Mr Ws told us it took around 40 mins to get connected to a support agent via an online chat. 
NatWest advised the online banking systems issues that were resolved the day after Mr W 
tried to gain access. NatWest apologised for the delay and service provided and paid Mr W 
£50 for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
Mr W referred his complaint to us and it was passed to an investigator. They thought 
NatWest had dealt with Mr Ws complaint fairly and didnt ask it to increase the offer or take 
further action. Mr W asked to appeal and said NatWest had failed to inform him about the 
technical problems it experienced. Mr W also said it had taken too long to get through to an 
agent at NatWest and didnt agree the £50 compensation payment was fair. As Mr W asked 
to appeal his complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Ws told us hed expect NatWest to notify customers about technical problems with its 
online banking systems. I agree that approach would be the ideal, but NatWest has said its 
not always possible or practical to give updates of that nature. Ive looked at NatWests 
online banking terms and conditions to see whether this scenario is covered. The terms and 
conditions are available on NatWests website. They say: 
Availability of Service
There may be times when online Banking is unavailable for you to use due to maintenance, 
repairs or upgrades or the systems of any party we use to provide Online Banking. Well aim 
to notify you in advance of any maintenance work but its not always possible to do so. 
Please contact us if youre unable to use the service and well do our best to help. 
The online banking terms and conditions, which set out the basis on which NatWest provides 
that service, say it will aim to notify customers about systems problems but its not always 
possible. So whilst I agree it was inconvenient for Mr W, Im satisfied NatWest has acted in 
line with its terms. 
In this case, NatWest confirmed it had a systems issue that needed to be repaired. Again, I 
dont doubt this caused Mr W some inconvenience and I understand he urgently needed to 
transfer funds. But, we all experience some inconvenience in our day to day life. And Im 
satisfied the information shows there were technical issues that meant the online and mobile 
banking facilities were unavailable when Mr W attempted a transfer. Whilst I appreciate it 
was inconvenient for Mr W, I havent been persuaded that NatWest treated him unfairly.  
Mr Ws also told us it took a long time to get through to an agent via its online chat facility. I 
accept that is the case. NatWests final response offered its apologies for this delay and the 
service provided. NatWest also paid Mr W £50 to reflect the distress and inconvenience 
caused. Ive read and considered everything Mr W has told us about the circumstances of 
his complaint and how they impacted him. Having done so, Im satisfied NatWests decision 
to uphold Mr Ws complaint is reasonable and the £50 settlement it paid fairly reflects the 
impact of the issues raised. 
As Im satisfied NatWest has paid compensation that is fair and reasonable in all the 
circumstances Im not telling it to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint because National Westminster Bank Plc 
has already paid a settlement that is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 January 2023.
