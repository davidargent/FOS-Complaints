The complaint
Mr W complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes 
being represented in his complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mr W and his wife entered into a purchase agreement to upgrade their holiday club 
membership in September 2006. The price of the upgrade was £3,900, they paid a deposit 
of £1,500 and Mr W entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay 
the balance of £2,400. Barclays Partner Finance says that the credit was fully settled by 
September 2008 but a claim was made to it in April 2017 that it had paid a commission to 
the holiday company which hadnt been disclosed to Mr W and which rendered the 
agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act. 
Barclays Partner Finance said that it has no obligation to disclose any commission that may 
or may not have been paid to the holiday company and Mr W had no obligation to use a loan 
from it and could have financed the purchase by whatever means he chose. Mr W wasnt 
satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service that the timeshare 
company and Barclays Partner Finance had failed to conduct a proper assessment of 
Mr Ws ability to afford the loan, Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the 
timeshare company which wasnt declared to Mr W and the timeshare company unduly 
pressured Mr W into entering into the agreements, all of which made the relationship unfair 
under section 140A. Mr Ws representative then made a complaint to Barclays Partner 
Finance that the holiday company had acted as an unregulated credit broker but that wasnt 
included in the complaint that had been made to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld. She considered 
whether Mr W could make a claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act about any 
misrepresentations made by the holiday company. She said that Mr Ws claim was more 
than likely time barred under the Limitation Act 1980 so she thought that Barclays Partner 
Finances decision not to look into his claim under section 75 and section 140A was fair.
Mr Ws representative, on his behalf, says that it doesnt agree with our investigators 
recommendation and has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. It 
says, in summary, that this service can deal with the complaint, Barclays Partner Finance 
was authorised at the time of the purchase by the Office of Fair Trading and is now 
authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority and the holiday company was acting as its 
agent; and the complaint is made pursuant to section 140A and is within the time limits 
prescribed, as it was made within six years of the final payment being made by Mr W.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigators recommendation that Barclays Partner 
Finances decision not to look into Mr Ws claim was fair, but for these reasons:
the claim that was made to Barclays Partner Finance by Mr Ws representative in 
April 2017 was that it had paid a commission to the holiday company which hadnt 
been disclosed to Mr W and which rendered the agreement unfair pursuant to section 
140A;
that claim didnt include a claim under section 75 that the membership had been 
misrepresented to Mr W or a claim under section 140A that Barclays Partner Finance 
failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mr Ws ability to afford the loan or that the 
holiday company unduly pressured Mr W into entering into the agreements or that 
the holiday company had acted as an unregulated credit broker  and as the April 
2017 claim wasnt made to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues, Im unable 
to consider them in this decision;
if Mr W wants to make a separate complaint about those issues, he should first 
complain to Barclays Partner Finance and then, if hes not satisfied with its response, 
he may be able to make a separate complaint but he should be aware that any such 
claims may be time-barred under the Limitation Act;
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Ws complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down his section 140A 
claim under the Limitation and I consider that he referred his complaint to this service 
within six years of the event that hes complained about  which is the turning down 
of his claim - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act applies to his claim - 
Im not determining the outcome of his claim under section 140A as only a court 
would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner 
Finances response to his claim was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance has provided evidence to show that Mr W had fully settled 
the credit that was provided to him to pay for the membership by September 2008 - 
so Mr W would need to have made a claim to Barclays Partner Finance within six 
years of September 2008  but he didnt make a claim to it until April 2017, which 
was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mr Ws representative says that the claim was made within six years of the final 
payment being made by Mr W and that Mr W now knows that a commission was paid 
by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company which was concealed from him 
so the limitation period doesnt begin to run until the time that Mr W became aware of 
it in accordance with section 32 of the Limitation Act;
section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors 
right of action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with 
reasonable diligence have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that 
deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some 
time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was 
paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company and from what this 
service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be 
low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner Finance didnt 
breach any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any regulatory 
duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these circumstances - and I 
dont consider that the level of commission that was normally paid in this type of 
situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays Partner Finance should have 
appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr W risked the relationship 
being unfair under section 140A;
Im not persuaded that any commission was deliberately concealed from Mr W 
and Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that Mr W still had 
outstanding credit with Barclays Partner Finance under the credit agreement in 
the six years before the claim was made to it in April 2017  so I consider that 
Mr Ws claim is time-barred under the Limitation Act;
even if Mr Ws claim wasnt time-barred, Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the relationship between Mr W and Barclays Partner 
Finance was unfair in these circumstances and I dont consider it to be likely that 
a court would conclude that the relationship was unfair;
I dont consider that Barclays Partner Finance properly considered the reasons that it 
wasnt progressing with Mr Ws claim so I cant say that it acted fairly and reasonably 
in response to his claim  but I consider that it wouldnt have upheld the claim if it had 
properly considered it as it would have said that the claim wasnt made within the 
time periods set out in the Limitation Act; and 
I sympathise with Mr W and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their holiday 
club membership and the difficulties that hes described, but I find that it wouldnt be 
fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance 
to refund to him any of the money that he paid for the holiday club membership, to 
pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ws complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 July 2022.
