The complaint
Ms G complains about MotoNovo Finance Limiteds response to a fire which destroyed a car 
that had been supplied to her under a hire purchase agreement.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Ms G under a hire purchase agreement with MotoNovo Finance 
that she electronically signed in August 2019. The car was written-off in a fire in September 
2019 and Ms Gs insurance policy was voided. She complained to MotoNovo Finance and 
said that she wanted to reject the car. It didnt uphold her complaint so she complained to 
this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He thought that it 
was likely that the issue that caused the fire was down to wear and tear of the car due to its 
age and mileage so he said that he was unable to reasonably ask MotoNovo Finance to 
allow Ms G to reject the car.
Ms G has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She says, in 
summary, that the car shouldnt have spontaneously caught fire if it had had a full service 
and inspection before being supplied to her, the fire wasnt caused by her driving style and 
she hadnt put the wrong fuel in it. She says that the dealer should take part of the 
responsibility for the car because it supplied it and it was pumping out blue smoke.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
MotoNovo Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it 
was of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Ms G - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car that was supplied to Ms G was more than four years old, had been driven for 
79,965 miles and had a price of £9,470;
Ms G says that the car was pumping out blue smoke after it was supplied to her but 
Ive seen no evidence to show that shed complained to the dealer or MotoNovo 
Finance about any issues with the car before the fire  and I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect her to have returned the car to the dealer and not to have 
driven it on a motorway if she was concerned about issues with the car;
the car caught fire and was written-off in September 2019  the fire services 
incident report says that the fire was caused by: Faulty fuel supply, petrol product;
I dont consider that the incident report would have involved a mechanical inspection 
of the car and Im not persuaded that it shows that the car wasnt of satisfactory 
quality when it was supplied to Ms G;
Ms Gs insurance policy on the car was voided by her insurance company so it didnt 
cover the loss that she incurred when the car was written-off  so she complained 
to MotoNovo Finance and said that she wanted to reject the car;
both Ms G and MotoNovo Finance have tried to arrange an inspection of the car but 
that hasnt been possible and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that the fire was caused by a fault with the car that was present when the car 
was supplied to Ms G, that the car hadnt been inspected or serviced by the dealer 
before it was supplied to her, or that it wasnt of satisfactory quality at that time;
I have no doubt that the fire would have been an extremely scary incident for Ms G, 
particularly as her children were involved, and I sympathise with her for that, the 
issues that shes been caused by her insurance being voided and the costs that 
shes incurred in paying for a car that shes unable to use;
Ms G had agreed to make 59 monthly payments of £211.59 and a final payment of 
£212.59 for the car to be supplied to her and shed also agreed to keep the car 
insured;
because the car has been written-off in a fire and Ms Gs insurance has been 
voided, MotoNovo Finance has lost its asset through no fault of its own and Im not 
persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to allow Ms G to 
reject the car or to waive some, or all, of the payments that are due from her under 
the agreement; and
I consider that MotoNovo Finance has acted correctly in its dealings with Ms G and I 
find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to 
end the hire purchase agreement, to pay any compensation to Ms G or to take any 
other action in response to her complaint.
I suggest that Ms G contacts MotoNovo Finance (if she hasnt already done so) to discuss 
her options for paying the amounts that she owes to it under the hire purchase agreement. If 
shes experiencing financial difficulties, its required to respond to those financial difficulties 
positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Gs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 May 2021.
