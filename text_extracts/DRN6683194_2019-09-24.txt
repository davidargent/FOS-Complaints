K820x#14complaint
Mr E complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA allowed a payment to him to go through  
and then took it back a few weeks  later. 
Mr E wants  his money back from PayPal. 
background
Mr E advertised a TV for sale on eBay.  He got a buyer  through  eBay and received  payment 
through PayPal  of Â£1360  in early July 2018.  
He contacted eBay to see if it was okay to arrange collection with the buyer. He was assured 
by them  that it was as he had received payment. 
The buyer picked  up the TV from Mr E. 
In August  2018,  Mr E was alerted that the buyer mightnt have been genuine. PayPal said 
that the owner of the card that had been  used for the transaction  had requested  a 
chargeback. This had been approved. PayPal wanted to claim the money  back  from Mr E. 
PayPal took some of the money from Mr Es PayPal account and asked  him for the balance. 
Mr E brought a complaint.  He felt that he had checked that it was okay  to let the buyer 
collect the TV and now he had no TV and he also had to pay back the money that he got for 
it. 
Mr E also brought  the complaint to us.
PayPal told Mr E that he wasnt covered by their seller protection because he allowed  
collection of the TV. The protection didnt apply where collection had been allowed or if the 
seller had delivered the goods himself. 
Mr E didnt agree with this decision so he asked us to look into it. 
Our investigator found that PayPal were  entitled to claim back  the money because  they had 
followed their rules. Mr E wasnt protected by PayPal because he had allowed collection of 
the TV. 
Mr E didnt think that this was a fair outcome  so the complaint has now come to me. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im afraid that Mr E wont be happy  with my decision. Im not upholding the complaint. I can 
see why Mr E thinks that what has happened  is unfair especially as he is out of pocket and 
without a TV. It certainly doesnt seem fair but Ill explain the reason for my decision.  
Ref: DRN66831942There are a number of things going  on in this complaint:
1.The chargeback  being successful for the card owner.
2.PayPal taking back the money  from Mr E.
3.EBay assuring  Mr E that it was okay to allow collection of the TV. 
4.The buyer not being genuine and, effectively, taking the TV without payment.
The chargeback is entirely a matter for the card scheme from Visa,  AmEx or Mastercard. 
PayPal have no say in whether they allow a chargeback  or not. So, I cant  consider this here 
as PayPal couldnt control this. 
EBay did assure Mr E that collection of the TV was okay. But, again,  this has nothing  to do 
with PayPal so I wont  be considering it here. Mr E might want to take this up directly with 
eBay. 
I see that Mr E has already been in touch  with fraud investigators regarding  the person who 
collected his TV. Again,  this isnt something  that PayPal wouldve been  able to help with so I 
wont consider this here. 
For this complaint, the only thing that I can deal with is whether PayPal have acted fairly and 
reasonably in taking back  the money from Mr E. As they couldnt control the chargeback, the 
only thing that PayPal couldve done  is to offer Mr E seller protection.  Ive read their rules  
and they do clearly state that this protection wont be offered if a buyer collects  the goods. 
So, I cant say that PayPal have done anything wrong here. 
Im truly sorry that this isnt the outcome  that Mr E hoped for. I do appreciate  that what  has 
happened to him is unfair. I think he needs to pursue this matter either through  the fraud 
investigation or through eBay which may or may not give him a positive outcome. I dont 
think that PayPal  have been  unfair or unreasonable here. 
I hope that Ive clearly  explained the reasons  for my decision. 
my final decision
I think that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA were entitled to claim back  the money from Mr E 
for his TV. So, I dont require them to do anything  else. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 October  2019.
