K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains that Omni Capital Retail Finance Limited wont  refund to him the money that 
hes paid it under a fixed  sum loan agreement for an HGV driving  course.
background
The details of this complaint are well known  to both parties and have been  set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I agree with the 
conclusions reached  by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr M electronically  signed a fixed sum loan agreement with Omni Capital in August 
2018 to pay for an HGV driving  course   the loan agreement described the course as 
Medical, Cat C, ICPC with a specified course  provider   the cost of the course was 
£2,399 and he paid a deposit of £240 - so the amount of the loan was £2,159  which 
was to be repaid  by a payment of £55.27 and 59 monthly  payments of £55.16   the 
interest rate was 19.9%;
Mr M says that he was told that he would be contacted to arrange a medical and to 
book his theory test  but that didnt happen so he tried to contact the course 
provider on several occasions but it didnt reply to him;
he says that he became aware that the course provider had stopped trading so he 
complained to Omni Capital in February 2019;
it said in July 2019 that it had arranged for Mr M to receive  the course from an 
alternative course provider and it offered  to pay him £150 compensation because of 
the delay in organising  a replacement course;
Mr M complained to this service  and our investigator felt there had been  a breach of 
contract before the course provider stopped trading because the medical and theory  
test hadnt been  arranged  and she didnt think that Omni Capital sourced a 
replacement course within  a reasonable timeframe;
she recommended  that Omni Capital should: unwind the loan agreement; refund 
Mr Ms deposit and monthly  payments, with interest; remove any record of the loan 
from his credit file; and pay the £150  compensation to Mr M if it was put against  the 
loan balance;
Omni Capital hasnt responded to the investigators recommendations;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit  Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against  the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been  a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ms complaint about  Omni Capital,  I must  be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract  or misrepresentation  by the course  provider and 
that Omni Capitals  response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable 
 but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Ms claim  under section 75 as only a 
court would be able to do that;
Ref: DRN48258392Omni Capital accepts that theres  been  a breach of contract because  the course 
provider stopped trading so it arranged for Mr M to receive  the course from an 
alternative provider   but it said that there had been  a delay in that happening so it 
paid him £150  compensation;
but Mr M had registered  for the course in August 2018  and, when  the course provider 
stopped trading nearly six months later, the medical required as step 1 of the training 
hadnt been arranged and he hadnt  been able to start the course  I consider that to 
be a breach of contract by the course provider;
the replacement  course wasnt arranged by Omni Capital until July 2019, nearly a 
year after Mr M had registered for the course, and I consider that hed made  no 
progress with the course, at least in part, because of the course providers breaches 
of contract;
I dont consider that the replacement course  was an appropriate remedy  for the 
course providers breaches of contract in Mr Ms circumstances  and I find that it 
would be fair and reasonable for Omni  Capital  to end the loan agreement and to 
remove all information  about it from Mr Ms credit file;
Mr M had paid a deposit of £240  for the course and I find that it would also be fair 
and reasonable for Omni Capital to refund to Mr M that deposit and the monthly 
payments that hes made under the loan agreement,  all with interest; and
Omni Capital says that it paid £150  compensation to Mr M but, if he hasnt received 
that payment  or if it was used to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan, I 
consider that it would be fair and reasonable for it to pay that compensation to Mr M.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold Mr Ms complaint and I order Omni Capital Retail Finance 
Limited to:
1.End the fixed sum loan agreement at no cost to Mr M.
2.Refund to Mr M the deposit of £240  that he paid for the course.
3.Refund to Mr M all of the monthly payments that hes made under the loan 
agreement.
4.Pay interest on the amounts at 2 and 3 above at an annual rate of 8% simple  from 
the date of each  payment to the date of settlement.  
5.Remove any information about the fixed sum loan agreement that its recorded on 
Mr Ms credit file.
6.Pay the £150 compensation to Mr M, if it hasnt  already done  so or if the payment 
was used to reduce  the outstanding balance of the loan.
HM Revenue & Customs  requires Omni  Capital  to deduct tax from the interest payment 
referred to at 4 above. Omni Capital must  give Mr M a certificate  showing how much tax its 
deducted if he asks it for one.
Ref: DRN48258393Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 February  2021.
