When Mr E complained to Quidie about all the loans, it didnt uphold his complaint but as a 
gesture of goodwill, it offered to write off the outstanding balance on loan 12 and remove the 
loans from Mr Es credit file.
Mr E didnt accept this offer and referred his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service, 
where it was looked at by one of our adjudicators. Our adjudicator didnt think Quidie was 
wrong to lend loans 1 - 4, she said she didnt have enough information to say Mr E couldnt 
afford loan 5. However, she thought Quidie shouldnt have lent Mr E loans 6  12 as hed 
established a pattern of borrowing that suggested he was reliant on this type of credit and 
the lending had become unsustainable.
Quidie accepted the adjudicators opinion, but Mr E didnt, he said more loans should be 
upheld and that Quidie has unjustly registered a default on his credit file for loan 12 and this 
should be removed.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me  an ombudsman to make a 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Quidie needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out reasonable and proportionate checks to make sure 
Mr E could repay the loans on time, without suffering financial detriment, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to meet the repayments. These 
checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was being 
lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, 
in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Quidie should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
The lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income).
The higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income).
The greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Quidie was required to establish 
whether Mr E could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Quidie agrees with the adjudicators view that it shouldnt have lent loans 6  12 and has 
agreed to make things right for Mr E on those loans in line with the Financial Ombudsman 
Services recommendation. This recommendation also means the default and any adverse 
information recorded on Mr Es credit file as a result of loans 6  12 will be removed. I think 
that addresses Mr Es complaint about the default on loan 12. So, Ive focussed my decision 
on loans 1 - 5 as these are the loans that remain in dispute.
Before lending any of the loans, Quidie has provided evidence to show it asked Mr E about 
his monthly income and living costs, including credit commitments. It has also provided 
credit search results for the searches it carried out on Mr Es credit file for each loan.
Mr E declared his income as £1,400 for all loans and his living costs including credit 
commitments varied between £330 and £510. Mr E declared he lived with his parents at the 
time of the loans.  
Quidie says it verified Mr Es income using credit reference agencies and his verified income 
varied from £1,343 - £1,575. It also said it relied on data from the Office of National Statistics 
(ONS) when considering Mr Es living costs. Mr Es credit file provided details of his credit 
commitments around the time of each loan.
The credit commitments Mr E declared for each loan was obviously less than what the 
results of the credit search showed, I can see Quidie reacted to this by increasing Mr Es 
credit commitments compared to what it declared. Given the loan amounts, repayments and the stage of the lending relationships, I think 
Quidies checks for loans 1 - 4 went far enough. Those checks showed Mr E could afford the 
loan repayments over the term and was left with sufficient disposable income. Although 
there was some adverse information on Mr Es credit file around the time of these loans, the 
default and judgement were historic - from 2018 and 2019. Overall, the information on Mr Es 
credit file didnt suggest he was in financial difficulties, and I dont think Quidie was wrong to 
lend loans 1  4.
Ive fully considered the lending decision around loan 5 and from what I can, this was now 
Mr Es fifth loan around seven months. The results of Quidies credit search show that Mr Es 
credit commitments had increased. He declared his income as £1,400 and his living costs as 
£390. I think given that this was Mr Es fifth loan with the highest loan amount hed borrowed 
and Quidies internal notes showed Mr E had a further four loan applications declined aside 
from the applications that hed been approved for, I dont think it was sufficient for Quidie to 
rely on ONS data or an income checker through the credit reference agency. I think there 
was enough concern here for Quidie to seek to get a detailed understanding of Mr Es 
financial circumstances by conducting detailed checks that would have given specific 
information about Mr Es financial circumstances before lending this loan.
Where I dont think a business checks went far enough, Id usually consider what itd have 
been had it carried out sufficient checks. However, in this case Mr E hasnt provided details 
of his circumstances at the time such bank statements and so I dont know what Quidie 
would have found had it sought to obtain detailed information about Mr Es financial 
circumstances. So, I cant fairly conclude Quidie lent Mr E loan 5 when it shouldnt have.
The adjudicator recommended that Quidie put things right for Mr E in relation to loans 6  12 
as Mr E showed a pattern of dependence on short term credit. As Quidie has agreed, it 
needs to put things right for Mr E.
If Quidie has sold the outstanding debt on Mr Es account, it should buy these back if its 
able to do so and then take the following steps. If it is unable to buy the debts back, then it 
should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below. Quidie should:
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr E towards interest,
fees and charges on loans 6 - 11, not including anything already refunded.
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr E
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr E originally made
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Remove all interest, fees and charges from loan 12, and treat any repayments made 
by Mr E as though they had been repayments of the principal of the loan. If this 
results in Mr E having made overpayments then Quidie should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. Quidie 
should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D. If there is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts calculated in A and B 
may be used to repay any balance remaining on loan 12. If this results in a surplus, 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr E. However, if there is still an outstanding 
balance then Quidie should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr E. 
Quidie shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal already written-
off.E. The overall pattern of Mr Es borrowing for loans 6 - 12 means any information
recorded about them is adverse, so Quidie should remove these loans entirely from 
Mr Es credit file. Quidie should remove loan 12 and any adverse information 
recorded about loan 12 once the principal been fully repaid.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Quidie to deduct tax from this interest. Quidie should give Mr E a 
certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if he asks for one.
I think Quidie has taken reasonable steps by agreeing to put things right for Mr E in line with 
the adjudicators recommendation and I havent found it was wrong to lend loans 1  5. 
I wont be asking it to do anything further.
 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold Mr Es complaint about loans 1  5. As agreed 
Quidie Limited trading as Fernovo.com should put things right for Mr E in relation to loans 
6  12 as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 8 January 2024.
