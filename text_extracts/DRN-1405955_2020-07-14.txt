The complaint
Mr S complains that Black Horse Limited wont refund to him the monthly payments that hes 
made for a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Black Horse, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr S - whether or not it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time will depend on a number of factors, including the age 
and mileage of the car and the price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr S was about a year old, had been driven for 17,497 
miles and had a price of £22,441;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors; 
there were some issues with the car and Mr S returned it to the dealer three times 
between April and July 2019 but the issues continued;
he complained to Black Horse and it arranged for the car to be inspected by an 
independent expert in July 2019 when its mileage was recorded as 26,127 - the 
inspection report concluded that the car was faulty and that:  the reported fault 
would have been present at the point of sale; 
due to the faults Black Horse offered to collect the car, close the agreement, refund 
Mr Ss deposit of £5,000 with interest and pay him £150 compensation for the trouble 
and upset caused;
I consider that its offer was fair and reasonable in the circumstances but Mr S says 
that he should also receive a refund of the monthly payments that hes made under 
the agreement;
Mr S was able to use the car to drive more than 8,500 miles in less than four months 
between March 2019 when the car was supplied to him and July 2019 when it was 
inspected;
I consider that its fair and reasonable for Black Horse to keep the monthly payments 
that Mr S has made under the agreement as payment for the use that hes had from 
the car  and Black Horses offer included £150 compensation for the trouble and 
upset that hes been caused  so Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require it to refund any of the monthly 
payments to him; and
I find that Black Horse has responded fairly and reasonably to Mr Ss complaint  if 
he now wants to accept its offer, and hasnt already done so, I suggest that he 
contacts Black Horse about that offer.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 August 2020.
