The complaint
This is a complaint that AXA France IARD (formerly trading as Financial Insurance Company 
Limited) mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) to Mrs H. AXA didnt actually sell the 
policy, but it has taken responsibility for the sale. So Ill refer to it as the seller. 
What happened
I issued my provisional decision on 8 May 2020. A copy of my provisional decision 
is attached and forms part of this final decision.
My provisional decision set out the background to this complaint. It explained why I 
didnt think that Mrs Hs complaint should be upheld.
Neither AXA nor Mrs H responded to my provisional decision with any further comments or 
information.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither AXA nor Mrs H have provided me with any further comments or information 
following my provisional decision, I see no reason to change the conclusion I reached in it.
So I still dont think the complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
For the reasons given above and in my provisional decision, I dont uphold this 
complaint against AXA France IARD.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 July 2020.
