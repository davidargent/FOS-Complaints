The complaint
Mr and Mrs C complain that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays 
Partner Finance, has rejected the claims that theyve made under the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. Theyre being represented in their complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs C entered into an acquisition agreement for a timeshare in October 2009 and 
they also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for 
the timeshare. They say that they became aware in March 2018 that they had cause to 
make a claim to Barclays Partner Finance under the Consumer Credit Act and they made a 
claim to it under section 140 of that Act in September 2018. 
Barclays Partner Finance hadnt issued a substantive response to that claim by March 2020 
so a complaint was made to this service. Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that:
Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the timeshare company which was 
not declared to Mr and Mrs C;
the timeshare company failed to conduct a proper assessment of Mr and Mrs Cs 
ability to afford the loan;
it unduly pressured Mr and Mrs C into entering into a contract with the timeshare 
company and a loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance;
the timeshare was misrepresented to Mr and Mrs C; and,
the timeshare company used aggressive commercial practices to pressure Mr and 
Mrs C;
all rendering the agreement unfair under section 140. It said that the claim should also be 
considered under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Cs complaint should be upheld. She 
said that Mr and Mrs Cs claim was more than likely time barred under the Limitation Act 
1980 so she thought that Barclays Partner Finances decision not to look into their claim was 
fair. She also said she hadnt seen anything that would suggest that the lending was 
unaffordable for Mr and Mrs C.
Mr and Mrs Cs representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It says, in summary, that:
there is no statutory time limit on raising a complaint under the Consumer Credit Act 
or for asking this service to look into a refusal by a creditor to properly investigate a 
complaint and the time limit of six years applies to the raising of a court action;
Mr and Mrs C only discovered the actual characteristics of the product many years 
after they purchased it  its a long term contract with unlimited liability for 
management charges which was concealed at the point of purchase and is unduly 
onerous;
the existence and the amount of commission paid by Barclays Partner Finance were 
concealed from Mr and Mrs C at the point of sale and the limitation period under 
section 140 is postponed under section 32 of the Limitation Act until they could be 
aware of those facts with reasonable diligence and that they only became aware of 
the non-disclosure when they sought professional advice in 2018;
the loan has all the hallmarks of an unaffordable loan given the interest rate and that 
no affordability assessment was made before the loan was made to Mr and Mrs C - 
theres an unfair creditor-debtor relationship under section 140A and Mr and Mrs C 
have exercised more than reasonable diligence in complaining about the affordability 
assessment; and 
the date that Mr and Mrs C sought advice is the date of knowledge for the purposes 
of the six year limitation period.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr and Mrs Cs complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down their claims 
under the Limitation Act and their representative says that theres no statutory time 
limit on raising a complaint under the Consumer Credit Act and the time limit of six 
years applies to the raising of a court action;
I accept that Mr and Mrs C have referred their complaint to this service within six 
years of the event that theyve complained about  which is the turning down of their 
claims under the Consumer Credit Act - but I need to consider whether Barclays 
Partner Finance has acted fairly in saying that the Limitation Act applies to their 
claims;
Mr and Mrs Cs claims are under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  
in this decision Im not determining the outcome of those claims as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances 
response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr and Mrs Cs claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented to 
them and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to them;
in making a claim under the Consumer Credit Act, Mr and Mrs C are seeking a legal 
remedy, so if Barclays Partner Finance turned down their initial claim, they would be 
able to ask a court to consider it or ask our service to assess if Barclays Partner 
Finance had acted fairly  but that means that Barclays Partner Finance is able to 
consider any legal defence it may have to their claims, whether or not Mr and Mrs C subsequently decided to take their claim to court - so although the Consumer Credit 
Act doesnt contain any explicit time limits within the body of the legislation, Im 
satisfied that the Limitation Act does apply in the way it does to all legal claims;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr and Mrs C could have made a claim to the timeshare company or 
Barclays Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that they say induced them 
into buying the timeshare soon after they entered into the agreement to buy the 
timeshare in October 2009 as that was when they entered into an agreement based 
on the alleged misrepresentations of the timeshare company and say that they 
suffered a loss as they entered into the loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance to pay for the timeshare;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at about that time, so they would have 
had six years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or 
Barclays Partner Finance  but they didnt make a claim against Barclays Partner 
Finance until September 2018, which was nearly nine years later so outside of the 
time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that Mr and Mrs C only became aware that they 
could make a claim to Barclays Partner Finance after they sought advice from it in 
2018  but when they had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist them for the 
purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim under some sections of 
that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the 
cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that those sections are applicable to Mr 
and Mrs Cs claims;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr 
and Mrs C and Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, 
amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under 
a credit agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the 
debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that Mr and Mrs C entered into the loan agreement in 
October 2009 and it ended in March 2011 - so Mr and Mrs C would have needed to 
make a claim against Barclays Partner Finance within six years of March 2011  but 
they didnt make a claim to it until September 2018, more than seven years later, 
which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that information about the credit agreement and 
timeshare was deliberately concealed from Mr and Mrs C and that they didnt 
discover the concealment until after theyd sought advice from it in 2018;
section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors 
right of action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation 
doesnt begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that 
deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some 
time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Mr and Mrs C and their representative have set out what they say happened before 
Mr and Mrs C entered into the acquisition agreement and loan agreement in October 
2009  but I dont consider that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a 
deliberate concealment of any relevant information, in fact many of the things that 
they say werent right would have been known to Mr and Mrs C at the time of the 
sale, such as the length of the contract and the intertest rate on the loan  so I dont 
consider that section 32 is applicable in these circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative has said that Barclays Partner Finance should have 
told them about any commission that it paid to the timeshare company for 
arranging the loan  but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what 
commission, if any, was paid by Barclays Partner Finance to the timeshare 
company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid 
it tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance didnt breach any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under 
any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to 
Mr and Mrs C risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Barclays Partner Finance hadnt issued a substantive response to Mr and Mrs Cs 
claim by March 2020 so a complaint was made to this service  I consider that it 
should have assessed their claim under sections 75 and 140A but it didnt do that so 
I cant say that it acted fairly and reasonably in response to their claims  but I 
consider that it wouldnt have upheld the claims if it had properly considered them as 
it would have said that the claims werent made within the periods set out in the 
Limitation Act;
Mr and Mrs Cs representative says that the loan was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs C 
and that no affordability assessment was made before the loan was made to them;
Ive seen no other evidence to show that the loan was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs C 
and they didnt complain to Barclays Partner Finance about the affordability of the 
loan or ask it for any information about the affordability assessment until 2018  as 
the loan was made in October 2009 and ended in March 2011, I consider it to be 
more likely than not that any complaint about the affordability of the loan would now 
be time barred; 
nor have I seen evidence to show that Mr and Mrs C were unduly pressured into 
entering into the acquisition agreement or loan agreement in October 2009 or that 
the timeshare company used unacceptable commercial practices against Mr and 
Mrs C  they didnt complain to Barclays Partner Finance about those issues until 
September 2018  nearly nine years after they entered into the agreements and I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have complained to Barclays 
Partner Finance about any such issues before then; and 
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs C for the issues that theyve had with their timeshare 
and the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to 
refund to them any of the money that they paid under the loan agreement, to pay 
them any compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Cs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs C to 
accept or reject my decision before 5 April 2022.
