The complaint
Mr and Mrs H complain that Aviva Insurance Limited over-priced their motor insurance 
policy.
Where I refer to Aviva, I refer to the above-named insurance company and I include 
employees and others insofar as I hold Aviva responsible for their acts or omissions. 
What happened
From October 2010 to October 2021, Mr and Mrs H had the same car and insured it with 
Aviva. Mr H also had other financial products from Aviva.
For the year from October 2021, Mr H got lower quotes for car insurance from other 
providers. He complained to Aviva that it had been unfairly increasing his premiums since 
2015.
By a final response dated 9 November 2021, Aviva turned down the complaint and told Mr H 
of the six-month deadline to bring his complaint to us. In late January 2022, Aviva extended 
that deadline to late June 2022.
Mr H brought the complaint to us in mid-June 2022. Mrs H later joined in the complaint.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that 
Aviva had treated Mr and Mrs H unfairly or caused them to suffer a financial loss. 
Mr and Mrs H disagreed with the investigators opinion. They asked for an ombudsman to 
review the complaint. Mr H says, in summary, that:
Aviva verbally advised him that he would have competitive prices every year because 
of the multiple-product discounts.
No claims were made, yet his premiums went up every year.
Aviva was taking advantage of his loyalty  that is price walking.
His car and his circumstances are still the same.
For the year from October 2021, Aviva would have charged him over £320.00 when 
his current insurer charged him £161.00.
For the year from October 2022, his current insurer has given him a renewal quote of 
£182.16.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach
The Financial Conduct Authority is the regulator of insurance companies in the UK. The 
Financial Ombudsman Service considers an individual consumer complaint. Where we find 
the business responsible for an unfair act or omission, we consider the impact on the 
complainant consumer and we may direct the business to put that right.
Different insurers may at different times, assess risk and set premiums differently. An insurer 
may increase the price of an insurance policy to a price above what other insurers would 
charge for similar cover. That doesnt necessarily mean something has gone wrong.
Some insurers have in the past offered new policies at a discount compared to renewing 
policies.
When deciding what premium to charge at renewal, an insurer must follow the principle of 
treating its customers fairly.
We wouldnt usually regard a policyholder as inert until he or she had failed to engage with 
the insurer for more than four years.
If the price increased because the insurer believed that a policyholder was likely to renew 
the policy without question, then we wouldnt think this is fair. This would indicate the price 
increases were only applied because of lack of engagement (or because of loyalty) and 
wouldnt be treating the policyholder fairly.
Wed expect an insurer to be able to demonstrate the price increases are due to its changing 
view of the risk and that these are consistent with other customers  regardless of their level 
of engagement. 
From about 2011, insurance premiums were subject to Insurance Premium Tax (IPT) at a 
rate of 6%. From November 2015, the rate of IPT was 9.5%. From October 2016, the rate of 
IPT was 10%.
Since April 2017, renewal quotes must contain a comparison with the price for the previous 
year  and contain a form of words about shopping around.
Since June 2017, the rate of IPT has been 12%.
Since January 2022, insurers can no longer charge a renewing policyholder more than a 
comparable new customer.
Mr and Mrs Hs complaint
Avivas premiums were as follows: 
2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021
£356 £366 £368 £328 £341 £373 £378
From its records, I accept that Mr H engaged with Aviva about the renewal in 2015. He 
agreed the premium of £356.I have no reason to doubt Mr Hs statement that Aviva told him he was getting a multi-
product discount and its prices would be competitive. But I dont find it likely that Aviva made 
a commitment to keep future premiums in line with other insurers.
The increases in 2016 and 2017 were due to the increase in IPT.
From 2017, Avivas renewal notices to Mr H included the required comparison with the 
previous year and the wording about shopping around.
There was no increase in 2018.
Mr H qualified for multi-product discount of about 10% in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Mr H hasnt 
provided evidence of what other insurers would have quoted before October 2021. 
Ive looked at Avivas pricing criteria. I havent seen any evidence that Aviva applied its 
criteria to Mr H differently to its other customers in similar circumstances regardless of their 
level of engagement. 
So, I dont think Aviva increased the price of the policy (in 2019, 2020 and 2021) to take 
advantage of Mr Hs loyalty or lack of engagement. Whilst its possible that Mr H mightve got 
a lower premium by shopping around, I dont think Aviva treated him unfairly.
So I dont find it fair and reasonable to direct Aviva to pay compensation to Mr H or to do any 
more in response to this complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct Aviva Insurance Limited to do any more in response to this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H and Mr H to 
accept or reject my decision before 21 December 2022.
