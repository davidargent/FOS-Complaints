In October 2022 Morses told us that the account was still open with a £10 outstanding 
balance on loan 9. 
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint after it was referred to the Financial 
Ombudsman Service. He thought that loans 5 and 9 (not loans 1 to 4 and not loans 6 to 8) 
ought to be the ones that Morses puts right for Ms F. 
Ms Fs representative did not respond and Morses has responded to agree to loan 9 but not 
loan 5. So, I consider that the only loan left in dispute now is loan 5. 
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Morses needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms F 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could consider several different things, such as how much was being lent, the 
repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a 
lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. Our adjudicator considered this applied to 
loans 5 and 9 in this complaint. 
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Ms Fs complaint in part and have explained why below.
Ms F didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about loans 1 to 4 and loans 6 to 8. 
Because of this I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. And 
Morses has accepted the outcome for loan 9. So, I wont be deciding about that lending. But 
they were part of the borrowing relationship Ms F had with Morses. So, they are something 
I will consider when considering the complaint.
Loan 5 comes at the end of the first loan chain as there was a significant gap in the lending 
after loan 5. I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks for loan 5 
because I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of 
Morses lending history with Ms F, with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Morses 
should reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. 
And so Morses should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the circumstances of Ms Fs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 5. I say 
this because:
At this point she had been indebted to Morses for over two years.  
Ms Fs first loan was for £150 and loan 5 was for £400. So, the amount Ms Fs 
borrowing had more than doubled as well as her having been indebted to Morses for 
a significant time. At this point Morses ought to have known that Ms F was likely borrowing to meet an 
ongoing and increasing need. And this indicates her problems may have been 
worsening.  
So, because of these factors, Morses ought to have realised it was more likely than 
not Ms Fs indebtedness was unsustainable. 
I appreciate that Morses feels that the checks it did were enough to show the lending was 
affordable. But I think the lending pattern itself shows the loan was not sustainable. 
I think that Ms F lost out because Morses continued to provide borrowing for loan 5 and at 
loan 9 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Fs indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended period of time.
the length of time over which Ms F borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on her ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im also upholding the complaint about loans 5 and 9 and Morses should put 
things right.
Putting things right
Morses ought not to have approved loans 5 and 9 for Ms F and so it needs to put things right 
for her. 
In deciding what redress Morses should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might 
have happened had it stopped lending to Ms F at loan 5 and at loan 9, as Im satisfied it 
ought to have.
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Ms F may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed 
between him and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this 
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to reconstruct now accurately. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Ms F in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or reasonable 
to conclude that Ms F would more likely than not have taken up any one of these options. 
So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Morses liability in this case for what Im satisfied it has 
done wrong and should put right. Morses shouldnt have given Ms F loans 5 and 9.
LOAN 5A. Morses should add together the total of the repayments made by Ms F towards 
interest, fees and charges on loan 5, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B. Morses should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms 
F which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms F originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. Morses should pay Ms F the total of A plus B.
D. The overall pattern of Ms Fs borrowing for loan 5 means any information recorded 
about it is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Ms Fs credit file. 
AND LOAN 9
Morses shouldnt have given Ms F loan 9 on which there is a small outstanding balance. 
Morses has agreed already to redress Ms F for this loan but the calculations done last year 
will need to be refreshed. 
A. Morses should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on the loan 
and treat any repayments made by Ms F as though they had been repayments of the 
principal. If this results in Ms F having made overpayments then Morses should 
refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, 
Morses should then refund the amounts calculated.
B. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated should be used to 
repay any balance remaining. If this results in a surplus then the surplus should be 
paid to Ms F. 
C. The overall pattern of Ms Fs borrowing for loan 9 means any information recorded 
about it is adverse, so it should remove it entirely from Ms Fs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to deduct tax from this interest. Morses should 
give Ms F a certificate showing how much tax Morses has deducted if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Ms Fs complaint. Morses Club PLC should 
put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms F to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 February 2023.
