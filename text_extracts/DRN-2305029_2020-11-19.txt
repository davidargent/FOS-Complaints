June 2018. These loans were a mixture of payday and instalment loans. Ive included a table

I think there are three distinct periods or chains of lending. These start at loan 1, loan 5 and 
loan 10 with breaks after loan 4 and loan 9. There were also some notable gaps within these 
chains.  
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that Mr Lender was wrong to 
approve the lending from the fourth rollover on loan 1 up to loan 4. He also thought Mr 
Lender was wrong to approve loan 9 and loans 12 to 16. 
Mr Lender agreed with our adjudicator that it was wrong to lend from the fourth rollover in 
loan 1 up to loan 4. It offered to pay compensation on this basis. But it thought that loan 9 
shouldnt be upheld due to the break in the lending within this chain between loans 6 and 7. 
And it thought more consideration should be given to the breaks in the last chain of lending - 
loans 10 to 16. 
Mr R broadly agreed with the adjudicators opinion. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me, an ombudsman, 
to issue my final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr R 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be 
an indication a consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case. The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow 
to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive decided to uphold Mr Rs complaint in part and Ive explained why below.
Mr R didnt disagree with our adjudicators opinion about not upholding part of loan 1, loans 
5 to 8 and loans 10 and 11. And Mr Lender has agreed to pay compensation from the fourth 
rollover on loan 1 up to loan 4. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing 
disagreement about these loans. So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. I have 
included the compensation offered in respect of loans 1 to 4 in the putting things right 
section below. And these loans were part of the borrowing relationship Mr R had with Mr Lender. So they 
are something I will take into account when considering the other loans he took.
So, to be clear Im only looking at loan 9 and loans 12 to 16. 
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate check for loan 9 would most likely have shown 
that Mr R was having problems managing his money. Looking at the information I have been 
provided I can see that his outgoings were higher than his income. And he was borrowing 
and repaying significant amounts to other short-term lenders at the time. He had been doing 
this for some time.  
I think that Mr Lender wouldve found out this information if it had made proportionate 
checks. And I think Mr Lender wouldve seen Mr R wouldnt have been able repay the loans 
in a sustainable way. So, I think that Mr Lender shouldnt have given loan 9 to Mr R and I 
think hes lost out as a result of this. 
Whilst I can see there is a break in the lending between loans 6 and 7. I dont think this is 
enough to start a new chain of lending. It is less that the break between loans 4 and 5 and 
the lending relationship is now just about into its fourth year by loan 7. So I dont think this 
break was enough to have led to Mr Lender thinking it didnt need to make more in depth 
checks before approving loan 9. 
Mr Ms situation was similar over loans 12 to 16. Loan 12 is early on in this chain but the 
amounts Mr R had been borrowing had increased and had had now had a lending 
relationship with Mr Lender for just under six years. So it was reasonable to have expected 
Mr Lender to have made more in depth checks over loans 12 to 14. 
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate check for loan 12 would most likely have 
shown that Mr R was still having problems managing his money. Looking at the information I 
have been provided I can see that his outgoings were still higher than his income. And he 
was still reliant on short-term lending to make ends meet. So I dont think the lending from 
loan twelve onwards in this chain is sustainable. 
And there is shorter, but notable, break between loans 14 and 15. But we are very far into 
the lending relationship, it was now over 6 years. So I dont think it would reasonable to treat 
Mr R as a new customer here and make lower checks because of this. 
Ive also considered the pattern of lending up to loan 15 and I think the lending history and 
pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that further lending would likely be 
unsustainable at this point. Whist there were some gaps in the lending Mr R had been taking 
loans from Mr Lender on a regular basis for over seven years now. So I think Mr Lender was 
irresponsible to continue lending after this point.
So, overall, Im also upholding the complaint about loan 9 and loans 12 to 16 and Mr Lender 
should put things right, in addition to the offer it has made about loans 1 to 4.
Putting things right
Mr Lender shouldnt have lent to Mr R from the fourth rollover on loan 1, and it also shouldnt 
have approved loans 2 to 4, loan 9 and loans 12 to 16.
A) Mr Lender should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr R towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.B) Mr Lender should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr R 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr R originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Mr Lender should pay Mr R the total of A plus B.
D) Mr Lender should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Mr Rs credit file in 
relation to the first rollover on loan 1, loan 2, loan 9 and loans 12 to 14. The overall pattern of 
Mr Rs borrowing for loans 3 to 5 and loans 15 to 16 means any information recorded about 
them is adverse, so it should remove these loans entirely from Mr Rs credit file. If Mr Lender 
has sold any of the loans it should ask the debt purchaser to do the same.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender to deduct tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
should give Mr R a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if Mr R ask for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I partly uphold Mr Rs complaint.
PDL Finance Limited trading as Mr Lender should put things right by doing what Ive said 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 December 2020.
