Mr Lender agreed to uphold Mr Ds complaint about loan 4 in line with our guidance, so I 
havent considered this loan further. For completeness Ive included this loan in my putting 
things right section below.   
Our adjudicator considered this complaint and didnt think there was any reason to uphold 
the complaint about loans 1  7 (exclusive of loan 4 which was upheld by Mr Lender.) But 
the adjudicator felt Mr Lender shouldve conducted a more thorough check of Mr Ds 
circumstances before agreeing to lend him loan 8. And had it have done this, it wouldve 
discovered Mr D was spending large amounts of money gambling each month, so he was 
unlikely to be able to pay back the loan sustainably. So, the adjudicator upheld the complaint 
about this loan only. 
Mr Lender responded disagreeing with this view. Mr Lender felt that as there were breaks in 
Mr Ds lending, at the time of taking out loan 8 Mr D had only borrowed 2 prior loans from 
them in this chain  so it says the checks it carried out were proportionate.
As Mr Lender disagreed, the complaint has been passed to me to reach a final decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr D 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Mr Lender should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish 
whether Mr D could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ds complaint. Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mr Ds 
complaint about loans 1-3 and 5-7 - and Mr Ds hasnt responded with any reasons as to 
why he doesnt agree with this. So as these loans are no longer in dispute, I havent 
considered these further in my decision. 
Mr Lender says it carried out an affordability check before allowing Mr D to take out loan 8 
in which it requested information about Mr Ds income and expenditure. Mr Lender also says 
it obtained Mr Ds credit score, so it feels it went above and beyond the checks it was 
required to do at this stage. Based on this information, Mr Lender says it had no evidence 
Mr D was experiencing any financial difficulty, so it maintains it was reasonable to lend Mr D 
loan 8.  I have seen that there was a significant gap in lending between loan 5 and loan 6 (the first 
loan in this chain). However, Ive looked closely at Mr Ds history of lending with Mr Lender 
and what it knew about Mr D at the time. Mr D had deferred repayments on loan 7 twice  
which is a sign Mr D was struggling with these repayments. He also applied to take out loan 
8 on the same day he paid back loan 7. He took out loan 8 for a much larger amount than 
any of his earlier other loans and the repayment term was also much longer. This suggests 
he is getting himself further into debt and its likely he took out loan 8 in order to repay loan 
7. So, while this information alone may not have led Mr Lender to draw the conclusion that 
this loan wouldnt be affordable for Mr D, I think it ought to have led Mr Lender to carry out 
further checks of Mr Ds circumstances. 
Had Mr Lender have completed a full check of Mr Ds financial position it wouldve seen that 
Mr D was regularly gambling large sums of money each month, and particularly in the 
months leading up to his application for loan 8. This is likely to mean that Mr D may have 
had an issue with repaying the loan in a sustainable fashion within the meaning of CONC. 
Gambling is highly likely to lead to debt. And with a debt situation arising out of, or 
contributed to by, gambling, then a properly carried out affordability assessment was likely to 
lead a responsible lender to conclude that a loan was not affordable for an applicant in that 
situation.
So, I dont think the checks Mr Lender carried out were proportionate and based on what Ive 
seen of Mr Ds circumstances from the time, I dont think Mr Lender shouldve lent Mr D 
loan 8. Mr Lender should put things right as set out below.
Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr D paid on loans 4 and 8;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans 4 and 8 from Mr Ds credit file;
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender must 
give Mr D a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Ds complaint. Evergreen Finance London 
Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 October 2020.
