The complaint
Mr A complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) didnt refund an unauthorised 
transaction in full and then passed the balance to a debt collector.
What happened
Mr A holds a PayPal account denominated in Sterling. An unauthorised transaction was 
made from Mr As account. The transaction was in a different currency.
PayPal agreed to refund the unauthorised transaction. But PayPal refunded Mr A in the 
different currency, and once exchanged back to Sterling it was less than the amount that had 
left Mr As account.
This created a negative balance on Mr As account, and PayPal asked Mr A to pay it. PayPal 
also stopped Mr A using his PayPal account.
After some time had passed, and the negative balance hadnt been paid, PayPal asked a 
debt collector to try and recover the money. Mr A complained to PayPal that this wasnt fair.
PayPal responded and said it felt it had handled things in line with its processes and 
procedures, so it hadnt done anything wrong. But PayPal was willing to refund the negative 
balance, of less than £25, and bring Mr As account to zero.
Mr A felt PayPal should also pay something for the emotional distress this situation had 
caused him, so he brought his complaint to this service. An investigator looked into things 
and felt that a payment of £100 would be fair to compensate for the distress.
PayPal disagreed and said it had acted in line with its user agreement, so it asked for an 
ombudsman to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres little dispute about what happened here, PayPal agreed to refund the unauthorised 
transaction. There was an exchange rate loss, Mr A received less Sterling than had left his 
account and PayPal then asked debt collectors to try and recover the difference.
PayPal says its not responsible for currency fluctuations and has acted in line with its user 
agreement. Whilst I agree that PayPal isnt responsible for changes in currency exchange 
rates, its user agreement  at the time of the unauthorised use  says:
12.4 Liability for Unauthorised Transactions. Without prejudice to your statutory rights, if 
you report that there has been an Improper Account Access related to your Account, and 
there is no evidence to suggest fraud or deliberate or grossly negligent behaviour by you, we 
will reimburse you in full for all unauthorised transactions sent from your Account.
I dont think PayPal has acted in line with its user agreement. PayPal didnt reimburse Mr A 
in full.
Mr As account was debited in Sterling, albeit for a payment in a different currency, and 
PayPal should have reimbursed Mr A the full amount that debited in Sterling.
And by not reimbursing Mr A in full this created a negative balance on the account, and I 
think this is PayPals fault. I dont think Mr A was responsible for the negative balance.
PayPal then sent this relatively small negative balance out to a debt collector to recover, and 
I think this is unfair. Mr A has explained that hes had some mental health problems, and 
PayPals actions have added to his worry.
Putting things right
The negative balance, and subsequent debt collection activity, all stems from PayPals initial 
error in not refunding Mr A in full. This has caused Mr A distress and because of this I think 
PayPal should pay Mr A £100 to compensate for this.
PayPals already offered to refund the negative balance and bring the account to zero, and 
this is a fair resolution to this part of Mr As complaint. PayPal should also stop all debt 
collection activity on Mr As account.
PayPal suspended Mr As account when the unauthorised transaction was investigated, and 
this seems a reasonable decision to protect the account, and Mr A, from further loss. PayPal 
has said it needs to identify Mr A, confirm bank details, and have Mr A change his 
passwords before it will reactivate his account. This seems reasonable in the circumstances.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
refund the negative balance on Mr As account, bringing the balance to zero
stop further debt collection activity
pay Mr A £100 for the distress hes been caused
provide Mr A with clear instructions as to how to reactivate his account
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 August 2021.
