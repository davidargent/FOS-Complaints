The complaint
Mr M complained that his account with PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) was 
suspended.
What happened
Mr M traded online and receives money through PayPal. In April 2020, PayPal froze the 
account and asked Mr M for information about his business.
Mr M complained to the ombudsman service in May 2020. He said that hed provided the 
information to PayPal, but the account was still frozen. This was meant he couldnt trade - he 
needed the money in the account to pay suppliers and staff. We asked PayPal to look at his 
complaint. Mr M said that the eight-week timescale for PayPal to respond wasnt quick 
enough.
PayPal replied on 3 June 2020. They said they placed a block on Mr Ms account on 20 April 
2020 while they asked about Mr Ms business. Theyd asked Mr M for information which had 
been reviewed and the block had been lifted. They could see that the situation must have 
been frustrating for Mr M, but they were acting in the best interests of PayPal and its 
customers. Their terms and conditions entitled them to suspend the account.
Our investigator looked at what had happened. She replied to Mr M in November 2020. She 
said that PayPals terms and conditions included the right to suspend the account where the 
account was thought to be high risk. This might be where there was a high number of claims 
and refunds. PayPal had shown her the number of claims made. Also, theyd been clear 
what information they required from him  projections, stock, supplier invoices, proof of 
shipping, bank statements. Mr M hadnt provided all of this, so they then asked for more 
information about invoices. In the meantime, the limitation remained in place until the 
information was sent in. On 27 May 2020, the restriction was lifted.
Mr M asked that his complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see how frustrating this must have been  a trading business needs money to pay its 
suppliers and staff wages. When PayPal froze the account, this meant Mr M was held back 
and couldnt easily trade. 
But PayPal were entitled to freeze the account while it made inquiries of Mr M. Its terms and 
conditions included:
Account Limitations 
Limitations are implemented to help protect PayPal, buyers and sellers when we 
notice restricted activities, an increased financial risk, or activity that appears to us 
as unusual or suspicious. Limitations also help us collect information necessary for 
keeping your PayPal account open. 
There are several reasons why your PayPal account could be limited, including 
where we have reason to believe that: . Your performance as a seller indicate your 
PayPal account is high risk. Examples include: indications of poor selling 
performance because youve received an unusually high number of claims and 
chargebacks, selling an entirely new or high-cost product type, or if your typical sales 
volume increases rapidly. 
PayPal froze Mr Ms account on 20 April 2020. On 21 April 2020, they asked for information 
about the business  projections, stock, supplier invoices, proof of shipping, and bank 
statements. Mr M only provided some shipping information. PayPal told us that Mr M said to 
them on 6 May 2020 that he needed 3 weeks to provide the other information. On 11 May 
2020, Pay Pal asked for more information and when it was received and reviewed, the block 
was removed on 27 May 2020. 
So PayPal were entitled to freeze Mr Ms account where the terms of Mr Ms agreement with 
them gave it the ability to do this. I also think that it was fair that PayPal did this in the 
circumstances here. When PayPal looked at Mr Ms account  they would have seen that 
there were a lot of claims for refunds due to non-receipt of goods and their quality. Thats 
one of the reasons PayPal gives when saying that it may want more information about an 
account and business.
I note that once the information theyd asked for was received and reviewed, they lifted the 
block on Mr Ms account within a day. I have looked at the communications sent by PayPal 
and they are clear what was needed at every stage that they asked for information. So I 
realise that Mr M might feel that PayPal werent entitled to do this and that it perhaps didnt 
need the information it asked him for. But looking at things impartially here, I think PayPal 
was entitled to freeze his account and ask for what it did and Im satisfied that the way it 
went about this was fair.
In his complaint, Mr M referred to the eight-week period that a business has to respond to a 
complaint. He said this was too long. The rules for dealing with complaints are laid down by 
the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and are not something this service has the power to 
change or comment on. But so that Mr M is clear, the rule is that a business generally has 
15 days to deal with a complaint about payment services  which this was. We sent Mr Ms 
complaint to PayPal on 12 May 2020 and they sent their response on 3 June 2020. This was 
20 days. 
If a business is going to take longer than 15 days (which it did), then it should advise its 
customer. In this case, I can see that PayPal asked for more information on 25 May 2020 
and said they were reviewing it on 26 May 2020  so they were keeping Mr M advised along 
the way. And they did what was necessary when responding within the overall timeframe of 
35 days that they had to respond to a complaint like this. So while I realise Mr M wont see it 
this way  I think that PayPal acted fairly in dealing with his complaint too.
All of this means that I think that PayPal acted fairly and reasonably overall here, and I wont 
be asking them to do anymore.
My final decisionI do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 February 2021.
