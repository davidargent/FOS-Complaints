The complaint
Mr O complains that the warranty for a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase 
agreement with BMW Financial Services (GB) Limited was misrepresented to him.
What happened
A used car was supplied to Mr O under a hire purchase agreement with BMW Financial 
Services that he electronically signed in September 2020. The dealer had agreed to provide 
him with a two year warranty but only a one year warranty was recorded by the 
manufacturer. 
Mr O complained to BMW Financial Services and said that he was rescinding the agreement 
because the warranty had been misrepresented to him. The dealer said that the 
manufacturers system wouldnt allow the second year of the warranty to be set up but that, 
as soon as the warranty was available on the system, it would honour the agreement and 
ensure that the car had a second year warranty. 
Mr O wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Our investigator didnt 
recommend that his complaint should be upheld. He didnt think that it was unreasonable for 
the dealer to apply the second year of the warranty at a later date or that there had been a 
misrepresentation.
Mr O has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. He has responded in 
detail to explain why the car was misrepresented to him. He says, in summary, that:
there has been a misrepresentation because he hasnt received a two year 
manufacturers warranty from the outset;
hes incurred cost in dealing with BMW Financial Services and cancelling his 
insurance;
he stopped making the payments for the car and BMW Financial Services has 
recorded missed payments on his credit file which has adversely affected him;
he withdrew from the agreement within 14 days; and
he hasnt been provided with an equal opportunity to be heard during the 
investigation of his complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances and on the basis of the evidence that has been 
provided to us;
although we do take account of applicable law and regulations we also consider the 
overall situation  so its possible that a court would reach a different outcome to the 
decision that Ive made;
there doesnt seem to be any dispute that the dealer offered Mr O a two year 
warranty and that he agreed to enter into the hire purchase agreement on the 
understanding that the car had a two year manufacturers warranty;
a one year warranty is recorded on the manufacturers system but the dealer  which 
is a manufacturers dealer  says that the manufacturers system wouldnt allow the 
second year of the warranty to be set up but that, as soon as the warranty was 
available on the system, it would honour the agreement and ensure that the car had 
a second year warranty;
Ive carefully considered Mr Os detailed response to our investigators 
recommendations and, although I understand Mr Os concern that the second year of 
the warranty wont be set up correctly which could cause him to suffer a loss, that 
hasnt happened yet and I consider that the dealers offer to ensure that the car has 
the second year of the warranty is fair and reasonable in these circumstances;
if for any reason, the second year of the warranty isnt set up correctly, I consider that 
it would then be appropriate for Mr O to complain to BMW Financial Services about 
that and then, if hes not satisfied with its response, he may be able to make another 
complaint to this service;
Mr O says that he withdrew from the agreement within 14 days as he sent a letter of 
rescission to the dealer in October 2020  but to withdraw from the agreement he 
needed to give written notice to BMW Financial Services and to repay the advance of 
Â£20,490 plus interest  Ive seen no evidence to show that he did that and Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that he properly withdrew from the 
agreement;
Mr O has stopped making the monthly payments to BMW Financial Services and it 
has recorded adverse information on his credit file  Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that BMW Financial Services has acted unfairly or 
unreasonably in these circumstances and I consider that the information that its 
recorded on his credit file is a true and accurate record of his payments; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require BMW Financial Services 
to allow Mr O to rescind his agreement, to reimburse him for any of the costs that 
hes incurred, to remove any of the information that its recorded on his credit file, to 
pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
I suggest that Mr O contacts BMW Financial Services about the arrears on his account and 
tries to agree an affordable repayment arrangement with it for the amount that he owes to it.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Os complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 June 2021.
