K820x#14complaint
Mr W says CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid) lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr W had two loans with QuickQuid in 2010:  a loan for £400 on 20 December and a loan for 
£900 on 31 December.  The second loan didnt run according to plan. It eventually ended in 
February 2012 when  the balance was waived.
Our adjudicator didnt  think the complaint should  be upheld. She said that the waiver of the 
loan balance  by QuickQuid meant  Mr W hadnt suffered a financial loss as a result  of the 
lending. Mr W asked that an ombudsman  consider  his case  but didnt give any reasons for 
rejecting the adjudicators view.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mr Ws case. 
As Mr W didnt provide any reasons for disagreeing with the adjudicator theres little I can 
add to what she said. Mr W borrowed a total of £1,300 from QuickQuid and repaid just under 
£1,100. The net effect of this is that Mr W paid no interest to QuickQuid overall,  so theres  
nothing I could ask it to refund and Mr W hasnt suffered a clear financial loss. The loans 
also no longer  appear on Mr Ws credit file due to their age meaning  theres  nothing  I could 
ask QuickQuid to remove  from his credit file either.
So even if I were to find one or both of the loans were lent irresponsibly, with no clear  
financial loss and no adverse information from QuickQuid on his credit file, theres  nothing  
I would ask QuickQuid  to do for Mr W. Im therefore  not upholding his complaint.
my final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint against  CashEuroNet UK LLC.  Under the rules of the Financial 
Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or reject my decision before 
6 October 2019.
