The complaint
Miss N complains PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) incorrectly reversed two 
payments from her account. 
What happened
Miss N says she provided business services to a client who paid her through her PayPal 
account. Miss N says she was informed the two payments were disputed by her client and 
despite her providing PayPal with evidence to show she had provided her client with the 
services, PayPal agreed with her client and debited Miss Ns PayPal account. Miss N says 
PayPal havent considered her evidence and wants the transactions refunded and 
compensation paid for the trouble this has caused her. 
PayPal says they have acted in line with their user agreement and Mrs N didnt provide 
compelling evidence to show that a service was delivered to the buyer. PayPal says she is 
now liable for any reversal of funds and the outstanding balance on her PayPal account. 
PayPal says they have offered Miss N a £200 courtesy credit to settle the complaint. 
Miss N wasnt happy with PayPals response and referred the matter to this service. 
The investigator looked at all the available information and upheld Miss Ns complaint. The 
investigator felt although Miss N wasnt covered by PayPals seller protection policy, she 
thought PayPal didnt fairly consider all the evidence Miss N had provided in relation to the 
dispute. As a result, the investigator felt the evidence provided by Miss N was sufficient and 
PayPal should refund the reversed payments and any associated fees to her account and 
pay £200 by way of compensation for the trouble and upset caused. 
PayPal werent happy with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to 
an ombudsman for a final decision. Miss N was also unhappy with the level of redress 
offered by the investigator. 
I sent both sides a provisional decision, where I said :
Ive considered all of the evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have come to a different outcome to that of the investigator and I will 
explain how I have come to my decision. 
I can understand it would be upsetting for Miss N to be informed her client had challenged 
PayPal over the service she had provided and then to learn PayPal had accepted her clients 
version of events, resulting in the payments to her PayPal account being reversed. 
What happened here is a dispute arose between Miss N and her client over the provision of 
services under a contractual agreement between them both. The first thing to say, as 
already highlighted by the investigator, is that its not the role of this service to determine the 
validity of the contract between Miss N and her client, thats a legal matter for her lawyers to 
consider. 
When making a full and impartial decision here, I will consider whether PayPal handled the 
dispute fairly when taking into account their own sellers agreement terms and conditions and 
the evidence provided by both parties. But to be clear, I will not look at the merits or 
otherwise of the underlying dispute between Miss N and her client for the reasons I have 
explained. 
In these circumstances where there is a dispute over the provision of services rather than 
say goods, its fair to say the proof of delivery of such arent always straightforward. So, its 
reasonable for PayPal to ask for Miss N to provide them with clear evidence she has 
provided the service to her client, as she says she has.
On this point, PayPal have provided this service with an extract of the user agreement, it 
says :
PayPal Seller Protection. Establishing proof of delivery or proof of shipment
The following is required as proof of delivery for intangible goods:
For intangible or digital goods, proof of delivery means compelling evidence to show the item 
was delivered or the purchase order was fulfilled. Compelling evidence could include a 
system of record showing the date the item was sent and that it was either:
 Electronically sent to the recipient, including the recipients address (email, IP,
etc.), where applicable.
 Received or accessed by the recipient.
Miss N feels the information she has provided PayPal was sufficient for them to support her 
side of events. I can see that Miss N and her client provided PayPal with email exchanges 
between them both and details of the contract. PayPal when questioned by this service on 
this matter, told us they have not seen valid proof or compelling evidence, that the service 
was delivered, as their user agreement refers to, and in particular no evidence was provided 
to show listings with UK retailers and or that retail accounts have been opened with UK 
retailers. What they have also told this service is they have weighed up the information they 
have seen and decided after due consideration, that Mis N wasnt protected by its sellers 
protection policy and decided in favour of her client. So, while Miss N may feel she has 
provided PayPal with various emails and contract details, thats not to say they must accept 
it as sufficient or compelling, nor can I tell them they must. 
Having looked at the evidence here, there is clearly some dispute between Miss N and her 
client over the service provided - its not my role to tell PayPal what they must accept or 
define as compelling evidence but to ensure they have taken the information into account 
and taken a reasonable view, and I am satisfied that is what happened here. I say this as 
from the information I have seen this isnt a matter of PayPal not looking at the evidence 
Miss N has provided, but more of a case that after considering it, they dont feel its 
compelling enough. 
As I mentioned earlier, I cant look into the validity of the contract between Miss N and her 
client, and while Miss N may not agree, on balance, I am satisfied PayPal have taken 
reasonable care when looking at this dispute, but in this instance they didnt feel Miss N 
provided them with the compelling  evidence, as they have described or required under its 
user agreement. I understand PayPal offered Miss N £200 by way of goodwill gesture and if this is still 
available, and I cant see why it wouldnt be, Miss N should contact PayPal to arrange for its 
payment to reduce any outstanding monies still owed.
While Miss N will be disappointed with my decision it follows, I wont be asking anymore of 
PayPal here. 
Both Miss N and PayPal responded to my provisional decision, so the case has been 
passed back to me to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered all of the evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
I gave both Miss N and PayPal until 2 September 2021 to accept or reject my provisional 
decision. PayPal have accepted my provisional decision, but Miss N did not agree and has 
sent further documents for me to consider. 
Miss N has provided this service with an extensive set of further documents and emails, but 
from what I have seen, the majority of these have already been provided to this service for 
us to consider, and what PayPal were provided with when they decided to take the action 
they did.  With that in mind I wont be commenting on every document, as I dont feel its 
necessary in order to come to a full and impartial decision here. Thats not to say I havent 
considered everything sent in  I have.
While I understand that Miss N feels that PayPal havent considered her weight of evidence 
fairly, from what I have seen, and as I have previously said, this isnt a matter of them not 
considering her evidence, but more of a case they dont feel its compelling enough. As I 
explained in my provisional decision, its not my role to tell PayPal what their terms and 
conditions must say or what has to be accepted as compelling evidence. What is important 
and what I have decided on, is whether they acted fairly when assessing both sets of 
evidence provided by Miss N and her client, and I am satisfied that is what happened here 
for the reasons I have already stated in my provisional decision. 
While I do have sympathy with Miss N here and understand her frustrations, I feel this is 
more of a contractual dispute between her and her client, which may be better addressed 
through a legal process, but this contractual dispute isnt something for this service to decide 
upon.
Unfortunately, PayPal dont believe the information provided by Miss N is compelling enough 
and from the further information provided by Miss N, I cant say this changes my original 
provisional decision and see no need to change or add to this, and so my final decision 
remains the same. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss N to accept or reject my decision before 1 October 2021.
