The complaint
Mr U has complained about the way that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) resolved 
the mis-sale of his payment protection insurance (PPI) policy.
What happened
In 2013, NatWest wrote off Mr Us loan, choosing not to chase him anymore for the 
outstanding balance of around £17,000.
In 2022, following a complaint about the sale of PPI, Mr U accepted an offer of around 
£2,700 in PPI compensation. NatWest wrote that all PPI payments are subject to the 
clearance of any outstanding debts.
NatWest then used the £2,700 of PPI redress to reduce the outstanding balance of the loan.
Mr U complained. Our adjudicator looked into things independently and didnt uphold the 
complaint. Mr U disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, so the complaints been passed to 
me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can certainly understand why Mr U would prefer to receive the PPI compensation directly. 
But I think its fair for NatWest to use the compensation to reduce Mr Us debt to them  Ill 
explain why.
NatWest have whats called the right to set off  to use the money they owe Mr U to reduce 
the money that Mr U owes them.
When Mr Us loan was written off, the debt did not cease to exist. It continued to exist, and 
Mr U still owes it  its just that NatWest decided not to chase him or to take certain legal 
enforcement action anymore.
So while NatWest owed Mr U about £2,700 for the PPI, Mr U still owed NatWest about 
£17,000 for the loan he never repaid. So it seems both fair and practical to use one debt to 
reduce the other.
Mr U said NatWest never contacted him to say the loan was still outstanding. But the loan 
still existed even if NatWest hadnt contacted him about it in a while, and NatWest were still 
allowed to set off his PPI compensation against the loan.
Similarly, Mr U said NatWest should have contacted him before using set off. Having looked 
at the relevant policy, I can see that applies to open, active accounts. But its not required to 
notify a customer before using set off to pay an account that was defaulted and written off, 
such as this loan. Further, it looks like NatWest did notify Mr U of the potential set off when 
they told him his PPI compensation would be subject to clearing any outstanding debts first  
and this loan was still outstanding. And ultimately, it was fair for NatWest to set off the 
compensation here, since Mr U owed them more money than they owed him. I dont think 
that the notification requirements made a significant difference to the fairness of it here.
I understand that Mr U is worried about this affecting his credit file. I hope I can reassure him 
that since the loan defaulted more than six years ago, it has fallen off his credit file and will 
not be visible to lenders at all. By setting off his PPI compensation, NatWest did not create 
any second default, and it will not affect his credit file.
In summary, I think it was both practical and fair for NatWest to use what they owed Mr U to 
reduce the much larger amount he still owed to them. And so while I know this will come as 
a disappointment to Mr U, I dont think NatWest need to pay him directly.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Us complaint in this case.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr U to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 December 2022.
