K821x#15complaint
Miss J says S.D. Taylor  Limited, trading as Loans at Home,  lent to her irresponsibly. She 
says she was in financial difficulty when the loans  were approved. And that she couldnt 
make the repayments.  This resulted in her becoming dependent  on the lending  over a long 
period of time. 
background
This complaint is about 22 home  credit loans Loans at Home provided to Miss J between  
January 2006  and December 2016.  Ive included  a table at the end of this decision which 
shows some  of the information that Loans at Home has provided.  
Loans at Home has written off an outstanding  balance of £1,470  on loans 21 and 22. It says 
this included £690 of unpaid capital.  
Miss J took three loans  in 2006. As our adjudicator explained I am unable to consider these 
loans as they are outside of our jurisdiction.  
Our adjudicator partially upheld the complaint. He thought that from loan 8 onwards the 
pattern of lending showed  the loans were  harmful. So Loans at Home shouldve  stopped  
lending at this time.  Loans at Home disagreed with the adjudicators opinion. It said that:
there were no definite indicators of financial distress. Any arrears  were minimal and 
the way the account  was managed showed  that Miss J was in control  of her finances; 
there was no evidence that the Miss J was persistently reliant  on the lending. Multiple 
borrowing and repeat lending are a feature of home collected credit;
we have viewed  this in the same way as payday or short term lending and this isnt 
right
A second adjudicator responded to these points.  Loans at Home asked for some  further time 
to respond, which has now passed.  Loans at Home didnt provide  a substantive response.  
So as no agreement has been reached, the complaint has been  passed to me to issue  a 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  high cost credit - including all of the relevant  rules,  guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Loans at Home needed to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss J 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN67746732But certain factors might  point to the fact that Loans  at Home should fairly  and reasonably 
have done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  
factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Js complaint. Ive decided to uphold Miss Js 
complaint in part and have explained  why below.
Miss J has didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion about loans 1 to 7. Because of this I 
dont think there is any ongoing  disagreement about  these loans. So I wont  be making a 
decision about this lending. But they were  part of the borrowing relationship Miss J had with 
Loans at Home. So they are something I will take into account when considering the other 
loans she took.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 8 to 22, because  I 
dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ive looked at the overall pattern of Loans  at Homes 
lending history with Miss J, with a view to seeing  if there was a point at which Loans at 
Home should reasonably  have seen that further  lending was unsustainable,  or otherwise 
harmful. And so Loans at Home should have  realised  that it shouldnt  have provided any 
further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Js case, I think that this point  was reached by 
loan 8. I say this because:
at this point Loans  at Home ought to have realised Miss J was not managing  to repay 
her loans  sustainably.  Miss J had taken  out five loans over the preceding 17 months.  
Shed been  indebted to Loans at Home for all of this time. So Loans  at Home ought 
to have realised it was more likely than not Miss Js indebtedness  was increasing 
unsustainably. I think this is itself is an indicator of financial distress  even if she were 
making the loan repayments on time;  
Ref: DRN67746733loan 4 (the first loan that wasnt  in 2006) was for £500 and loan 8 was for £600. At 
this point Loans at Home  ought  to have  known that Miss J borrowing to meet  a to 
meet an ongoing  need. I cant see why Miss J would have borrowed using high cost 
credit unless  she was dependent on the loans or she had no alternative
from loan 4 onwards  Miss J was provided with a new loan towards the end of the 
loan she already had running.  Miss J used the new loan to repay the balance  of the 
old one. So Miss J wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Loans at 
Home. In fact it was generally  increasing over time;
and Loan 22 was taken out over four years after loan 4. And it was for a larger 
amount. Miss J had paid large  amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
Loans at Home over an extended  period;
whilst  I accept that home collected  credit is different in some  ways to payday loans I 
still think the length of time and was likely to be harmful to Miss J.
I think that Miss J lost out because Loans at Home continued to provide borrowing from loan 
8 onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Js indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit over an extended period of time;
the length of time over which Miss J borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on Miss Js ability to access mainstream credit  and so kept her in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 8 to 22 and Loans at Home should put 
things right.
putting things right  what Loans at Home needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss J paid on loans 8 to 22;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number  of loans taken from loan 8 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 8 to 22 should be removed from 
Miss Js credit file.
If Miss J still owes Loans at Home any of the principal balance she borrowed on her final 
loan, then instead of the above for this loan, Loans at Home  should remove all the interest 
and charges applied to the outstanding balance. Loans at Home should then re-work the 
account as if all payments  made by Miss J went to towards the principal. But importantly, 
Loans at Home needs to make sure that Miss J doesnt repay more than the principal 
amount borrowed.  
If after doing this Miss J hasnt repaid the principal she borrowed Loans at Home can deduct 
this from the remainder of the compensation. If, Miss J has already paid enough to repay the 
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to her with 8% simple* interest from the 
date of payment  to the date of settlement
And if Loans at Home  no longer owns  this debt, and it wants  to make a deduction due to the 
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any 
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Miss J.
Ref: DRN67746734*HM Revenue & Customs requires Loans at Home to take off tax from this interest. Loans at 
Home must give Miss J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Miss Js complaint.
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things  right by doing what  Ive said above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Miss J to accept 
or reject my decision before 14 June 2020.
