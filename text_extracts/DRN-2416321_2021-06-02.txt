DRN-2416321
The complaint
Ms A is unhappy with the way that SureStone Insurance dac handled a claim under her 
home insurance policy for water damage. 
What happened
Ms A made a claim to SureStone after a leak from the boiler in the flat above hers damaged 
the ceiling and a wall in her kitchen.
SureStone accepted the claim. Ms A s ceiling and plaster were stripped so that the 
property could dry out. It instructed a contractor to carry out repairs.
Ms A complained to SureStone about poor service and delays. Amongst other things she 
said her oak worktops were splitting and discoloured as a result of the works, a cupboard 
above the boiler hadnt been put back properly, her cooker was dirty as a result of all the 
dust from the works, her sink enamel looked chipped, paintwork was flaking, shed had to 
arrange to have a light refitted and edging between the skirting board and laminate flooring 
rectified and her hall carpet was dirty. SureStone agreed that thered been some delays and 
paid her £100 compensation for that. Ms A brought her complaint to this service. In 
particular she wasnt happy with:
The fact that she wasnt able to use her kitchen for 10 weeks while the works were 
ongoing;
poor workmanship;
a lack of communication;
having to pay a £350 excess;
not being updated regarding recovery from her neighbour.

Our investigator upheld the complaint in part. He recommended that SureStone should:
repaint the flaking paintwork;
reimburse Ms A for having the light fitted and the edging rectified;
pay £500 compensation for the distress and inconvenience it had caused her;
clean the carpet; and
tell her whether it would seek to recover from her neighbour.

SureStone agreed with the first three points. It didnt agree to clean the carpet. It said it 
would only look to recover the excess if the cause was malicious as opposed to accidental 
damage. As the parties didnt agree, the matter has been referred to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As the parties have agreed what our investigator recommended regarding the paint work, 
the light fitting and the edging and the compensation, I dont need to consider those further. 
Ill look at the other points in turn:
oak worktops
SureStone said its contractor sanded and re-oiled the worktops with clear oil as a goodwill 
gesture. I havent seen any evidence showing the condition of the worktops before the 
repairs started. Because of that I cant fairly say that SureStone needs to do any more in 
respect of these.
cupboard above boiler
Ms A said the cupboard door and shelving was removed as part of the insured works and 
not put back properly. SureStone said this wasnt part of the insured works and was done by 
its contractor as a goodwill gesture. Ive checked the original scope of works and cant see a 
reference to this cupboard. So Im not persuaded that it was part of the insured works for 
which SureStone is responsible. 
dirty cooker
Based on photos of the cooker after it had been cleaned by SureStones supplier, I think the 
cleaning was acceptable and SureStone doesnt need to do anything more on this.
sink enamel
According to Ms A the enamel surface on the Belfast-type sink looks chipped. SureStone 
said it was an old sink and had been re-enamelled in the past. I can see that the surface isnt 
in very good condition. But its not clear to me whether it was like this before the repair works 
or SureStones contractor damaged it. Again, in the absence of evidence pointing to damage 
caused by SureStone, I cant fairly require SureStone to repair this.
hall carpet
Initially SureStone agreed to consider cleaning this carpet. It later said that the carpet was 
dirty because of Ms As dog and/or Ms A bringing dirt in from the garden. Ms A denies this. 
Ive seen photos showing how much dust and dirt was in Ms As flat after the lath and plaster 
ceiling was taken down. I think its likely that some of this would have spread to the hallway. 
So in order to treat Ms A fairly I think SureStone should be responsible for cleaning Ms Ss 
carpet.
excess
Ms A feels she shouldnt have to pay an excess as the damage was caused by her 
neighbours negligence. The policy terms say that a specific excess listed in the policy 
schedule, in this case £350, is payable in the event of an escape of water claim. 
Unfortunately for Ms A the policy excess is payable by her regardless of who was at fault in 
causing the damage. Im satisfied that SureStone has acted fairly, and in line with the terms 
of the policy, by applying the excess to Ms As claim.
Theres no contractual requirement for SureStone to seek to recover the excess from the 
neighbour. Nevertheless, insurers will often try to recover their policyholders excess 
alongside their own losses. I appreciate that its disappointing for Ms A that SureStone 
chose not to do so in her case. But I dont think its treated her unfairly in that respect. Ms A 
has the option to pursue her neighbour separately for this if she wishes.
I understand that Ms A is still unhappy with the level of communication shes getting from 
SureStone and its suppliers. In this complaint Im only looking at how SureStone has 
handled Ms As claim up to the time when it issued a final response in respect of her 
complaint being September 2019. Im sorry to hear that shes still having a problem in this 
regard but unfortunately she will have to bring a separate complaint if she remains unhappy with this.
Putting things right
To the extent that it hasnt already done so, in order to put things right I think SureStone 
Insurance dac should:
repaint the flaking paintwork;
reimburse Ms A for having the light fitted and the edging rectified;
pay £500 compensation for the trouble and upset it caused her; and
clean the hall carpet.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint in part and require SureStone Insurance dac to do what Ive set out in 
the Putting things right section above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 June 2021.
