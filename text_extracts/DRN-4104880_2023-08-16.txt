The complaint
Mr R complains that Everyday Lending Limited trading as GeorgeBanco.com contacted him 
for payment towards a guarantor loan very shortly after his friend passed away. 
What happened
Mr R was the guarantor for a fixed sum loan agreement that was taken out by his friend with 
Everyday Lending Limited trading as GeorgeBanco.com (GeorgeBanco). 
Sadly, Mr Rs friend passed away in October 2022. Mr R contacted GeorgeBanco to inform 
them of this. They then e-mailed Mr R on 1 November 2022 saying that responsibility for 
payment under the fixed sum loan agreement fell to him and asked him to call in and 
arrange this. 
GeorgeBanco then emailed Mr R on 23 November 2022 saying that they had been trying to 
get in touch with their borrower but hadnt been successful. GeoorgeBanco said that theyd 
take the contractual payment due under the fixed sum loan agreement from Mr R a week 
later. 
Mr R e-mailed GeorgeBanco back on the same day to let them know that his friend had 
passed away and asked them to put the account on hold while he spent some time tracking 
down his friends assets and liabilities.
GeorgeBanco replied the following day saying that theyd place a 30 day hold on the account 
to allow Mr R some breathing space and to stop automated arrears letters being sent to him. 
Mr R complained to GeorgeBanco saying that they had bombarded him with e-mails and 
texts asking for payment so soon after his friend had passed away. GeorgeBanco upheld the 
complaint saying that their collections agent should have been more sympathetic when Mr R 
first contacted them about his friends passing and that they should have applied a 30 day 
hold to the account at that point. 
Mr R wasnt happy with GeorgeBancos response to his complaint and so he referred the 
matter to us. Our investigator felt that GeorgeBanco should have been more sympathetic to 
Mr R. He recommended that they remove any adverse information they recorded on Mr Rs 
credit file and pay him £50 for the distress they had caused him. GeorgeBanco didnt 
respond.
Mr R didnt feel that £50 was enough and suggested that GeorgeBanco should pay him 10% 
of the amount paid to settle the loan in December 2022. 
As agreement couldnt be reached, Mr Rs complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
This complaint has been brought to us by Mr R in his capacity as a guarantor for a loan. 
While I have seen a copy of the fixed sum loan agreement that was entered into by Mr Rs 
friend with GeorgeBanco, I havent seen a copy of the guarantor agreement in place 
between Mr R and GeorgeBanco. However, I am satisfied that Mr R and GeorgeBanco 
accept that Mr R is the guarantor for this agreement and so I will proceed on that basis. 
Mr R contacted GeorgeBanco shortly after his friend passed away. Although I havent seen a 
copy of the e-mail they sent Mr R on 1 November 2022, GeorgeBanco has set out what that 
said. I find that the representative should have handled the matter much more 
sympathetically bearing in mind Mr R had recently lost his friend should have agreed to 
place a hold on the account immediately upon being notified of this by Mr R. I note also that 
GeorgeBanco e-mailed Mr R a few weeks later mentioning that they hadnt been able to 
contact his friend, when Mr R had already told them that he had passed away. 
GeorgeBanco apologised to Mr R, so Im satisfied that they realised they didnt handle the 
situation well. I find that because of GeorgeBancos lack of sympathy towards Mr R, that 
they should pay him compensation for the distress this caused him. I realise that this may 
disappoint Mr R, but I find that £50 is a fair sum in the circumstances. I also think it fair that 
GeorgeBanco removes any adverse information they recorded on Mr Rs credit file (if any) in 
relation to this loan.
Putting things right
GeorgeBanco should pay Mr R compensation and amend his credit file (if necessary) for the 
reasons Ive set out above. 
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct Everyday Lending Limited trading as GeorgeBanco.com 
to:
Pay Mr R £50 for the distress caused to him; and
Remove any adverse information they recorded on Mr Rs credit file about this loan 
after they were notified of his friends passing. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 September 2023.
