K820x#14complaint
Mr A says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid,  lent to him irresponsibly.
background
Mr A had ten loans  with QuickQuid between June 2011 and December 2012. 
QuickQuid offered to refund the interest and charges Mr A paid on loan ten, but said it would 
offset this against  the outstanding balance on that loan. Mr A said he didnt think this was fair 
because hed obtained a debt relief  order (DRO)  and he says this means there  was no 
longer an outstanding balance.
Our adjudicators issued  a number of views but ultimately told Mr A that it wouldnt be fair for 
QuickQuid to pay him anything. In simple terms, this was because Mr A had borrowed a total 
of £2,150 from QuickQuid, but only repaid it a total of £1,972.09. So hed paid less than the 
total principal he borrowed.  This effectively meant that, in net terms, there were no interest  
payments or other fees to be refunded to Mr A.
Mr A didnt agree with this and suggested QuickQuid should at least refund what he paid 
towards the last loan.  As there was no agreement, the complaint was passed  to me to 
decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any other relevant regulations at the time.
Having considered everything  both parties  have  said, I dont think it would be fair to ask 
QuickQuid to pay Mr A anything. And I dont need to consider whether  the loans were  
approved responsibly  or not. Ill explain why.
As our adjudicator set out, Ive seen that Mr A received loans totalling £2,150 from 
QuickQuid. And he made total repayments towards  those loans of £1,972.09. So overall, 
because hes paid back less than he borrowed,  I dont think  Mr A has lost out financially.
This Services approach  to putting things right for short-term loans we think shouldnt  have 
been approved  involves  a business  refunding interest and charges on those loans. But we 
still usually consider it to be fair and reasonable for a borrower to repay  the principal they 
borrowed. 
This is because the aim of any redress would be to put Mr A back in the financial position 
hed be in if any wrongly approved loans hadnt been lent. In that scenario, Mr A wouldnt 
have paid any interest or other fees  but also wouldnt have received the loan principal.
Overall, Mr A hasnt repaid the total principal amount he borrowed. So whether or not the 
loans were approved  responsibly, I dont consider it would be fair to ask QuickQuid to pay 
Mr A anything.
And turning to loan ten specifically, which Mr A mentioned in his response  to the adjudicator  
 he borrowed £750 and repaid just under £160. So in effect he hasnt paid any interest or 
charges on that loan and theres nothing  for QuickQuid to refund to him.
Ref: DRN19582562I dont think it makes  a difference that the principal amount for loan ten was written off 
following a DRO. Mr A still had the benefit of the principal he borrowed and didnt  repay it. 
I think its fair and reasonable to take that into account when considering any redress.
While I realise  this will be a disappointing outcome  for Mr A, for the reasons Ive given 
above, Im not upholding his complaint.
my final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint against  CashEuroNet UK LLC.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 March  2019.
