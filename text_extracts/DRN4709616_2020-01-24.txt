* Total borrowed  whilst  the account was running
** Monthly scheduled repayment if Mr O had borrowed  the full £1,000 limit on 10 Sep 2014 
Mr O says Sunny ought to have known he couldnt afford to repay the loans without having 
to borrow further. He says this resulted  in him being  trapped in a debt spiral.
Sunny says it carried out affordability and creditworthiness checks  before approving  each of 
the loans. It says that it did not approve all of Mr Os loan requests which shows each 
application was assessed individually. It says there  was no evidence that Mr O was in 
financial hardship whilst he was borrowing. Nevertheless it agreed to uphold  loan 1.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She considered Mr Os 
pattern of borrowing from loan 5 onwards  suggested  he had become reliant on short-term  
loans. She recommended  that Sunny should  refund interest and charges on loans  5 to 19 
(plus 8% statutory interest) in addition to loan 1 on which Sunny had already made  an offer.  
Our adjudicator also said all entries  about loans 5 onwards should  be removed from Mr Os 
credit file.
Ref: DRN47096162Sunny responded to say, in summary,  that its checks showed all the loans to be affordable 
to Mr O and that he did not demonstrate an over-reliance on the lending. It added  there  were  
significant breaks in lending  between  loans 4 and 5 and loans  7 and 8 and that Mr Os 
repayment history was good.
my provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Sunny and to Mr O on 8 October  2019.  I summarise my 
findings here:
As Sunny had already  offered  to uphold Mr Os complaint about loan 1, I didnt 
consider it further;
Loans 2 to 4 were  taken out during, or shortly after loan 1. As loan 1 was a running 
account, and unsuitable for borrowing over long periods,  I found  the approval  of 
loans 2 to 4 had the same effect  as unfairly allowing Mr O to continue to draw down 
on the running account credit. So I considered Sunny should have seen that it was 
unlikely Mr O would have  been  able to sustainably repay those loans;
Because of the gap in lending between loans 4 and 5 I didnt find it unreasonable  for 
Sunny to have  considered Mr O was not reliant  on short-term lending  at this stage. I 
was satisfied that the checks carried  out at the time indicated the repayments were  
affordable to Mr O so didnt find Sunny did anything  wrong by approving loans 5 to 7;
Mr O had a further 19-month break between loans 7 and 8. Because  of this I couldnt 
say Mr O was reliant on the borrowing and I found  the checks  carried  out by Sunny 
showed nothing  to indicate  loans  8 to 12 were unaffordable to him;
When I looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending  history with Mr O, I 
considered Sunny  should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable by loan 13 because:
oIt was Mr Os sixth loan application in just two months;
oFrom  loan 13 onwards  Mr O was provided  with a new loan within  days/weeks 
of a previous one. So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more likely  than not 
Mr O was having to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his previous 
loan was leaving in his finances  and that Mr Os indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably;
oMr O wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  19 
was taken out 9 months after loan 8 (the first in the chain)  and it was for twice  
the amount.  Mr O had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period.
So my provisional decision was to uphold the complaint about loans 2 to 4, and 13 to 19 (as 
well as loan 1, on which Sunny had already made an offer). I said it should refund interest 
and charges (plus  8% statutory interest) on these loans, remove  adverse information about 
loans 1 to 4 from Mr Os credit file, and remove loans  13 to 19 in their entirety.
Mr O did not respond to the provisional  decision.
Sunny responded to say, in summary,  that:
It now did not agree to uphold Mr Os complaint  regarding loan 1 and was satisfied 
this loan was affordable  to him and was not used  in a way which  was unsuitable;
There was almost  three months  between Mr Os last drawdown on loan 1 and 
applying for loan 2 and almost  two months between loans  2 and 3. It added that there 
was a further break in borrowing between loans 16 and 17;
Ref: DRN47096163Mr O borrowed  small amounts in comparison with his income and had sufficient 
disposable income to make the repayments;
The number of loans,  in itself, does not automatically mean its checks will not be 
proportionate as all its checks  are comprehensive;
Mr O had a good  repayment history. There was no evidence  to show Mr O was using 
the loans to refinance previous loans  and it could not agree that Mr O continued to 
borrow to cover a hole in his finances;
Mr O did not indicate  he was in financial difficulties;
There is no evidence that the Sunny loans on Mr Os credit file meant  he was 
declined for mainstream credit.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have now reviewed loan 1 in light of Sunnys changed decision and have  found  that 
Sunnys affordability  analysis shows expenditure exceeding  income at the time of this loan 
application. As Sunny has not provided  any information that supersedes this, I have to 
conclude that loan 1 was unaffordable to Mr O and, therefore, should  not have been 
approved.
I will also address each  of Sunnys other  additional points in turn:
I cannot accept  that the gap between the last drawdown on loan 1 and the loan 2 
application constitutes a break in borrowing when  loan 1 was still outstanding at the 
time. And although there  is a seven-week gap between loans 2 and 3, I dont 
consider it reasonable for Sunny  to view that as no longer  being reliant on the lending 
when Mr O had been in debt to it for more than 8 months before that. Similarly the 
two-month break  in borrowing after loan 16 came  after seven months  of continuous 
loans;
I accept Mr Os loans were  small in comparison to his declared income and the 
repayments appeared affordable.  But Ive seen no evidence  to show  that Sunny 
carried out the full financial reviews that would have  been  proportionate given the 
number and frequency of loans;
Even though  Sunny  says its checks were  comprehensive, I cant see that it asked 
Mr O whether he had any other  short-term  loans, or indeed,  whether it verified the 
expenditure information hed provided;
Although Mr O had a good  repayment history, many of the repayments were  made  
shortly before or after he applied  for additional loans;
I accept Mr O did not tell Sunny that he was in financial difficulties, but his borrowing 
pattern in itself suggested he was not using the loans for their intended purpose. That 
is, Mr O was not using the high-cost loans to address short-term cash flow issues;
I also accept there  is no evidence that Mr O has been declined  for mainstream  credit  
as a result of his credit file, but such  a high number of loans on his file could only be 
perceived as having  a negative impact. As I find the majority  of these loans should 
never have been approved, I consider it fair that Mr Os credit file should be amended  
accordingly.
In summary,  I cannot conclude that Sunny has provided any significant  additional  
information and, as such, I see no reason to depart  from my provisional decision.
Ref: DRN47096164my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading  as 
Sunny) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr O paid on loans 1 to 4 and loans 13 to 19;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loans 1 to 4 from Mr Os credit file;
The number of loans  taken from loan 13 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 13 to 19 should be removed from 
Mr Os credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2020.
