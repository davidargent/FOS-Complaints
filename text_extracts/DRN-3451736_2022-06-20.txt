The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA reversed a payment hed received 
through his account and used debt collectors to chase him for repayment.
What happened
Mr B sold a phone and received a payment for it through his PayPal account. However, the 
buyer raised a dispute through PayPals buyer protection policy, saying the phone was 
blacklisted and unusable.
PayPal gathered evidence. Mr B contacted the mobile network, who told him the blacklist 
had been in error and removed it. But PayPal found in favour of the buyer. They deducted 
the payment from Mr Bs account, leaving a negative balance. They also asked him to repay 
the amount the account was in deficit and blocked his PayPal account. Mr B raised a 
complaint, and PayPal responded saying they hadnt received evidence theyd asked for 
from Mr B.
Unhappy with this answer Mr B referred the complaint to our service. He said he understood 
PayPals original decision to refund the customer, but once hed provided proof the blacklist 
was in error, they should have reversed the decision. 
He said hed contacted the buyer, whod confirmed the phone now worked, but refused to 
resend the payment. He also said that being asked to repay the debt by PayPal, and third 
party agencies on their behalf, caused him a lot of stress and anxiety.
One of our investigators looked into what happened  and after consideration PayPal agreed 
to refund the amount in dispute and unblock his PayPal account. They also agreed to pay 
Mr B £50 compensation for what happened. Our investigator felt this was a fair outcome.
Mr B disagreed, saying that he wouldnt accept the £50 compensation. He said the situation 
had had a great impact on his mental health. He said there had been an impact on his credit 
score, and he has credit cards and broadband rejected because of the debt recovery 
attempts. He wanted reassurance that what happened to him wouldnt happen to anyone 
else. 
As no agreement could be reached the case has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im satisfied the offer PayPal have made is fair.
Firstly, Im glad PayPal have agreed to clear the outstanding balance. Im satisfied this is the 
fairest thing to do in the circumstances.
Turning to the compensation on offer, there are several factors for me to take in to account. 
From what Mr B has told us, it does seem that when he first sold the phone, it was 
blacklisted. So, the buyer would have a legitimate dispute here. This doesnt stem from 
anything Mr B has done, but likewise it wasnt an issue PayPal had initially caused. 
Likewise, when Mr B succeeded in getting the mobile network to remove the blacklist and 
the phone became usable, it would seem sensible for the buyer to either withdraw the 
dispute with PayPal or make the payment again. That they didnt was no doubt distressing 
for Mr B. But this isnt something I can hold PayPal liable for, its down to the actions of the 
buyer.
But I think PayPal could have handled the situation better. I accept what Mr B has said about 
having difficulty in contacting them. I also think once they received the information that the 
blacklist was removed, they could have re-reviewed their decision. This also likely would 
have prevented any need for Mr B to be asked to repay the debt  although this was only for 
a limited period, and I cant see that any money was collected from Mr P. But Im satisfied 
that PayPal were unreasonable in how they tried to help Mr P, and that its fair to ask them to 
pay compensation. 
Mr B has commented on the impact on his credit file. But Ive not been provided with any 
evidence that this debt was reported with external credit reference agencies. So, Im not 
satisfied there was any impact on Mr Ps ability to obtain credit. 
I thought carefully about what Mr B has said about the length of time it took to resolve, and 
how much time he had to put in to do so. Hes mentioned his hourly rate for the time taken to 
attempt to discuss this with PayPal, but this isnt something Im satisfied they should pay. Mr 
P hasnt suggested that hes suffered actual financial loss  for example, that hes been 
unable to work at all because of this complaint. 
Rather, hes attached a value to the time he couldve have spent working overtime instead of 
dealing with the complaint. In those circumstances, I dont think an hourly rate is appropriate 
because theres no guarantee this is money that would have been earned, except for the 
actions of PayPal. 
The appropriate way to decide compensation for his upset and inconvenience caused by 
PayPal is to look at what happened as a whole. In doing so, Ive taken account of the overall 
impact this matter has had on Mr P, what impact can be directly attributed to PayPal and not 
a third party, and more broadly in the context of the sorts of awards made by our service in 
cases similar to this.
Ive no doubt this was a stressful and difficult experience for Mr P, and Im sorry to hear of 
the difficulties he had. But as Ive explained above, I cant say PayPal are solely responsible 
for everything that went caused this distress. On that basis Im satisfied that the £50 on offer 
is a fair reflection of the impact of PayPals actions.
My final decision
My final decision is that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must:
Clear the remaining balance of Mr Bs PayPal account, and ensure they are not 
asking him to repay anything related to this transaction
Pay him £50 for the distress and inconvenience causedUnder the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 July 2022.
