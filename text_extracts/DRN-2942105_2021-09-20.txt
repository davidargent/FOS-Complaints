The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) added Q markers to his 
credit report.
What happened
Mr S held a PayPal credit account that he used to make purchases. In November 2017 and 
April 2020 he raised a dispute with the merchant as he hadnt received the goods he had 
paid for using PayPal credit. 
Mr S said the merchant informed PayPal and PayPal then added a Q marker on his credit 
file for the relevant months the transactions were disputed to indicate a query had been 
raised. When Mr S became aware of this, he asked PayPal to remove the markers. He was 
concerned the markers were seen negatively and had affected his ability to re-mortgage. He 
was also unhappy as he felt for the months the Q markers had been added, the credit 
report didnt show he had maintained the required payments and feels it should reflect this 
by indicating the account was up to date.
PayPal said they had an obligation to report how Mr S ran his credit account and that they 
felt the markers were an accurate reflection of this. So, they werent going to remove them.
Mr S referred his concerns to our service. Our investigator didnt feel PayPal had done 
anything wrong in applying the markers. Mr S remained unhappy, he said PayPal hadnt 
reported the payment status of his account for the months in question and he had reported 
the disputes to the merchant and not PayPal. Hes asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having considered everything, I'm not upholding Mr S' complaint. I know this isn't the 
outcome hed hoped for, but I'll explain my reasoning below.
A credit reference agency has explained a Q status means theres a query raised about the 
account information. As Mr S did query two transactions he made using PayPal credit, it 
doesnt seem unreasonable for PayPal to record a Q for the months in question as the 
balance was in effect in question as the goods werent received. PayPal also refunded the 
money so they would also have needed to amend the account information.
Whilst Mr S may have reported the dispute to the merchant, PayPal have provided 
information that shows the disputes were reported to them directly. But regardless of how it 
was reported PayPal terms and conditions says: 
If you dispute any Transaction, you must tell us about this as soon as possible.
So, Mr S was bound by the terms to report the disputes to PayPal. This isnt unreasonable 
given that PayPal may have to refund any disputed transaction. 
Mr S has confirmed he disputed two purchases in November 2017 and April 2020 as he 
hadnt received goods he had paid for. PayPal have confirmed these are the disputes 
recorded as Q on Mr S credit report.
In the terms and conditions PayPal explained they would report how Mr S managed his 
account to credit reference agencies. And as Mr S did query purchases at these times, and 
the information is therefore accurate, I cant say PayPal has recorded this unfairly. PayPal 
have explained their internal process for when a dispute is raised with them, and from the 
information theyve provided, I can see they have followed their process as they would with 
any other customer that reports a dispute to them.
I understand Mr S point that the report should reflect that he made the required payments 
for the relevant months. However, I dont think the Q marker suggests Mr S hasnt made the 
required payment. The report also shows details of the statement balance and payments 
made in 2019 and 2020 and I can see a payment was made in April 2020. PayPal have 
therefore accurately reflected this as there was a query on the account and a payment made 
in April 2020. 
The report doesnt show payments made in 2017 as it doesnt go into that level of detail for 
previous years. However, its likely lenders would put more weight on recent payment history 
when making lending decisions. And Im satisfied the Q marker doesnt mean a payment 
wasnt made.
Mr S has said he feels the markers have had an adverse effect on him re-mortgaging. I dont 
know why Mr S was initially turned down when trying to re-mortgage and I havent seen any 
evidence to suggest he was turned down because of the Q markers. When deciding if to 
lend/provide credit there are various factors considered and lenders individually have their 
own lending criteria. So where one lender might decline an application another might accept. 
However, I can understand Mr S concern about possible future checks on his credit report 
particularly in relation to his employment.
My role here is to decide if PayPal have been fair in applying the Q marker and as PayPals 
explanation of why it was added does relate to queries made about purchases using PayPal 
credit at those times, I cant say theyve been unfair here.
Where there is a concern about something reported on a credit report, the individual can 
request a notice of correction is added. This is a short explanatory note which explains to 
prospective creditors why certain information is on their file. Mr S may want to explore this 
further with the credit reference agency to see of this is something that would be useful to 
him.
Mr S has also raised concerns that his data protection rights may have been breached. It 
seems to me that the concerns may be primarily about the merchant as he has told us he is 
concerned about the merchant disclosing the information to PayPal, so this would be 
something Mr S would need to refer to the merchant. My final decision
For reasons I have explained above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 October 2021.
