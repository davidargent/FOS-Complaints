Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ks complaint and thought the loans from 6 July 2021 
onwards shouldnt have been given. Morses disagreed and the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Morses is aware of it obligations as a lender as explained in the regulators handbook so I 
dont intend to go into all the details about his duty. In summary, Morses is required to take 
reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. There isnt a prescriptive level of 
checks to ensure responsible lending and in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think 
less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Morses should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ks complaint. Having done so, I dont think Morses 
was wrong to lend loans 1  3 but it shouldnt have lent loans 4 and 5, Ill explain why.
Loans 1  3 were lent during the early stages of the lending relationship. The loan 
repayments were modest compared to Mr Ks income and there wasnt anything from the 
credit search or his lending history that I think should have prompted Morses to take its 
checks further. The checks Morses carried out for all three loans suggest Mr K could afford 
the repayments, so I dont think Morses was wrong to lend.
However, by loan 4, I dont think it was reasonable for Morses to continue to rely on the level 
of checks it used for the previous loans. Mr had borrowed loans 3 and 4 on the same day he 
repaid loans 1 and 2. Mr K also took out loan 5 (the highest loan amount) on the same day 
he repaid loan 3 and hadnt had a break in lending. Mr K had been repaying more than one 
loan at a time from the start of the borrowing relationship. I think given the above, Morses 
should have been looking to understand a bit more about Mr Ks finances before agreeing to 
lend loans 4 and 5.
To understand more about Mr Ks finances at the time, Ive looked at his credit file from 
around that time and from what I can see, Mr had a default less than a month before loan 4 
was granted, he was also repaying at least three other high-cost credit accounts. Also, Mr K 
had historic defaults on his account which didnt appear to be reducing in balance and so 
wasnt freeing himself from debt. I dont think Mr Ks circumstances improved by loan 5 
either.
I appreciate different checks may show different things, but I think its reasonable to rely on 
Mr Ks credit file in this instance to understand his financial position at the time, given the 
absence of other evidence/information from Morses. Morses believes its checks showed 
Mr K could afford the loan repayments, while that was the suggestion its checks showed, 
Mr Ks lending history with Morses should have prompted further checks and had Morses 
carried out further checks, I think it would likely have found Mr K was struggling financially 
and wouldnt have lent loans 4 and 5.
Morses has lent when it shouldnt have, and it needs to put things right.
Putting things right  what Morses needs to do;
remove all interest, fees and charges added to loans 4 and 5. Add up the total 
amount of money Mr K received as a result of having been given loans 4 and 5. The 
repayments Mr K made should be deducted from this amount. 
a) If this results in Mr K having paid more than they received, any overpayments 
should be refunded along with 8% simple interest (calculated from the date the 
overpayments were made until the date of settlement). 
b) If any capital balance remains outstanding, then Morses should attempt to arrange 
an affordable and suitable payment plan with Mr K.remove any negative information about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Ks credit file once the 
capital has been fully repaid.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Morses to take off tax from this interest. Morses must give Mr K a 
certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ks complaint. Morses Club PLC 
should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 June 2023.
