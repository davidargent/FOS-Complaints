The complaint
Mr M is unhappy that NewDay Ltd would not provide a refund for a purchase he made using 
his credit card.
What happened
In June 2021, Mr M made a purchase using his credit card account with NewDay. The item 
that Mr M bought was a mobile telephone handset from an online supplier. The supplier had 
advertised the handset through an online shopping website, who Ill call X. 
The handset was delivered to Mr M a few days after the purchase. But, once Mr M tried to 
switch the handset on, he says he found it to be faulty. So, Mr M contacted NewDay to see 
what could be done.
NewDay say that they sent Mr M some paperwork to start a chargeback claim. In the 
meantime, Mr M sent the handset back to the supplier, using the address he found on the 
suppliers website. NewDay then received the paperwork back from Mr M and credited his 
credit card account with the amount he had paid to the supplier. Mr M also received 
conformation from the supplier that they had received the handset and had processed a 
refund through X.
NewDay say X went on to defend the chargeback and said Mr M hadnt yet sent the handset 
back to the supplier. In light of Xs stance, NewDay debited Mr Ms credit card account for 
the cost of the handset.
Mr M complained to NewDay and said they should still uphold his chargeback claim, as he 
had proven he had sent the handset back to the supplier. NewDay responded to say that X 
had defended the chargeback and that Mr M hadnt provided enough evidence to show hed 
returned the handset. Mr M didnt accept NewDays response and brought his complaint to 
us.
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ms case and found that NewDay hadnt treated 
Mr M fairly. He said Mr M had shown that he used the correct address on a receipt from the 
Post Office. The investigator concluded that NewDay should have engaged further with 
Mr M, when he first raised the chargeback with them. He said NewDay should refund the 
cost of the handset to Mr M.
Mr M accepted the investigators findings, but NewDay didnt. They said Mr M should have 
provided more information when he raised his claim. They also said that once the 
chargeback was defended by X, they had to stop the claim.
The investigator didnt change his conclusions and so Mr Ms complaint has been passed to 
me to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr M used his credit card account with NewDay to pay the supplier for the mobile telephone 
handset through Xs website. NewDay is a member of a card network which provides card 
services. And this network has rules which includes giving NewDay an avenue for card 
transactions to be disputed with merchants through the chargeback process.
In certain circumstances, when a cardholder has a dispute about a transaction, as Mr M 
does here, NewDay, as the card issuer, can attempt to go through the chargeback process. 
This isnt a right for consumers and firms arent obliged to raise a chargeback. However it is 
clearly good practice for firms to raise a chargeback when the firm feels they have a 
reasonable prospect of success of recovering funds for their customer. 
Mr Ms card is a Mastercard credit card and so the operation of the chargeback would be 
under the Mastercard chargeback rules. 
The rule NewDay used to start the chargeback claim was for goods that are defective or not 
as described. I can see from the Mastercard rules that Mr M was required to provide various 
supporting documents for his claim. Namely emails, letters or messages which makes it 
clear for all parties in the dispute to understand what has happened. 
NewDay also asked Mr M to complete a form, which asked for the dates the goods were 
returned to the supplier and received by them. Additionally, Mr M was asked to provide proof 
from the Post Office, including the reference number used for tracking the item. I can see 
that Mr M provided all the details NewDay had asked for, plus evidence that his account with 
X had been suspended.
Within their response to Mr Ms complaint, NewDay say that Mr M failed to send them details 
of where he got the return address from. But, having looked at the Mastercard chargeback 
guidance and NewDays own request for information, I cannot see that Mr M was prompted 
to provide those details. And I dont think it would have been necessarily obvious to him that 
he needed to show where he found the returns address.
Having considered everything, I think Mr M sent all the details which NewDay needed to 
show X, that he had returned the handset to the supplier. I think NewDay had an opportunity 
to ask Mr M for further details about the returns address, if they felt what theyd asked for on 
the chargeback form wasnt enough. So, I dont think NewDay treated Mr Ms chargeback 
claim fairly here.
X responded to the chargeback claim to say that Mr M hadnt returned the item. But, Ive 
concluded that Mr M had sent NewDay sufficient information, to show that he had returned 
the handset to the supplier. He did this using a service where the receiver had to sign for the 
delivery. Overall, Im persuaded that this contradicting information should have prompted 
NewDays disputes team to ask further questions.
I can see from the further evidence Mr M had at the time, that the supplier sent him an email 
to confirm receipt of the handset and that they had sent a refund to X. NewDay didnt look 
into things further at this point, despite having evidence to support Mr Ms claim that he had 
returned the handset.
I think that in order to defend a claim of this type, the supplier or X, would have needed to 
respond with evidence that they had provided the goods that they had been paid for. Or, that 
Mr M hadnt returned the goods.
But, I dont think the evidence from the supplier of the handset shows that Mr M still had the item. I think all the evidence shows that what X said to NewDay, was incorrect. So, I dont 
think NewDay treated Mr M fairly when they accepted Xs response to the chargeback. 
All things considered, I think a chargeback right did exist for Mr M and NewDay should have 
continued with the chargeback process after receiving the Xs defence. And had they done 
so I think the chargeback would have ultimately succeeded had it been pursued robustly by 
NewDay. So, I think NewDay has acted unfairly by depriving Mr M of the opportunity to 
recover his funds.
In all the circumstances, I think its fair for NewDay to refund the cost of the handset to 
Mr Ms credit card account.
Putting things right
For these reasons NewDay Ltd should credit Mr Ms account with Â£54.96, being the cost of 
the handset in the transaction to the online supplier.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and require NewDay Ltd to put things right as 
set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2023.
