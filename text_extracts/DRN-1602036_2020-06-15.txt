The complaint
Mr W complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) was 
irresponsible in its lending to him.
What happened
Mr W's complaint is about the 19 instalment loans provided to him by Sunny 
between October 2015 and February 2017. Mr W's borrowing history with Sunny is set out

DRN-1602036The loans were repayable over weekly instalments. Mr W said that Sunny should have 
realised that the loans weren't affordable and that he had to borrow more to make his 
repayments. He said that the loans resulted in him becoming trapped in a spiral of debt.
Sunny said that before the loans were provided it carried out eligibility, creditworthiness and 
affordability checks. It said that it gathered information from Mr W about his income and 
expenses and it also used information from the credit reference agencies to ensure that the 
amounts it had lent could be repaid without any undue difficulties.
In its final response letter dated September 2019, Sunny said that it could have been 
prudent to make contact when Mr W had been borrowing for 18 months. Because of this it 
upheld his complaint from loan 16. Sunny also wrote off Mr W's last two loans in September 
2019.
Our adjudicator didn't uphold the first six loans but thought that by loan 7, Mr W's borrowing 
showed a pattern that suggested he was persistently reliant on the loans. Because of this 
they upheld this complaint from loan 7 onwards.
Sunny provided a counter offer in response to our adjudicator's view. It offered to uphold 
loans 11 onwards.
Mr W didn't accept Sunny's offer and so this complaint has been passed to me, an 
ombudsman, to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
We've set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr Wcould 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and the 
consumer's income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could sustainably repay his loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having 
to borrow to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly 
and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments 
sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ws complaint.
Our adjudicator didn't uphold the first six loans. As neither party has disputed this I haven't 
considered these individual loans any further. I have however included them in my overall 
assessment of Mr W's borrowing.
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr W, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ws case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 7.
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr W was not managing to repay his 
loans sustainably. Mr W had taken out seven loans within six months  at times 
overlapping with existing loans. Loan 7 was taken out on the same day that Mr W repaid 
loans 4, 5 and 6. I think this should have raised concerns Mr W was not able to sustainably 
repay his loans and that following the repayments he needed to borrow again to replace the 
repaid funds. 
Mr Ws total amount of indebtedness wasn't decreasing in any significant way and I think 
that Sunny ought to have known that Mr W was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need.
Mr W continued to borrow from Sunny over the following months taking out overlapping 
loans and new loans shortly after repaying previous debt suggesting that his pattern of 
dependency continued.
I think lending from loan 7 had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ws indebtedness by 
allowing him to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time. I also find that the number of loans Mr W borrowed was likely to have had negative 
implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
Because of the above, Im upholding this complaint about loans 7 onwards.
 
 Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 7 to 16 along with 8% simple
interest a year from the date of payment to the date of settlement*;
Sunny said in its final response letter that loans 18 and 19 had been sold to a third
party and that it would contact the debt purchaser and arrange for any outstanding
balances to be written off. In regard to these loans all interest and charges should be
waived and all payments made by Mr W should be considered as payments towards
the capital amount. If this still leaves a capital balance outstanding then Sunny
should, as it offered in its final response letter, take action for these balances to be
written off. In the event Mr W had made further payments to these loans and the total
amount he paid was higher than the capital amount borrowed, any overpayment
should be refunded to him along with 8% simple interest a year from the date of the
overpayment arose to the date of settlement*;
the number of loans taken from loan 7 means any information recorded about them is
adverse. So, all entries about loans 7 to 19 should be removed from Mr Ws credit
file.
I find it reasonable that any capital balance write off in regard to the loans above is offset 
against the total amount refunded to Mr W.  
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr W a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold Mr W's complaint and Elevate Credit International 
Limited should put things right as detailed above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2020.
