Mr W has said lending  was provided  with no suitable  affordability  checks.  Sunny  has said its 
checks were proportionate and responsible. 
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Ws complaint in part and thought loans 5 to 8 shouldnt have 
been given. Sunny didnt  agree in full  it made an offer for loans 7 and 8. The complaint has 
now been passed to me to decide. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr W could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN58977432the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments.
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Mr W hasnt disagreed with our adjudicators opinion on loans 1 to 4 so I wont  be looking at 
these any further  as there is no ongoing  disagreement about  them.  But I will bear them in 
mind when Im looking at Mr Ws other  lending. 
A proportionate  check for loan 5 would  most  likely have shown that Mr W was having trouble 
in managing his money. I say this because  by this stage, Mr W had a history  of taking out 
further loans for relatively high amounts, not too long after repaying  previous ones. And 
some of them were even provided  when Mr W already had an outstanding balance  on an 
existing loan. By the time loan 5 was taken out, Mr W had only repaid one of his previous  
loans. So it was clear  from this that Mr W wasnt using these high-cost loans to deal with a 
short-term cashflow problem. So, in these circumstances, Sunny ought to have  realised it 
was unlikely Mr W wouldve been able to sustainably  repay  loan 5  and any subsequent 
loans. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr W, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Having looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr W, I think  that Sunny 
should reasonably have  seen that Mr W was unlikely to have been able to make his 
payments in a sustainable manner by the time it provided loan 6. Im not persuaded that the 
loan repayments  being less than a certain percentage of Mr Ws income or the fact that      
Mr W didnt say that he was having  financial difficulty means that these loans were  
sustainable.
Ref: DRN58977433Sunny continued  lending  to Mr W even when  this pattern was repeated and in circumstances 
where it ought reasonably to have realised  that any further loans were more likely than not 
unsustainable for him. 
Mr W had to pay interest and charges on loans that Sunny shouldnt have provided him with. 
So I think that he lost out and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on 5 to 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loan 5 from Mr Ws credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 8 should be removed from      
Mr Ws credit file.
If Mr W still owes Sunny any of the principal balance  he borrowed on his final loan
Sunny should  remove all the interest  and charges applied to the outstanding balance.
Sunny should  then re-work the account as if all payments made  by Mr W went to towards
the principal. But importantly, Sunny needs  to make sure that Mr W doesnt  repay  more
than the principal amount borrowed.
If after doing this Mr W hasnt repaid the principal he borrowed  Sunny can deduct this
from the remainder of the compensation.  If, Mr W has already paid enough to repay  the
principal then any overpayment should be refunded to him with 8% simple interest from the
date of payment  to the date of settlement.
And if Sunny no longer  owns this debt, and it wants to make a deduction  due to the
amount owed, then it should buy it back.  If it doesnt  then it isnt entitled to make  any
deductions for it from the amount it needs to pay Mr W.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr W a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN58977434my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ws complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 April 2020.
