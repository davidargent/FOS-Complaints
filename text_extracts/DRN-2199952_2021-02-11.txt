The complaint
Miss C complains about the customer service that she received from Shop Direct Finance 
Company Limited, trading as very, relating to her order of a wardrobe.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Miss C used her credit account with Shop Direct to buy a wardrobe in November 
2019 but, when it was delivered, it was damaged so she contacted Shop Direct and it 
sent her a replacement wardrobe;
the collection of the damaged wardrobe didnt take place at the arranged time which 
caused Miss C further distress and inconvenience so she complained to Shop Direct 
and it offered to reduce the cost of the wardrobe by £50 and to pay £30 to Miss C 
because shed been misadvised about the collection and then had to write to it;
Miss C didnt accept that offer and complained to this service - she says that Shop 
Direct should refund the cost of the wardrobe as compensation for its extremely poor 
customer service;
our investigator said that Shop Direct had acted in-line with its complaint process and 
she couldnt say that it had done anything wrong in its handling of Miss Cs complaint 
 she was satisfied that no charges were applied in respect of the replacement 
wardrobe and she said that the compensation offered by Shop Direct was in-line with 
what she would have recommended;
Miss C says that Shop Directs complaints process is designed to prevent customers 
from being able to easily discuss problems they are having with its customer service 
team and she hasnt had a satisfactory resolution for the amount of time spent 
resolving her complaint and the inconvenience to her;
theres no dispute that there have been some issues with the customer service that 
Miss C has received - the wardrobe was damaged when it was delivered to her and 
she was mis-advised about the collection of the damaged wardrobe  which caused 
her inconvenience;
Miss C has described in detail the issues that shes had with Shop Directs customer 
service and the distress and inconvenience that shes been caused  and I 
sympathise with her for the difficulties that shes experienced  but I consider that the 
compensation totalling £80 that Shop Direct has offered to her is fair and reasonable 
compensation for that distress and inconvenience;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Miss C has been 
charged more for the wardrobe than the price that she agreed to pay for it or that 
interest has been applied to her account incorrectly;
I consider that Shop Directs response to Miss Cs complaint has been fair and 
reasonable and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these 
circumstances for me to require it to refund the cost of the wardrobe to Miss C as 
compensation for the issues that shes experienced, to pay her a higher amount of 
compensation than its already offered her or to take any other action in response to 
her complaint; and
I find that Shop Direct should credit to Miss Cs account the £80 that its offered to 
her (if it hasnt already done so).
My final decision
My decision is that Shop Direct Finance Company Limited should credit to Miss Cs account 
the £80 compensation that its offered to her (if it hasnt already done so).
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 March 2021.
