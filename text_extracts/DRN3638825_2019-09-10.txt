K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA carried  out a credit  search on his credit  
file for a fraudulent application.
background
Mr B says PayPal carried out a credit search  in July 2018 but he didnt apply for credit with it. 
He says the application was fraudulent  and would like PayPal to remove details from his 
credit file and make  a gesture of goodwill  payment to him.
PayPal says it couldnt find any suspicious activity on Mr Bs account  but says a different IP 
address was used  on the day of the credit application. It says thats  not unusual  as Mr B had 
previously accessed  his account from the same location as the disputed  application.  PayPal 
says it cant remove details of the credit  search  from Mr Bs credit  file and has to be disputed  
by Mr B. It also says Mr B is responsible for keeping his password  safe.
Mr B brought his complaint to us and our adjudicator  didnt uphold  it. The adjudicator thought  
that PayPal could remove the information from Mr Bs credit file but didnt think there  was 
any evidence of unauthorised access to Mr Bs account. In those circumstances  the 
adjudicator thought PayPal had acted fairly by recording the application as a search  rather  
than a declined  credit application.
Mr B doesnt  accept that view and would like to know  what  was recorded on his credit file 
and if that affected  his credit score. He says PayPal  didnt  provide him with a final response 
letter and it wouldnt tell him anything about  what may have happened  or treated him fairly.
I asked both sides for further information.  In summary I asked PayPal why it couldnt remove  
details of the search from Mr Bs credit file and if the IP address was used again.  I asked  Mr 
B if he had reported  the fraud  to the police and if hes asked the Credit  Reference Agencies 
(CRAs) to remove the information.
PayPal says it believed  the complaint had been  resolved by cancelling  the credit  application  
and it maintains it cant remove the information from the credit file. It says the IP address 
wasnt used again.
Mr B says hes not reported  the fraud to the police and that hes asked the CRAs to remove  
the information but they say PayPal  must  request it.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the overall 
view that I dont require  PayPal to pay Mr B the compensation he would like for the reasons I 
will explain.  But I think it should  consider asking the CRAs to remove  the search  details from 
Mr Bs credit  file if that information still appears  on his credit file.
I asked both sides for further information  about  the credit application in order to decide if Mr 
B had made it or if it was a fraudulent  application. I appreciate that PayPal says it could not 
find any suspicious circumstances and that Mr Bs details had been correctly  used. And I can 
see that Mr B says he was the victim of fraud  at that time. So Ive come to the overall  view 
that on balance  I cant be sure Mr B made the application. And I can also see that the IP 
address used for the application  wasnt used again  and wasnt from Mr Bs home  address.
Ref: DRN36388252So I think PayPal should treat this application as fraudulent. In those circumstances I would 
expect PayPal to tell the CRAs that and ask them  to remove the details from Mr Bs credit 
file. I appreciate PayPal  says it cant do so and that its up to Mr B to make  that request. But 
whilst Im sorry to disagree with PayPal I can see no reason why it cant tell the CRAs that 
and I can see that the CRAs  have  told Mr B that its up to PayPal to make  that request. Im 
also satisfied that approach  is in line with the Information Commissioners Office(ICO) 
guidance and I have no doubt  Mr B will raise this issue with it if PayPal maintain its position.
I appreciate that Mr B also complains about how PayPal dealt with his complaint and that it 
didnt provide him with a final response  letter. Ive looked at this part of Mr Bs complaint and 
I think on balance PayPal  tried to assist Mr B by cancelling the credit application. I also think  
PayPal thought by doing so it had dealt with Mr Bs complaint. I accept  that in those  
circumstances PayPal  could have sent Mr B a final response letter when it became clear that 
Mr B felt his complaint  hadnt been addressed.  But I dont think Mr B suffered  any financial 
loss as a result of what took place and I dont  think the way in which  PayPal dealt with Mr Bs 
complaint justifies any compensation.
Overall I accept there are many unanswered questions here. And I hope  PayPal  will 
consider removing the search details from Mr Bs credit file even though  I think it unlikely the 
search will have had any affect on his credit  score.  And I think  it likely  that the credit search 
will have dropped off Mr Bs credit file by now in any event. For that reason I dont  intend  to 
order PayPal to remove the search  details.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 October  2019
