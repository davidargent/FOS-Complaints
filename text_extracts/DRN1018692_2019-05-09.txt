K821x#15complaint
Mr M complains that hes lost out financially  because in 2009, Aviva  Life and Pensions 
UK Limited  failed to update four of his five pension policies with his new address.
background
Mr M wrote to Aviva in 2009 to say he had moved  house. He had five pension  policies 
with Aviva.  Aviva only updated his address on one the policies  the policy  ending  5546. 
It wasnt until 2015, that Aviva updated  its records for policies ending 2387, 1381, 8589  
and 2375.
Aviva says that it wrote to his pension adviser about  account ending 2387, in May 2011, as
Mr M was coming up to NRA. It says his adviser shouldve passed  this on.
Mr M reached normal retirement age (NRA)  in 2011. His 5546  pension pot was worth around
£30,000. He took a 25% tax free lump sum and an annuity.
In 2015, Aviva wrote to Mr M thanking him for providing his new address. Mr M queried  
why hed been sent this. Aviva later explained  that it had failed to update all his policies in 
2009. It said this had recently come to light. 
Mr M said he thought his other policies had been rolled up into 5546, the policy  hed put 
into payment in 2011.
By the time Mr M was able to take his other retirement benefits, the law had changed.  
Mr M was able to take three  of his policies as a cash lump sum (2387, 1381 and 8589). 
This option wasnt available to him back in 2011. The fourth policy 2375, was a defined 
benefit pension  plan. In 2017, Mr M took a defined benefit cash sum and an annuity.
Aviva considered Mr Ms complaint. After completing a loss calculation it said that hed 
not lost out financially. But, it paid Mr M £250  for the inconvenience caused.
Mr M brought his complaint to our service.  Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ms complaint. 
She thought  that Mr M may have  lost out financially and asked Aviva to carry out a loss 
calculation based  on him taking three of his pensions in the same way as hed taken 
policy ending 5546 in 2011. She thought it not unreasonable to proceed on this basis, 
given that Mr M had chosen to proceed in this way in 2011, and the option he took in 
2016, wasnt available to him back then.  She also recommended a way to calculate the 
loss in relation  to his defined benefit policy.
Aviva didnt agree with our adjudicators settlement proposal.  Aviva said,  in summary:
 Mr Ms adviser shouldve passed on the information about  account 2387 in May
2011, so it shouldnt be responsible for any loss in respect of this policy.
 In relation to plans 8589 and 1381,  it says whilst it may not have been Mr Ms 
original intention to take his benefits after his NRA, he benefitted from a greater 
range of options being available  to him and fund growth. It says Mr M wasnt 
interested in taking  an annuity,  he wanted  to cash in these policies and this 
Ref: DRN10186922shouldnt be overlooked. It says it would  therefore  be unfair to require the business  
to calculate  the loss in the way proposed by the adjudicator.
 For account 2375, it says it would be fair to re-calculate  Mr Ms benefits as if 
theyd been taken at his NRA.  It says it could rewrite  the annuity,  but this would 
mean that Mr Ms monthly payment would reduce  and he would lose the five year 
guarantee period as this wouldve expired in 2016.
I issued my provisional decision on Mr Ms complaint in April 2019. I said I was minded to 
uphold it and to require Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited to pay Mr M redress  as set out in 
my provisional decision. The order I proposed to make for redress  was different from our 
adjudicators, so I invited  both parties  to let me have  any further  comments  they wanted me 
to consider before I issued my final decision.
Mr Ms response to my provisional decision
Mr M said that he wasnt previously aware  of Aviva  saying it had written to his pension 
adviser about his plan 2387, in 2011. He questioned why the correspondence wasnt also 
copied to him.
He said that when he took his annuity  in respect  of plan 5546, he opted for an open  market 
option, taking  a 25% lump sum and moving  the balance to another provider before taking an 
annuity. This was because the other provider offered a higher annuity than Aviva. He said if 
hed received details of the other four plans at that time, he wouldve taken the same action. 
He says Aviva should therefore calculate his loss based on the rate he got on plan 5546.
Avivas response to my provisional decision
Aviva also responded.  It said that it didnt think the loss assessment should include the three  
plans taken as lump sum payments  because Mr M consistently said he wanted to cash these 
in and wasnt interested in an annuity.  It said having the extra  flexibility  offered by the new 
rules, arising from the delay, provided him with an important benefit which shouldnt be 
overlooked.
Mr Ms complaint comes  back  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have taken into account the responses 
received from Mr M and Aviva. As no new information has been provided, I see no reason  to 
depart from my provisional decision.  My reasons  are largely  unchanged.  I have repeated  
these below, and added  a bit of extra explanation  to deal with the responses received.
Its not in dispute that Aviva  failed to update Mr Ms address  on four of his five pension  
policies until 2015.  The issue left for me to decide  is whether  Mr M has suffered any 
financial loss as a result.
policy 2387
Mr M wrote to Aviva advising  it of his new address so that it was able to communicate with 
him about all of his pension arrangements. It failed to update  its records.  This led to Aviva 
Ref: DRN10186923not contacting Mr M directly for four years on this policy. I therefore think Aviva should  take 
responsibility for any financial loss in relation to policy 2387, as well as the other  policies.
policies 2387,1381 and 8589 
In 2011, when Mr M came to take his benefits  in relation to account 5546,  he opted  to take a 
25% tax free lump  sum and an enhanced  annuity with another  provider. At that time, it 
wasnt open to him to take these three other  polices  as cash lump sums.
My role, as much as possible, is to put Mr M back into the position he wouldve been  in but 
for the error or omission. I think but for Avivas error, Mr M wouldve ended  up taking his 
pension policies in the same way as he did with 5546, if that was possible.  In reaching this 
conclusion, Ive also taken on board  what Mr Ms said - that he thought his other accounts 
had been rolled up into account 5546.  So, I think he was under the mistaken  belief that he 
had already taken  an annuity in respect  of these accounts.
So, I think the fairest way to calculate  Mr Ms loss is to put him back into the situation  he 
wouldve been in, but for the error, as if hed taken the annuities in 2011.  I note the annuity 
Mr M took out in 2011 was an enhanced annuity. Avivas said he wouldnt have been able 
to get an enhanced annuity for policy 2387, but that it wouldve assessed  his circumstances 
in relation to policies 1381 and 8589. If it wouldve been possible for him to take an 
enhanced annuity in respect of the policy, Aviva should proceed on the basis that he 
wouldve taken his annuity in the same way as he did for policy 5546.  If he wasnt  eligible to 
get an enhanced annuity, Aviva should  use its own rate from the relevant time.
I havent overlooked  the fact that Mr M didnt take an annuity in 2016,  after the error came 
to light. Ive proceeded on the basis that Mr M decided then to forego the option of future 
annual annuity  payments,  in return for the immediate  lump sum cash  payments. 
policy 2375
Ive listened carefully  to what Mr M and Aviva  have said. I can see that Mr M has had some 
serious health issues. Aviva says it would be fair to calculate Mr Ms benefits as if theyd 
been taken at his NRA.  It says it can rewrite  the annuity, but this would mean that Mr Ms 
monthly payment  would reduce and he would lose the 5 year guarantee period as this 
wouldve expired  in 2016.
Aviva said that Mr M couldnt get an enhanced  annuity under this policy,  given  it was 
a defined benefit arrangement 
Given Mr Ms health, I think he wouldve likely  taken  some comfort from knowing that his 
annuity payments  were  guaranteed for five years  between  2011  and 2016. If I direct Aviva 
to rewrite his annuity, Mr M cant get that comfort back.
So, I think the fairest way to proceed  is as set out below, acknowledging  Mr Ms loss of 
use of the annuity  payments for some years, but taking  into account that his annuity 
payment is now higher  than it wouldve been if taken out 2011.  I think  the redress  
methodology proposed strikes  a fair balance.  So, I am not directing Aviva to rewrite  the 
annuity.
Ref: DRN10186924fair compensation
Aviva should  pay Mr M fair compensation as set out below:
policies 2387,1381 and 8589
A.Work  out what the 25% lump sum for the policy wouldve been in 2011,  with 8% 
simple interest for loss of use up to 18 or 19 May 2016,  the date when Mr M 
cashed in the policy;
B.Work  out whether  in 2011,  Mr M wouldve  been eligible for an enhanced annuity in 
respect of each  policy. Taking this into account,  calculate the amount of the 
annual annuity  that couldve been  bought with the remaining 75% value of each 
policy in 2011.  If Mr M wouldve been eligible for an enhanced  annuity, the amount 
of the annual annuity should be calculated as if he had taken an enhanced annuity  
in the same way as he did with policy 5546.  If he wasnt  eligible for an enhanced 
annuity, then the calculation  should  be based  on the amount of the annual annuity 
that couldve been bought  through Aviva;
C.For loss of use, Aviva should calculate the loss by multiplying  the sum calculated  at 
B above  by the loss of annual net income  up to 18 or 19 May 2016,  the date 
Mr M cashed in his policy, adding 8% simple interest on each annual  payment from 
the date of the missed  payment, until Mr M cashed in his policy;
D.Aviva  should add A+ C together, and deduct from it the net amount Mr M received 
on18 or 19 May 2016 when he cashed in his policies. If there is a loss, this amount 
should be paid direct to Mr M;
E.Had an annuity been purchased this would have provided a taxable income.
Therefore, the difference paid directly to Mr M should be reduced to notionally 
allow for any income tax that would otherwise have been paid. Aviva should  make 
a notional deduction for tax at Mr Ms marginal rate. It should assume that Mr M is 
a basic rate taxpayer.
For policy ending 2375
Mr M wouldve received a defined benefit  and an annuity. To work out the past loss or
gain: 
A.Mr M wouldve received an annuity  of £453.65  per year on 12 July 2011.  As at
26 January 2017  his annual annuity income  wouldve been £576.84 per year, 
an increase of around £123  per annum;
B.For loss of use of the annuity payment,  Aviva  should multiply the lost net annual 
income of £453.65 up to the date the annuity was purchased,  adding 8% simple 
interest on each annual payment from the date of the missed payment, until the 
date of calculation;
C.Aviva  should calculate  how much  it wouldve  cost on 26 January 2017 to increase 
his annuity income by an extra  £123 per annum. If income tax is payable  in B, it 
should deduct tax at the same rate from the £123 before calculating its cost.  The 
future gain should be deducted from any past loss;
Ref: DRN10186925D.Mr M wouldve been eligible to get £3024.34  in tax free cash on 12 July 2011.  In 
February 2017, he received £3,845.17, Aviva should then deduct from the gain of  
£820.83, the interest Mr M wouldve been liable to receive for the loss of use of the 
tax free cash from 12 July 2011 until the date of payment of the tax free cash in 
February 2017. Aviva can deduct this gain from any past loss.
E.Aviva  should therefore calculate B-C-D and pay this amount directly  to Mr M;
F.This would have provided a taxable income.  Therefore, the difference  paid directly to 
Mr M should be reduced to notionally allow for any income tax that would otherwise 
have been paid. Aviva  should  make a notional deduction for tax at Mr Ms marginal 
rate. It should assume that Mr M is a basic rate taxpayer.
Overall
Aviva should  provide  Mr M with details of its calculation in a clear, simple format.
If HM Revenue & Customs requires Aviva take off tax from this interest. Aviva must give
Mr M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
If there  is a loss in respect of one policy and a gain in respect of another, the loss on one 
policy may be offset against the gain on the other  policy.  Its possible  that Mr M may not 
have suffered any financial loss once the calculations have been completed.
I also think it fair for Aviva to pay Mr M £250,  which it has, for the trouble and upset it has 
caused to his pensions  planning.
my final decision
I uphold Mr Ms complaint and order Aviva  Life & Pensions UK Limited  to pay Mr M any fair 
redress due calculated as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 June 2019.
