The complaint
Mrs B complains about how Santander Consumer (UK) Plc (Santander) has treated her in 
respect of a conditional sale agreement she took out with it for the acquisition of a caravan.
What happened
In July 2017 Mrs B entered into a conditional sale agreement (agreement) with Santander 
for the acquisition of a used caravan.
The cash price of the caravan was £17,000.
Under the terms of the agreement, everything else being equal, Mrs B agreed to make an 
advance payment of £1,700 (to the caravan park) followed by 78 monthly payments 
(to Santander) of £277.78 - making a total sum repayable of £23,366.84 at an 
APR of 11.9%. Mrs B also had the right to end the agreement at any time by handing the 
caravan (back) to Santander and paying Santander half of the total amount payable under 
the agreement of £11,683.42 (£23,366.84/2).
In August 2018 Mrs B enquired about voluntary terminating her agreement with Santander 
but decided not to.
Mrs B made all payments required of her under the agreement between August 2017 and 
February 2019  19 payments of £277.78 or £5,277.82. This brought her agreement debt 
(inclusive of all interest) down to £16,389.02 (£23,366.84 - £1,700.00 - £5,277.82).
In March 2019 Mrs B contacted Santander to confirm that she had vacated the caravan and 
had handed the keys to it to the caravan park.
In April 2019 Santander credited Mrs Bs account with £8,737.50, this being the proceeds it 
received following the sale of the caravan back to the caravan park. This brought her 
agreement debt (inclusive of all interest) down to £7,651.52 (£16,389.02 - £8,737.50).
In May 2019 Santander credited Mrs Bs account with £2,945.92. This brought her 
agreement debt (inclusive of all interest) down to £4,705.60 (£7,651.52 - £2,945.92). 
After May 2019 Santander, and then a third party, acting on Santanders behalf, wrote to 
Mrs B seeking recovery of the sum of £4,705.60.
In July 2019 Mrs B complained to Santander to say that she felt it hadnt treated her fairly 
after she took the decision to vacate the caravan and return the keys to the caravan park, 
particularly given the reason why she did so was because she was in financial difficulties. 
And to resolve her complaint she was looking for the balance of £4,705.60 to be written off.
Later the same month Santander issued Mrs B with a final response letter (FRL). Under 
cover of this FRL Santander said it was satisfied that it had done nothing wrong and that it 
wasnt prepared to write off the £4,705.60. However, it said it was prepared to agree an 
affordable repayment arrangement going forward.
In September 2019, and unhappy with Santanders FRL, Mrs B referred her complaint to our 
service for investigation.
Mrs Bs complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
Santander had done nothing wrong.
Mrs B didnt agree with the investigators view, so the complaint has been passed to me for 
review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I can confirm that Ive come to the same outcome as the investigator and for 
the same reasons. There is also very little I can usefully add to what has already been said.
Im satisfied that following Mrs Bs decision to vacate the caravan and to hand the keys to it 
to the caravan park, Santander acted fairly (and to Mrs Bs financial advantage) by treating 
the agreement as being voluntary terminated rather the caravan being voluntary 
surrendered. Had Santander treated the caravan as being voluntary surrendered, the only 
other alternative available, Mrs B would have been left with a liability in excess of the 
£4,705.60 currently being sought from her.
The sum calculated by Santander as being outstanding and due (of £4,705.60) has been 
calculated correctly. This has been calculated as follows:
Total repayable under the agreement (inclusive of interest) £23,366.84
50% of the above sum £11,683.42
Deposit paid £1,700.00
Payments made (19 x £277.78) £5,277.82 (£6,977.82)
Total repayable £4,705.60
I appreciate the financial difficulties Mrs B says she is in, but Santander is under no 
obligation to write off the sum of £4,705.60 because of these difficulties. 
Instead, what Santander is obliged to do (under its regulatory obligations), is to exercise 
forbearance and due consideration. And given that Santander has said that its prepared to 
agree to an affordable repayment arrangement with Mrs B going forward Im satisfied that 
Santander has done what I would expect it to, and what the regulator requires it to do.My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 February 2022.
