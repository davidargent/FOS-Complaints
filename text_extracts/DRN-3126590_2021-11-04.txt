The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has refused to refund him for a
purchase that he didnt receive.
What happened
Mr B says he bought an item for just over Â£73 via PayPal but he didnt receive it. He says he
tried contacting the seller but without success. Mr B says he contacted the delivery
company, which I will call F, and says it told him the details he provided didnt match. He
says he told PayPal that, but it told him it had evidence of delivery and so didnt uphold his
claim.
PayPal says the seller provided tracking information that showed the item was delivered. It
says F only provides it with confirmation of delivery and doesnt provide the exact address
details.
Mr B brought his complaint to us and investigator upheld it in the sense she asked PayPal to
review its decision. The investigator thought information about two delivery companies had
been provided and that no evidence of actual delivery to Mr Bs address had been provided,
just delivery in his general area.
PayPal has reviewed its decision and says it relied on the evidence it was given and has
acted in line with its user agreement.
My provisional view
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and said that I didnt uphold this complaint. I
appreciated Mr B would be disappointed by it and I made clear to him that we are not 
PayPals regulator. So, its not our role to tell it what evidence of delivery it accepts in these
circumstances. I also appreciated Mr B will no doubt question why F cant provide PayPal 
with evidence of delivery to an actual address and in this case evidence of where Mr Bs 
item was delivered to.
I looked carefully at PayPals user agreement which deals with these sorts of disputes.
I could see PayPal makes clear that it may not uphold a buyers complaint if a seller can
provide evidence the item was delivered. I thought that is what happened here that the seller
provided PayPal with evidence of delivery which it accepted. So, I didnt think PayPal made 
a mistake or acted unfairly by deciding in line with the user agreement that the seller had
provide required information and so it was not upholding Mr Bs complaint.
I was also satisfied it was up to PayPal to decide upon such matters and to determine what
evidence it accepts. I made clear that I didnt know why F couldnt provide more accurate
information but that is something Mr B may have to take up with it, if he is able to do so. I
appreciated F may not speak to Mr B about such matters, but I hoped PayPal could explain 
or provide further information about this issue. And why it relies on general delivery evidence
rather than evidence of, as in this case, delivery to Mr Bs address.
Overall my provisional view was that PayPal has acted in line with its user agreement and so 
it would be unfair to ask it to do anything further in the circumstances of this complaint. But I
hoped it would explain further the delivery question I have asked of it. I could see that 
PayPal did review its decision as recommended by the investigator. I had no doubt Mr B 
didnt receive the item but that didnt mean it follows that PayPal is responsible for what took
place.
Neither Mr B or PayPal wish to add anything further to this complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the same view that I reached in my provisional decision and 
for the same reasons. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 December 2021.
