The complaint
Ms S complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA has refused to refund her for items 
bought that were not as described and or damaged.
What happened
Ms S says she bought some plants online via her PayPal account. She says some of the 
items were not as described and others were damaged. Ms S says she was told by PayPal 
to send the items back at her own cost but says that was unfair and in any event could not 
send plants back in the same original state as when received. She says she lost about Â£17 
and would like compensation for the stress caused as well as that money refunded. 
PayPal says it told Ms S on a number of occasions that she needed to send the items back 
to be eligible for a refund. It says its user agreement makes that requirement clear and that a 
buyer is responsible for the return costs. PayPal says Ms S made clear she would not send 
the items back at her own cost and so it rejected her claim.
Ms S brought her complaint to us and our investigator didnt uphold it. The investigator 
thought, in line with the user agreement, that Ms S was required to return the items at her 
own cost. The investigator thought PayPal had told Ms S that but she refused to do so.
Ms S doesnt accept that view and in summary says it was impossible to send the items 
back in their original state and says she didnt want to risk sending them back at her own 
cost. She says PayPal didnt offer any help or advice and complains about how it dealt with 
her complaint. She also says its unreasonable to expect a buyer to pay for the return costs in 
these circumstances and says those costs should be covered by the business.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have come to the overall view that I dont uphold this complaint.
I have looked carefully at PayPals user agreement which covers this sort of issue and which 
I think Ms S would have agreed to when the account was opened. The agreement makes 
clear that PayPal may require a buyer in these circumstances to return an item at the buyers 
cost. So, I dont think PayPal made a mistake or acted unfairly by telling Ms S that in order to 
be eligible for a refund that she needed to return the items in question. Im satisfied that Ms 
S didnt return the items and so it follows that I dont think she was entitled to a refund from 
PayPal under its protection scheme.
I appreciate Ms S says she couldnt return the items in their original state but I am satisfied 
that she could reasonably have returned the items if she wished and that PayPal made clear 
that is what she was required to do on a number of occasions. I can see from PayPals 
records that Ms S made it clear to PayPal that she was not willing to pay for the return 
postage. I accept that was Ms Ss choice but equally by making that decision Im satisfied 
that she didnt meet the user agreement terms and conditions for receiving a refund.
I appreciate Ms S says its unreasonable for a buyer in these circumstances to pay for any 
return costs and it should be the business that pays for it. But its not our role to assess the 
fairness of PayPals user agreement which I think Ms S agreed to and in any event, we cant 
force the business which sold the plants to pay for the return costs.
I accept that PayPals final response letter to Ms S did not cover in detail the issues she 
raised or comment on what she said about the original state of the items. But Im satisfied 
that PayPal did make clear to Ms S that she needed to return the items at her own cost and 
that is the key part of this complaint, that she chose not to do so.
The investigator has made clear that we cant consider the separate complaint Ms S makes 
about PayPals complaint handling. And overall, Im satisfied that Ms S didnt meet the user 
agreement requirements for receiving a refund.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 July 2022.
