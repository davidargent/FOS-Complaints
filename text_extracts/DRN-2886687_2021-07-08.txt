The complaint
Mrs M complains that NewDay Ltd lent irresponsibly when it approved two credit cards and a 
loan in her name. Mrs M also complains that NewDay increased her credit limit.
What happened
In August 2017 Mrs M applied for a credit card with Marble. In the application, Mrs M said 
she was a employed earning £28,000, a tenant and had around £9,100 of unsecured debt. 
Marbles carried out a credit search and didnt find any adverse credit or arrears. A credit limit 
of £300 was approved.
NewDay went on to increase the credit limit on Mrs Ms Marbles credit card in stages to 
£2,600 in August 2018. In September 2018 Mrs M applied for a Debenhams credit card with 
NewDay. In the application, Mrs M said she was employed and earned around £30,000. Mrs 
M also gave details of her partners income. Mrs M recorded her outgoings as around £1,300 
a month. Mrs M said she had around £12,000 of unsecured credit. NewDay completed 
another credit check but didnt find any adverse information. The application was approved 
with a credit limit of £1,750. 
In November 2018 Mrs M applied for a loan for £5,000. The application was made on the 
basis of an income of £1,900 after tax each month and NewDay included outgoings of 
around £1,100. NewDay says it looked at Mrs Ms credit file and didnt find any adverse 
information. The loan was approved and Mrs M began making monthly repayments. 
In March 2019 and October 2019 NewDay increased the credit limit on Mrs Ms Marbles 
credit limit, reaching £4,400. NewDay says that, each time, its decision to approve the credit 
limit increase was in line with its lending criteria and took Mrs Ms existing credit card use 
and credit file into account. 
Mrs M complained to NewDay that it had lent irresponsibly. NewDay responded to Mrs Ms 
complaint but didnt agree it had lent irresponsibly. NewDay said it had carried out lending 
checks before each decision to approve new borrowing. Mrs M referred her complaint to this 
service and it was passed to an investigator. They thought NewDay had dealt with Mrs Ms 
complaint fairly and didnt ask it to do anything else. Mrs M didnt agree so her complaint has 
been passed to me to make a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs M has complained about two credit cards and a loan that NewDay approved over a 
period of around two years. Before a business agrees to lend, it should complete reasonable 
and proportionate checks to satisfy itself the borrower can maintain the repayments in a 
sustainable way. Theres no set list of checks lenders have to carry out. Factors like the 
applicants income and circumstances, amount of the borrowing, term and number of other 
commitments along with what a business knows about the borrower will all be taken into 
account when deciding what checks are proportionate. Ive looked at whether NewDay 
carried out proportionate checks when it offered new lending to Mrs M. 
When Mrs M first applied for a Marbles credit card she told NewDay her income was 
£28,000 and that she had around £9,100 of unsecured debts. NewDay carried out a credit 
search and didnt find any adverse information. NewDay found unsecured credit that was in 
line with the amount Mrs M gave in her application. NewDay applied its lending criteria and 
approved Mrs Ms application with a credit limit of £300. Im satisfied NewDay carried out 
proportionate checks when it approved Mrs Ms Marbles credit card and that it lent 
responsibly. 
NewDay increased Mrs Ms credit limit in stages to £2,600 by August 2018. Ive looked at the 
information NewDay took into account and can see it continued to review Mrs Ms credit file. 
No new adverse information was found. I can see Mrs M did make a late payment and also 
went £50 over the credit limit but NewDay says its lending criteria took these into account. I 
havent seen anything in the information NewDay had available that showed Mrs M was 
experiencing financial difficulties. Im satisfied NewDay did complete proportionate checks 
before deciding to increase Mrs Ms credit limit and that its decision to do so was 
reasonable. 
Mrs M applied for another credit card in September 2018. In her application, Mrs M gave a 
slightly increased income figure and also provided details of the total household income. Mrs 
M provided living and accommodation costs as well. Mrs M also gave an unsecured credit 
figure of around £12,000 that was confirmed when NewDay looked at her credit file. I note 
Mrs M owed around £1,200 on her Marbles credit card against a credit limit of £2,600. 
NewDay has told us it took Mrs Ms income and outgoings into account along with the 
information found on her credit file. NewDay says Mrs Ms existing credit card had been well 
maintained and its decision to approve the new card was in line with its lending criteria. Ive 
considered all the available information and Im satisfied NewDay did carry out proportionate 
checks before deciding whether to approve Mrs Ms new credit card. I havent found 
NewDay lent irresponsibly. 
In November 2018 Mrs M applied for a loan with NewDay to consolidate other credit 
commitments. NewDay has says it used Mrs Ms declared income of £1,900 a month after 
tax, along with the household income it previously recorded. NewDay also took Mrs Ms 
living costs into account when deciding whether to proceed. NewDay says it didnt find any 
evidence of arrears or new adverse credit showing on Mrs Ms credit file and that its decision 
to approve the loan was in line with its lending criteria. I also think its reasonable to note Mrs 
M has told us she took the loan to consolidate other debts. And bank statements provided 
show Mrs M did use the loan funds for that purpose. Im sorry to disappoint Mrs M, but I think 
NewDays decision to approve her loan was reasonable based on the information it had 
available. 
In March and October 2019 NewDay increased the Marbles credit limit, reaching £4,400. 
Again, NewDay says it took Mrs Ms income and outgoings into account along with 
information it found on her credit file. NewDay also looked at how Mrs Ms credit card had 
operated. I can see the balance was substantially below the credit limit both times NewDay 
increased it. Ive looked at the checks NewDay carried out and Im satisfied they were 
proportionate in this case and havent found its decision to increase the credit limit was 
unreasonable. 
Im very sorry to disappoint Mrs M but Im satisfied NewDay did complete proportionate 
checks and that its decision to approve the credit cards and later increase the credit limit 
was reasonable. Im also satisfied NewDays decision to approve the debt consolidation loan 
Mrs M applied for was reasonable based on the information it had available. As Im satisfied NewDay lent responsibly and that it has dealt with Mrs Ms complaint fairly, Im not telling it 
to take any further action.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 August 2021.
