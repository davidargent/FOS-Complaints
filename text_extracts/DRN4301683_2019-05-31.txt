K821x#15complaint
Mr A complains through  a third party about  loans CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as 
QuickQuid) lent to him. Mr A says QuickQuid irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about nine payday  loans QuickQuid provided  to Mr A between June 2016 
and January 2018. Ive detailed some information  about the loans in an appendix at the end 
of this decision. Mr A took out additional borrowing on six of the nine loans and this meant  
that QuickQuid made a total of 23 advances  during  the lending relationship. Mr A has fully 
repaid all his loans.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr As complaint in part and thought loan 5 and the subsequent  
loans shouldnt have  been given. QuickQuid  disagreed and the complaint  was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr A 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
In response to our adjudication, QuickQuid disagreed that it had done anything wrong during 
the course of its lending  relationship with Mr A. It provided further detail about the checks it 
had made  when it approved loans from March 2015  onwards and sent a document called 
CEU Lending Criteria  and Proportional Checks. 
Ref: DRN43016832This service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic argument directly  and through  
earlier final decisions. So Im not going  to expand on this point any further  here, though Ive 
considered it alongside  everything  else in making my decision. Ive focussed my decision on 
the specifics of Mr As complaint and what both parties have said about this.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr A could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to make repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr As complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan 4 would most likely  have shown  
that Mr A could sustainably afford the loan.  Also, the adjudicator explained that she thought 
the checks QuickQuid  carried  out for loans 1 to 3 went far enough. And so our adjudicator 
didnt recommend that loans 1 to 4 should be upheld. Ive looked  at the circumstances 
around these loans and I agree with the adjudicators findings. Neither Mr A nor his 
representatives have  disagreed with the adjudication  and as there  isnt an ongoing dispute 
about loans 1 to 4, I havent gone into further details about them here.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Mr A, with a view to 
see if there was a point  at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised 
that it shouldnt  have provided  any further  loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr As case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
5. I say this because from loan 5 onwards  Mr A was provided with a new loan within days of 
settling a previous  one. In some cases,  Mr A took out a new loan on the same day he repaid 
a previous one. For example, Mr A took out loan 3 on the day he repaid loan 2 and on the 
day he repaid loan 4, he borrowed loan 5. I can see that Mr A repaid most of his loans early 
and in the case of loan 8, he repaid it on the same day he took out. Early repayments of the 
loans doesnt  necessarily mean that the loans were affordable and in Mr As case  I think  it 
suggests that he was likely struggling  to manage his finances and thats why he needed to 
keep borrowing. This shouldve concerned QuickQuid.
Ref: DRN43016833Mr A was also regularly taking out additional borrowing on loans for a large part of the 
lending relationship. For example after Mr A borrowed  loan 2, he topped-up the loan three 
times between 12 January 2017  and 15 January 2017. Also when  Mr A took out loan 6, he 
took out three additional borrowing between 9 July 2017 and 11 July 2017. Mr A topping  up 
his loans consecutive  days after the initial advance should also have concerned QuickQuid. 
I think Mr As overall pattern of borrowing shouldve alerted QuickQuid that Mr A was likely 
dependent on these loans. So in the circumstances QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was 
more likely than not Mr A was having  to borrow further to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr As indebtedness was increasing 
unsustainably.
Also, Mr A wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid. Loan 9 was 
taken out nearly  20 months after Mr As first. Mr As borrowing steadily  increased  through the 
course of the lending  and he paid large amounts  of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
over an extended period.  QuickQuid itself says its loans arent suitable for long term use and 
so it shouldve seen  that Mr A wasnt using the loans for their intended purpose of short term 
cash flow problems.
As QuickQuid continued to provide  borrowing from loan 5 onwards, I think Mr A lost out. This 
is because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr As indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Mr A deferred the repayment of loans 3, 5 and 6 and these deferrals along with the 
sheer number of loans   23 advances in total,  were likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr As ability to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 5 to 9 and QuickQuid should put things right.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr A paid on loans 5 to 9 issued from 12 May 2017 to 
30 January 2018;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 5 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 to 9 should be removed from 
Mr As credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Mr A a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN43016834my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr As complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
should pay Mr A compensation as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 July 2019.
