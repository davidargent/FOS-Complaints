Mr C says that the loans  trapped him in a spiral of debt as the repayments  took so much of 
his income he had to borrow  again  to cover his other  debt repayments  and living costs. He 
says he was borrowing  from other short term loan providers and he couldnt afford his 
repayments. He says the loans caused him stress  and had an impact both on his 
relationships and health.
QuickQuid noted  that loans  one to 15 were provided more than six years  before the 
complaint and said that before loan 16 was provided  it carried out affordability assessments 
including reviewing Mr Cs credit file and validating his income and expenses before the loan 
was provided. 
QuickQuid says that when Mr C advised it of his financial  difficulties  it attempted  to help him 
with a repayment arrangement and it offered to work with Mr Cs debt management 
company.
Our adjudicator said she didnt have enough  evidence to say it was unfair that loans one to 
three were provided. But she thought loans four to 16 shouldnt  have been lent.
QuickQuid didnt accept  our adjudicators view. It offered to refund the interest and charges 
paid on loans four, five, seven, eight, 10, 11, 12, 15 and 16. In regard to the other  loans it 
noted the amounts taken out and gaps in Mr Cs lending history.
Ref: DRN76340282my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr C could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts and 
the consumer's  income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
At that time of the loans the relevant guidance  was provided by the Office  of Fair trading 
(OFT). In its March  2010 guide  concerning  irresponsible lending it set out the need to make 
a reasonable assessment of whether a borrower can afford to meet  repayments in a 
sustainable manner.  This refers to issues such as being able to the make  the repayments  
without undue difficulties  throughout the life of the agreement and without having to realise 
security or assets. It then further sets out that without  undue difficulty  means without having 
to borrow further. Therefore I have considered whether QuickQuid did enough  to ensure that 
lending to Mr C was sustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.
Mr C took out the first loan in February  2009 and then he was taking  out new loans shortly 
after repaying previous  loans.  I note the comments QuickQuid has made about breaks in his 
borrowing but these  were never more than a few weeks and often much shorter. So I dont  
think it would  have  been reasonable for QuickQuid to conclude these were  any indication  
that Mr Cs finances  had moved on from whatever  situation had required his previous loans. 
Because of this I have considered all the loans as being part of the same lending chain.
Ref: DRN76340283Before the loans were  provided, QuickQuid carried out credit  check  and recorded Mr Cs 
monthly income. His income for the duration  of the loans was recorded as £1,215. I havent 
seen details of the credit searches. Our adjudicator said that she didnt have enough  to say 
that the first three loans  shouldnt  have  been  provided. I agree with this.
Loan four was for £450  and was repayable in one payment of just under £550. This was a 
substantial amount compared to Mr Cs income.  I havent seen evidence of his expenses 
from the time although I note he was in rented accommodation. Given  the size of the 
repayment compared to Mr Cs income I think there  was a significant risk that he wouldnt 
have been able to meet his existing  commitments  without having  to borrow again. Therefore 
I dont think this loan should have been considered sustainably affordable. 
Loan five was for the same amount  as loan four and although Mr Cs sixth loan was for a 
smaller amount, given  his pattern of borrowing and concerns about the previous loans being 
sustainably affordable I dont think that any of loans four to six should have been provided.
By loan seven, I think that Mr Cs overall  pattern of borrowing suggested he had become 
persistently reliant  on short-term loans. Mr C had taken seven loans in eight months, and the 
amounts he was borrowing were not reducing  for any sustained period.  This continued  to be 
the situation through the rest of his borrowing relationship with QuickQuid. Because of this I 
dont think that QuickQuid should  have  considered  any of the loans from this point onwards 
as being sustainable.
Overall, I think that Mr C lost out because  QuickQuid  continued  to provide borrowing from 
loan four onwards. These loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Mr C's indebtedness  by 
allowing him to take expensive  credit  intended for short term use over an extended period of 
time. The sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr C's 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
I note the offer made  by QuickQuid and can see this included  a number of the loans from 
loan four onwards. However, because of the reasons set out above, I think refunds should 
be applied  to all loans  from loan four onwards.
Ref: DRN76340284my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans  four to 16. CashEuroNet  
UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid)  should:
refund  all interest and charges that Mr C paid on the loans from loan four onwards;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
if there is a balance outstanding, QuickQuid should apply the overall refund to reduce 
the outstanding balance  and pay any balance to Mr C;
remove any negative information  about loans four to six from Mr Cs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan seven (5 October 2009)  means any information 
recorded about them is adverse. So all entries  about those loans should be removed 
from Mr Cs credit  file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr C a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 August 2019.
