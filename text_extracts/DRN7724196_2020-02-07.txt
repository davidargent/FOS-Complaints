K821x#15complaint
Mr S says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him.
background
This complaint is about 35 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mr S between 
November 2016  and July 2018.  Ive listed Mr Ss borrowing  history  for the first ten loans (I 
have rounded the figures):

Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ss complaint  and thought  the loans from loan five 
onwards shouldnt have been  given. Sunny disagreed but did make  an offer of redress  for 
loan 24 onwards. Mr S didnt accept the offer so the complaint was passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
Ref: DRN77241962the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr S could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ss complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Ss complaint 
in part and have explained why below.
Mr S didnt disagree with our adjudicators  opinion that loans one to four shouldnt  be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there  is any ongoing  disagreement about  these  loans. So I 
wont be making a decision about  this lending.  But the loans were  part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr S had with Sunny.  So it is something  I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Like the adjudicator  I agree that by loan five Sunny should have carried  out proportionate 
checks on whether Mr S was having  problems managing his money. I say this because Mr S 
had taken five loans in just over five weeks. And the amounts  he was borrowing ranged  from 
£100 to the higher amount of £250 by loan five. So, while I appreciate  the amounts borrowed 
varied, the trend of borrowing was increasing in amount. I think this should  have sign posted 
to Sunny that Mr S may have been  struggling  with managing his finances and should have 
checked further.
If it had done so  whether by taking  further steps  to find out what other  financial  
commitments Mr S had, as an example  it would  have become aware that Mr S was using 
other short-term lenders  which  needed  financing along with his commitments to Sunny, two 
of which  were still running when Mr S took loan five. The credit report Mr S has given us 
shows at the time he applied for loan five with Sunny, he have four other  loans with another  
provider which cost him just under £380  a month  to finance. This accounted  for a significant 
percentage of Mr Ss monthly disposable  income  as recorded by Sunny at the point  of 
application for loan five. 
Ref: DRN77241963So I think Sunny  should  have carried out proportionate checks to appropriately  check  
whether Mr S was in a position  to sustainably make his repayments.
And Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending  history with Mr S, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ss case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
eight. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr S was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. Mr S had taken out seven previous loans  within  three months. So Sunny 
ought to have realised it was more likely  than not Mr S was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying his previous, and other loans, was leaving in his finances 
and that Mr Ss indebtedness  was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 35 was 
taken out 21 months after Mr Ss first. Mr S had paid large  amounts of interest  to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny  over an extended  period.  He was becoming 
persistently reliant on short-term loans. 
I think that Mr S lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan eight 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ss indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr S borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Ss ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans five to 35 and Sunny 
should put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr S paid on loans five to 35;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans five to seven  from Mr Ss credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan eight onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans five to 35 should be removed from 
Mr Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr S a certificate  showing  how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN77241964my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Ss complaint. 
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 March 2020.
