The complaint
Mr B is unhappy with how PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA dealt with a dispute raised under 
PayPals buyer protection programme. 
What happened
Mr B found an item on an online marketplace, which he wished to buy. He contacted the 
seller of the item and asked a few questions about the item. And then agreed to purchase it. 
The cost to Mr B was £1,285, which included a cost for shipping. Mr B paid through PayPal.
The seller asked Mr B to send screenshots evidencing he had sent the above payment. Mr B 
did this and was told by the seller that the item was be dispatched to him the following day.
But the item wasnt dispatched. Instead, Mr B said he received communication from PayPal, 
noting that Mr B had raised a dispute, under PayPals buyer protection programme. But, 
instead of the dispute being raised for the full cost of the item, the dispute had been raised 
for £20.
Mr B has explained that he contacted PayPal and explained that he hadnt raised the 
dispute. He felt a third party (perhaps the seller) had done this. Mr B raised concerns about 
the legitimacy of the transaction. And said that any dispute should be for the full transaction 
amount anyway. 
Mr B said PayPal didnt act of the concerns he had raised. Instead, it processed the dispute, 
as one for £20. The dispute was successful, and the £20 refunded. Mr B didnt agree this 
was the right thing for PayPal to have done. He therefore raised his concerns with PayPal  
but its position on the matter didnt change. Mr B sought a chargeback through his bank for 
the funds he had lost  which was successful.
As Mr B remained dissatisfied with PayPals position on the matter, he referred his complaint 
to this service for an independent review. Mr B explained to this service that he wanted 
PayPal to compensate him for the stress and effort hed had to go to, to get his money back. 
He said these problems were due to security issues PayPal had. He considered the amount 
he said was stolen from him, to be fair and reasonable compensation.
Our investigator considered this complaint and didnt think it should be upheld. They said 
they hadnt seen PayPal had done anything wrong, as there was no evidence of third-party 
activity on Mr Bs account. Meaning that there wasnt evidence that another party raised the 
dispute for £20. Our investigator said PayPal dealt with the dispute as it should have done 
and refunded the £20 disputed. In addition to this, they said Mr B hadnt been financially 
impacted by the situation, as he had received his money back through his bank anyway.
Mr B didnt agree. He reiterated his concerns about someone else raising the dispute. And 
noted he didnt raise it himself. Mr B provided itemised telephone bills, and an explanation of 
what calls he had made to PayPal, to explain that he hadnt raised the dispute himself.
Because Mr B didnt agree, this complaint has been referred to me to decide.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. In this I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im intending on upholding this complaint in part, and requiring PayPal to 
pay Mr B £100 compensation. Ive explained why below.
PayPals buyer protection programme explain that a buyer may be eligible for a transaction 
refund, in certain circumstances. These specific circumstances include where an item is 
received but is significantly not as described or where the item was not received.
In Mr Bs case, Im aware a significantly not described claim was raised for an item Mr B 
had purchased on 11 April 2022. Ive therefore considered whether PayPal acted fairly in 
how it dealt with this claim, in light of what Mr B has said above.
PayPal has explained that the initial claim raised was for £20. And Mr B said he received 
communication from PayPal, saying the same. But Mr B said he didnt raise this initial claim. 
And not for that amount. So, Ive thought about this.
I recognise that Mr B has said he didnt raise the matter. But I dont think this means PayPal 
acted unfairly when the claim was first raised. Ive seen screenshots of PayPals system, 
which shows a dispute was raised through its system, via Mr Bs mobile number. So, I dont 
think PayPal acted unfairly in processing the claim as instructed to. It said there was no 
indication that Mr B hadnt raised the matter. And I havent seen any evidence that might 
have suggested this to PayPal either. So, I dont think it acted unfairly in opening the claim 
and starting to look into it, considering it seem to come from Mr B.
I do however think PayPal could have provided a better service to Mr B following his 
conversations with it on 12 April 2022. Ive listened to call recordings of conversations Mr B 
had with PayPal on this date. He contacted it and said he hadnt raised the dispute. He did 
confirm he wanted a dispute raised now, but for the full amount (£1,285), given that he 
wasnt going to be receiving the item he had purchased. So, I think it was right for PayPal to 
continue considering the dispute.
But, at this point PayPal told Mr B it would update the claim to the full transaction amount, 
rather than the £20. And it assured Mr B the whole amount was placed on hold. However, it 
doesnt appear the amount claimed for was updated as Mr B was told. I say this because 
when Mr B was provided with the outcome to the claim, it was awarded in his favour, but for 
only £20. This meant the remainder of the transaction hadnt been considered, and Mr B 
wasnt provided with this.
Ive also seen a further online chat with PayPal on 24 April 2022, a few days after the 
outcome of the dispute was communicated to him. Mr B raised that the dispute shouldnt 
have been for £20. PayPal then told him:
I see that the case has been closed in your favour and a refund has been processed by the 
seller for the same. Our policy does not allow us to change the dispute amount, if, there is an 
error when filing the dispute initially. 
We request you contact the merchant and work with them for rest of the refund associated in 
this regard.Given the above, I do think Mr B received potentially incorrect information when speaking to 
PayPal on 12 April 2022. He was led to believe a claim for the whole amount was to be 
considered, but that wasnt the case. 
PayPal has said that Mr B could have appealed its initial decision on his claim. But it hasnt 
provided anything that shows me Mr B was told this. And the above online chat tells Mr B to 
take the issue up with the merchant. So, I can appreciate why Mr B felt there was no further 
avenue to pursue through PayPal.
Mr B did raise the matter with his card issuer and received a refund for £1,265 through his 
card provider. Meaning Mr B did ultimately get the full transaction amount back. So, I dont 
think PayPal needs to do anything more in respect of that. It wouldnt be fair to ask PayPal to 
pay this to Mr B too. The terms of the PayPal buyer protection state you cant receive the 
sum both from it, and from the card provider. And it wouldnt be reasonable for Mr B to 
benefit from the issue.
But I do think it would be fair and reasonable for PayPal to pay some compensation to Mr B. 
Ive thought about what fair and reasonable compensation looks like in this case, considering 
the impact of the situation on Mr B. And Im satisfied £100 is a fair and reasonable amount. 
So, thats what I intend to award. I consider this to be fair, as it isnt this services role to 
punish a business. And I think the £100 fairly recognises the trouble and inconvenience Mr B 
experienced by receiving the above misinformation. 
Both parties responded to my provisional decision and agreed with it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold this complaint in part, and require PayPal to pay 
Mr B £100 compensation. 
There hasnt been any further comments or evidence from either party, to alter my findings 
on this complaint, or the reasoning for it. And so, my decision remains the same as that in 
my provisional decision, and for the same reasons.
My final decision
Given the above, my provisional decision is that I intend on upholding this complaint in part 
and requiring PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie to pay Mr B £100 compensation. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 April 2023.
