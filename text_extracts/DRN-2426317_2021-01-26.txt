The complaint
Miss J complains she was unfairly charged fees on her credit card account by NewDay Ltd 
trading as Marbles Card (NewDay). Shes also unhappy NewDay ignored her complaint.
What happened
Around September 2019 Miss J says she paid her monthly payment on her credit card 
before the statement was sent. Shed paid it too early to count towards the minimum amount 
due that statement month and a fee was applied to her account. On 4 October 2019, she 
contacted NewDay to query the fee. NewDay says it wasnt clear at the time what Miss J 
was unhappy about. But the contact notes weve been given say if she was to call back, it 
should be explained, the fee could be refunded if she cleared the over limit amount.
A few days later, Miss J made several calls to NewDay during which she raised a complaint. 
The notes say she ended the calls early and she was reluctant to tell the call handlers why 
she was calling. The investigation notes say her complaint was about not being called back 
and having to provide her identity information each time she called. NewDay didnt think it 
did anything wrong but it refunded three fees applied to her account as a goodwill gesture.
Unhappy NewDay hadnt looked into things properly, Miss J came to our service. When she 
initially complained, she said shed been overcharged interest and as NewDay thought this 
was a new complaint, it asked for time to look into it. It later became clear Miss J was 
unhappy with the fees added  and she says NewDay ignored this complaint previously.
Our investigator upheld the complaint. He thought the call notes indicated Miss J had raised 
a complaint about payment issues on 4 October 2019 so NewDay shouldve realised what 
her complaint to our service was about. He didnt think NewDay had provided a good 
enough service and had delayed things being resolved. He thought the fees were charged 
fairly but said NewDay should refund the remaining three fees charged between October 
and December 2019 and pay Miss J Â£100 for the delays and frustration caused.
NewDay didnt agree with our investigator. It said the fees had been charged in line with its 
terms. It didnt think it was obvious Miss J was complaining about the same thing she raised 
during the call on 4 October 2019 and it wasnt unreasonable to expect shed go into more 
detail about what her complaint was about. As the complaint wasnt resolved, it was passed 
to me to decide.
my provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in November 2020. I didnt think the 
complaint should be upheld, in summary because:
I thought the charges were applied fairly when Miss J went over her credit limit.
I wasnt satisfied Miss J raised a complaint on 4 October 2019 when she called NewDay 
 or that it shouldve been clear that this conversation formed part of her complaint.
Miss Js said the complaint made her anxious but I thought it was reasonable to expect 
shed explain why she was unhappy so NewDay could look into things.
I wasnt satisfied it shouldve been clear that Miss J was actually unhappy about the fees 
applied to her account or that her complaint related to her call on 4 October 2019.
I wasnt persuaded NewDay was ignoring Miss Js complaint or that it shouldve been 
aware of it because of her call some days before. 
I accepted the call handler on 4 October 2019 couldve told Miss J NewDay was willing 
to refund the overlimit fee rather than only writing it in the call notes. But as it refunded 
the fees as a goodwill gesture later anyway, I didnt think this made a difference.
I asked both parties to make any further comments before I reached a final decision. 
NewDay didnt respond to my decision. Miss J said she didnt agree with my decision and 
felt I had ignored that shed made a complaint online. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss J has said she made a complaint online to NewDay but shes not given us any further 
details. That includes when she made it or whether it was about this same issue. Ive 
checked NewDays complaint notes, and the only reference I can see to Miss J complaining 
online is when NewDay suggested she do so if she didnt want to provide her verification 
details over the phone. And she told the call handler shed prefer to speak to someone. She 
didnt mention here that shed already done so and it hadnt been responded to.
In any event, even if Miss J did make a complaint online, I dont think it makes a difference to 
the outcome of this complaint. I say that because Miss J got in touch with NewDay over the 
phone shortly after she thought something had gone wrong. And although it didnt agree 
there was a problem, it refunded three of the fees charged as a goodwill gesture. And I think 
its unlikely it wouldve done anything differently  or significantly quicker  if it had 
responded to her online complaint. So whilst I appreciate Miss J might feel frustrated if she 
didnt get a response to her online complaint, I think NewDay has already done enough.
 
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, I dont uphold Miss Js complaint. Under the rules of the 
Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss J to accept or reject my decision 
before 26 February 2021.
