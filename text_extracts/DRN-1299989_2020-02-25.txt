The complaint
Miss D complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) has unfairly placed 
restrictions on her account and wont allow her access to her money.
What happened
Miss D opened an account with PayPal in 2016. When she opened the account, she used 
her full first name and the first letter of her surname. Miss D has explained that she did this 
due to concerns about security. Miss D has been using the account since that time.
In July 2019, PayPal contacted Miss D to let her know it had put some restrictions on her 
account as it needed to verify some of her account information. PayPal asked her to send a 
valid identification document.
In September 2019 Miss D provided PayPal with her driving licence. But as the name didnt 
match the name on the account, PayPal placed a permanent restriction on the account and 
put a temporary hold on the funds that were in the account. Around the same time, Miss D 
received a payment of around £170 from a third party, which needed to be refunded. Miss D 
refunded that payment on 8 October 2019, following a significant amount of contact and 
dissatisfaction from the third party who had sent the funds.
Miss D remains unhappy that her account has been restricted and that PayPal hasnt 
refunded her remaining funds. She says she shouldnt have to provide full details of her 
name as this information is passed on to third parties and she would prefer to keep her 
personal information private. But, she says she did provide PayPal with her full name and 
she had credit card information on file in her full name so PayPal were aware of it. She also 
questions why PayPal didnt identify this sooner and allowed her to use the account for three 
years before applying this restriction.
PayPal said that its User Agreement specified that Miss D needed to provide her full name 
for the account. And it said that its put a hold on the funds in her account for 180 days due 
to the risk of any chargebacks or payment reversals from third parties. It also says that this 
discrepancy was noticed during a standard review.
Our investigator didnt think the complaint should be upheld. He said that the account User 
Agreement made it clear that the name on the account should have been in Miss Ds own 
name  not an abbreviated version. And he didnt think it was unreasonable for PayPal to 
place a hold on the account to make sure there were no payment reversals, before returning 
the funds to Miss D after 180 days if no claims have been made.
Miss D didn't agree so the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Having done so, Ive reached the same outcome as our investigators and for similar 
reasons. I know this will come as a disappointment to Miss D but Ive explained my reasons 
below.
I understand that Miss D prefers to keep her personal details private. But PayPals User 
Agreement specifies that her account must be held in her own name. Miss D says she 
provided her full name to PayPal but Ive seen her contact records with PayPal and I havent 
seen anything that makes me think Miss D ever attempted to change the name on the 
account. Miss D has said she added credit/debit cards with her full name on them so PayPal 
should have known that was her full name. But adding payment details isnt the same as 
changing the name on the account, so I dont think adding her full name as shown on her 
credit cards meant that PayPal should have assumed that was the name her account should 
be held in. And ultimately it was Miss Ds responsibility to provide PayPal with accurate 
information.
PayPal placed a restriction on her account and ultimately it has decided that this restriction 
should be permanent as the identity document Miss D provided doesnt match the name on 
her account. I realise this has inconvenienced Miss D but, as Miss D provided it with an 
incorrect name when she opened the account, I dont think it was unreasonable for PayPal 
to make that decision. Miss D has raised that PayPal has allowed her to use the account for 
several years before flagging this issue but I dont think that affects my decision here as 
ultimately, Miss D had always provided PayPal with incorrect information about her name 
and while I can understand her reasons for doing this (to protect her privacy), she still didnt 
act in accordance with the User Agreement she had accepted when she opened the 
account.
Miss D would like her funds returned to her and has told us that she believes PayPal has 
stolen those funds. PayPal has explained that it hasnt taken the money in her account 
permanently, it has put a hold on it. The User Agreement explains that PayPal is entitled to 
place a hold on Miss Ds funds  and in this case PayPal has specified that the hold was for 
180 days. As PayPal has taken the decision to put a permanent restriction on the account, I 
dont think it has done anything wrong by holding the funds  totalling around £45  in line 
with its User Agreement. And given the length of time thats now passed, Miss Ds funds are 
due to become available to her shortly.
Miss D says she was caused a great amount of stress through being unable to refund the 
£170 sent to her in September 2019. She says the third party made persistent telephone 
calls to her, which affected her mental health. I dont doubt that this was a very stressful time 
for Miss D. But Ive looked at the email she was sent from PayPal, which specifies that she 
was unable to send money or withdraw money. Miss D was able to refund that transaction 
on 8 October 2019 and I havent seen any evidence that PayPal prevented her from 
refunding the money before that date so I cant say PayPal made a mistake. 
Miss D has said she should be able to have a user name in order to protect her identity. I 
have asked PayPal whether this is possible or whether there is any other way of preventing 
other users from seeing her details when she makes a transaction. But PayPal has told this 
service that isnt something its able to do  and I think thats a decision for PayPal to make. 
But Miss D has raised some concerns with the Information Commissioners Office about this 
 and it will be for that office to decide whether PayPal has breached General Data 
Protection Regulations.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 March 2020.
