K821x#15complaint
Mr G says Elevate Credit International Limited trading as Sunny irresponsibly lent to him.
background
This complaint is about 40 instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr G between  
September 2015 and August 2018. Mr Gs borrowing history is set out in the appendix at the 
end of this decision.
Mr G says he was mis-sold loans by Sunny. He has told us that Sunny didnt carry out 
sufficient affordability checks to assess that he could reasonably  afford the loans. Sunny had 
failed to notice  that Mr Gs income had markedly changed for the worse  as it had failed to 
check his income regularly.
Sunny said for each  loan granted it had carried out adequate checks  which  it felt were 
proportionate and sufficient. It said that the amounts advanced were assessed as being 
affordable over the term of each loan. It also said the ability  to repay his loans  early  was not 
consistent with Mr G being in financial difficulty at the time and Mr G had never made them  
aware that his circumstances  had changed  or that his loan repayments were no longer 
affordable.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Gs complaint and thought  the loans from loan 6 to loan 40 
shouldnt have been given. Sunny did not fully agree with these recommendations but it said 
it would  uphold from loan 13 onwards  and offered  to put Mr G in the position hed have been 
in if he hadnt  taken out the loans. Mr G didnt respond to this offer and as the parties are not 
in agreement the complaint has been  passed  to me to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr G could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
Ref: DRN30292492refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Gs complaint.  Ive decided to uphold this complaint 
from loan 6 onwards.  I will explain why.
In relation to loans  1-5, I dont uphold this complaint. At this stage  I think  Sunny probably did 
enough. Sunny was in the earlier stages of its relationship with Mr G and I think it was 
reasonable to rely on what Mr G had told it in terms of his income  and outgoings. Mr G told 
Sunny that he had an income of £1,126.67 for loan 1 and £1,170.00 for loans  2,3,4 and 5 
and outgoings  of between £564.00 and £775.00. So, on the face of it theres  nothing  to 
make me think he wouldnt have been  able to pay his loans sustainably or that the loans 
were unaffordable compared with the disposable income hed declared.  And although Sunny 
could have made some further checks when Mr G took out loan 5, Ive seen nothing in the 
paperwork to suggest Mr G would  have had difficulty in repaying his loan at this point.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr G, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point  at which Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Gs case, I think that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr G was not managing  to repay  his loans 
sustainably. By the time Mr G had borrowed loan 6 he had taken out 6 loans in 
9 months. He also borrowed loan 6 on the same date he repaid loans 4 and 5 and for 
the same  amount.  So, Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr G 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Gs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Gs first loan was for £250.00.  Although Loan  6 was for £150.00 which was less 
than his first loan, Mr G still had not settled loan 3 when  he took out loan 6. On a 
number of occasions when Mr G took out his next loan, he still had multiple loans 
outstanding. So, it doesnt seem likely that Mr Gs need for cash was reducing which 
also points to him having a longer term need for funds. At this point  Sunny ought  to 
Ref: DRN30292493have known that Mr G was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary  shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing need. 
From  loan 6 onwards  Mr G was provided  with a new loan within  days of settling a 
previous one. Throughout the period of lending there were no gaps and on many  
occasions Mr G still had outstanding loans running concurrently which had not been  
repaid when he took out his next one. So I dont think its likely Mr G was using these 
instalment loans in the way they were intended  and was more likely relying on these 
loans as a longer-term means of finance.
Mr G wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Mr G had taken 
out 40 loans in almost  36 months. And Mr G had been  indebted  to Sunny for all that 
time. And although it was for a smaller amount  than his first loan, he still had loans 
37, 38, 39 and loan 40 outstanding  at that time and the amount he was borrowing 
overall had increased and had not consistently  reduced. Mr G had paid large 
amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an extended period. 
I think that Mr G lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Mr Gs ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept him/her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
So, Im also upholding  the complaint about loan 6 onwards and Sunny should put things 
right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Mr G loans 6-40.
It appears that there is an outstanding balance  in respect of loans 37-40. If that is the case 
and Sunny has sold the outstanding debts to a third party,  it should  buy these back if it is 
able to do so and then take the following steps. If Sunny is not able to buy the debts back, 
then it should  liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results  outlined below.
A) Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made by Mr G towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld  loans  (loans  6-36) without an outstanding balance,  not 
including anything Sunny  has already refunded.
B) Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual  payments made by Mr G 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr G originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Sunny should  remove all interest,  fees and charges from the balance on any upheld  
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments  made  by Mr G as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Mr G having made 
overpayments then Sunny should  refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* 
calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the 
Ref: DRN30292494date the complaint is settled. Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and 
B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans and any principal Sunny has 
already written-off.  If this results in a surplus, then the surplus  should  be paid to Mr G. 
However, if there is still an outstanding balance then Sunny should  try to agree an affordable 
repayment plan with Mr G. Sunny shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of 
principal Sunny has already written-off.
E) The overall pattern  of Mr Gs borrowing for loans 6 onwards means any information 
recorded about him is adverse, so Sunny should  remove these loans entirely from Mr Gs 
credit file. Sunny does  not have to remove outstanding loans 37,38,39 and loan 40 from 
Mr Gs credit file until these have been repaid, but Sunny should still remove any adverse 
information recorded about these  loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires you to deduct tax from this interest.  Sunny should  give 
Mr G a certificate showing how much tax youve deducted, if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Gs complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 March  2020.
