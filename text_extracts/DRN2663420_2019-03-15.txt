Miss B says CashEuroNet  UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to her irresponsibly.
background
Miss B had eight loans  with QuickQuid, several  of which were topped-up (as denoted below 
where the loans  have  a letter as well as a number). This is where Miss B borrowed extra 
funds during the course of the loan agreement. In total there were 18 lending decisions.

An adjudicator considered  Miss Bs complaint and recommended it be upheld in part. He 
didnt think QuickQuid shouldve approved  loan 5 or any of the subsequent  loans.  QuickQuid 
didnt agree, so the complaints been passed  to me to decide.  Ill only be looking at the 
complaint about  loans  5-8a as theres no ongoing  dispute about loans 1-4.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
Ref: DRN26634202QuickQuid didnt provide any new case-specific information in response to the adjudicators 
view. It said:
In response  to [the Financial Ombudsman  Service] FOS assessment which recommends 
QuickQuid uphold loans  which  were funded after March  2015, we regret  to inform  you that 
we cannot agree to FOS recommendations. Please note that in QuickQuid's initial response 
to FOS we provided detailed information  indicating why the loans were responsibly  lent to 
Ms [B]. Therefore, we kindly ask that you move this case  to the ombudsman queue  for a final 
decision. It also attached  a document setting out some information about  its general  lending 
processes. 
This was in addition to its original submissions to this service,  when it said:
I want  to reiterate that since 01 March  2015, QuickQuid implemented affordability review,  
which involved collecting  and validating income  and expense details from customers, in line 
with the FCA Handbook.  As such, we believe Ms [B]s loans issued post 2015 were 
affordable. Please note that we have escalated the broader concern of loans issued post 
February 2015 to your senior leadership and are in active discussion in effort  to reach a 
resolution.
This Service has responded to QuickQuid on this generic  argument  directly and through 
earlier final decisions. So I am not going to address this point here,  though I have considered 
it alongside everything else in making  my decision.  
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance  in 
how complaints are to be dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In 
particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling 
should: 
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Miss Bs complaint and what  both parties have  said 
about this.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Miss B borrowed the loans in question. Bearing in 
mind the rules and guidance set out in its Principles for Business (PRIN) and its Consumer 
Credit Sourcebook  (CONC),  I would expect a lenders affordability assessment to vary with 
circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations here because,  as before, I would 
expect QuickQuid to be conversant with these through previous ombudsman decisions,  
particularly recent decisions, which set these  out in detail.)  
Ref: DRN26634203In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks:
-the higher the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
I understand that throughout  the period of lending QuickQuid recorded Miss Bs net monthly 
income as £1,500. It also recorded information about her monthly living expenses;  the total 
of these was £425  for loan 5-6a and £725 for loans 7-8a. The increase was entirely  due to a 
£300 increase  in Miss Bs declared housing expenses from £425 to £725  a month. 
Throughout the period of lending, Miss B said her existing credit commitments  were £50 a 
month. Deducting Miss Bs declared  expenditure from her declared income would  leave her 
with disposable  income of £1,075  for loans 5-6a and £775 for loans 7-8a. 
QuickQuid, however, has said its own estimate of Miss Bs disposable  income (EDI) was 
different because it was influenced by factors including national averages  and credit report 
data. The EDI figures QuickQuid arrived at were:
Loan 5  £599
Loan 6  £1,007
Loan 7  £775
Loan 8  £395
QuickQuid hasnt explained how it arrived at these figures, or provided any of the underlying  
credit report  data it says was a factor. At times  for example  loan 7  the figure  appears  to 
just be a simple deduction  of declared expenditure from income. But at other  times, as with 
loans 5 and 8, there is a significant difference between Miss Bs declared disposable income  
and QuickQuids estimate. Without knowing  how QuickQuid arrived  at the above  figures,  
I cant say whether they reflect  a proportionate check.
But in any event, I dont  think  the affordability  checks QuickQuid undertook were 
proportionate in the circumstances of loans approved from 9 December 2016.  Loan 5 was 
the ninth advance to Miss B in about six months  and the amounts Miss B was borrowing 
(when top-ups  are taken into account) were steadily increasing; Miss Bs first loan was for 
£100 and her fourth a total of £350. So I think there were signs Miss Bs need  to borrow 
money was not due to a short-term cash flow problem,  but something  more regular. 
The repeated need to borrow  money with only very short-gaps between  the loans indicates  
that Miss B may have  been struggling  to settle  the loans in a way which was sustainable  
so proportionate checks ought  to have reflected that risk. And in Miss Bs circumstances, 
I think it wouldve been proportionate for QuickQuid to ask her for some  form of proof of 
income and expenditure before approving  loan 5 and the subsequent loans and top-ups.
As QuickQuid didnt do this, Ive taken into account information from Miss Bs bank 
statements, to establish what proportionate  checks would likely have shown. In the absence 
of any other  information,  I think  its perfectly reasonably to rely on them.
Ref: DRN26634204Our adjudicator set out in detail what its likely  QuickQuid wouldve seen had it looked at 
evidence of Miss Bs income and expenditure. In short, he thought  Miss B had insufficient  
disposable income to sustainably  repaid the loans approved from 9 December 2016.
To give some examples, at the time of loan 5 Miss Bs income, including  cash payments she 
was given towards household bills, was around £1,700. Her normal  living costs were about  
£1,140  including around £600 for her rent. Miss B was also paying regular creditors  a little 
over £50 a month and short-term creditors £160.  So her disposable income was a little over 
£300. So I dont  think the highest payments  of £248 or £342 (after  the first top-up) wouldve 
looked sustainable to QuickQuid. After  the second  top-up, the highest  repayment to 
QuickQuid increased  to £499.  Miss Bs repayments to other short-term creditors had also 
increased, so the second top-up wouldve also looked  unaffordable.
Having reviewed Miss Bs bank  statements for the period of time covering loans 6-8, Im 
satisfied that she didnt have enough  disposable  income to sustainably repay these loans.  
For loan 6 her disposable  income was around  £500 and for loan 7 around  £450. By the time 
of loan 8, Miss B was repaying as much as £560  a month to at least  five other short-term 
creditors. This left her with no, or insufficient, disposable income  to repay QuickQuid.  So 
QuickQuid loans 6-8 were not affordable  to her and I dont think it wouldve approved  them, 
had it carried out proportionate checks.
Id add that its possible I could also find, from the pattern of lending  alone, that QuickQuid 
ought to have realised there was a problem.  As this service  has set out on its website and in 
other decisions QuickQuid is aware  of, we consider there may come a point in a chain of 
lending where  the lending  history  and pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that the 
lending was unsustainable. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Bs case, I think that this point was probably 
reached by loan 6. By this point it was clear the amounts Miss B was borrowing were  
generally increasing, and QuickQuid  ought  to have realised it was likely her indebtedness  
was increasing unsustainably. Miss B wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she 
owed QuickQuid. And she was in effect  paying  large  amounts  of interest to service her debt 
over an extended period.
Its likely  Miss B lost out because the number of loans  had the effect of unfairly prolonging 
her indebtedness  by allowing her to take expensive credit over an extended period of time. 
And the sheer  number of loans was likely  to have had negative implications on Miss Bs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
But as Ive already found  proportionate checks would likely have shown QuickQuid the loans 
were unaffordable,  I dont need to make a definitive finding on whether the pattern of lending  
alone should also have alerted QuickQuid to a problem.
In summary,  I dont think QuickQuids affordability checks were proportionate for loans 5-8a. 
And I think if QuickQuid had carried out proportionate checks, it wouldve likely seen that 
these loans were not sustainably  affordable for Miss B. So Im upholding Miss Bs complaint 
about loans 5-8a.
Ref: DRN26634205putting things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Miss B paid on loans 5-8a
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when she paid them (if she did) 
to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  loans 5-8a from Miss Bs credit  history
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid must give 
Miss B a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the steps set 
out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 April 2019.
