K821x#15complaint
Mr W has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr W says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Mr W took out 9 instalment loans from Sunny between November 2016 
and June 2017. Ive enclosed a summary  of Mr Ws borrowing with Sunny, based  on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found  in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan number  4 onwards. Sunny  originally said it hadnt done anything  wrong  
but it later offered  to partially settle Mr Ws complaint. He didnt agree so the complaint has 
come to me for an ombudsmans final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice, on our website. Ive followed this approach when  thinking  about Mr Ws 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that Mr W 
could repay  all the loans he was given  in a sustainable manner. These  checks ought to have 
taken into account  a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
Ref: DRN97176022whether Mr W could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr W could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr W including assessing his income, expenditure and creditworthiness.  It says all this 
information showed that he would  be able to make the loan repayments  he was committing 
to. Ive thought  about this and also looked  at the overall pattern  of lending history  with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some  point, 
Sunny should  have  realised that it shouldnt  have provided any further loans to Mr W. 
Ive also taken account of what Ive said above, about the length of the lending  relationship,  
and applied  it to the circumstances of loans 1  3 in this case. And I dont think its clear  
enough that what Sunny would have would have  seen,  from its checks,  suggested loans 1  
3 were either  unaffordable  for Mr W or that the information from the checks it carried out 
undermined the income or outgoings Mr W had himself declared. 
I accept that Mr W may have already been  finding  managing his money  quite difficult  at this 
point. However, theres no clear  record that the type or depth of credit checks  that were  
carried out at that time would have exposed  these issues. So Im afraid I dont agree that 
Sunny knew its lending was unsustainable.  I therefore dont uphold this part of the complaint.
However, I think from the point of loan number 4 the situation was different and Sunny 
should have considered whether Mr W was having  difficulties  managing  money. For 
example, this was his fourth Sunny loan in just 6 weeks and Mr W had applied for it whilst all 
3 previous Sunny loans were still outstanding. Consequently, his overall monthly repayment 
amount was also increasing. There was also evidence that Mr W wasnt making  any in-roads 
to his debts because the amount he asked  to borrow at the point of loan 4 wasnt reducing.
I think all this shows Mr W was experiencing financial difficulties and it should have caused 
Sunny to look much further into his financial affairs. If it had done  this, it would have exposed 
Mr W was also borrowing  similar loans from elsewhere; further evidence he was 
relying heavily  on short-term lending. Loan 5 shows a very similar  pattern and the amount 
borrowed increased to the highest  amount so far. With this information, I dont think  Sunny 
ought to have lent him the money  for loans  4 or 5. I dont  think  it was responsible to do so.
In addition to the above,  from the point of loan 6 onwards,  there was an additional and clear 
pattern of repeated lending evident  in my view. Loan  6 was his sixth loan in as many months 
and immediately followed the closure  of loan 5. Again, there was no evidence Mr W was 
getting to grips with his indebtedness. So there was an obvious  dependency on high-
interest, short-term lending. So Im also upholding Mr Ws complaint in respect of loans 6, 7, 
8, and 9 as well. Sunny repeatedly lent to Mr W in an unsustainable manner because:
 
Ref: DRN97176023these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging his indebtedness by allowing him to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Mr W borrowed was likely to have  had negative  
implications on his ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market  
for these high-cost  loans.
putting things right
In order to put things  right for Mr W, Sunny should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr W paid on loans 4 - 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information  recorded  on Mr Ws credit  file in relation  to loans 4 
and 5;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6, 7, 8, and 9 should be completely 
removed from Mr Ws credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr W a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I partially uphold  Mr Ws complaint and direct  Elevate Credit International Limited to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 5 April 2020.
