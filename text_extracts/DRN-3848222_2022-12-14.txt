The complaint
Mr M complains about how BMW Financial Services(GB) Limited (BMWFS) has 
administered his hire purchase agreement (agreement), in particular its pursuit from him of 
a sum he says he shouldnt have to pay.
What happened
On 16 March 2020 Mr M entered into an agreement with BMWFS for the acquisition of a 
new car. Under the terms of this agreement, everything else being equal, Mr M undertook to 
make an advance payment of £4,750 followed by 46 monthly payments of £447.97 and a 
final payment of £16,647.22  making a total sum repayable of £42,451.81 at an APR of 
3.9%.
In September 2020 Mr M took the decision to settle the agreement early, as was his right.
On 28 September 2020 BMWFS credited Mr Ms agreement with the sum of £32,363.33 paid 
by Mr M. This payment took Mr Ms agreement balance into a credit position of £447.97.
On 7 October 2020 BMWFS sent Mr M a letter saying Thank you for your payment for the 
agreement shown above. We can confirm that you no longer have any obligations under this 
agreement.
On 19 October 2020 BMWFS says it refunded back to Mr M (to a nominated bank account) 
the sum of £447.97 after a direct debit indemnity claim made against it by him, or somebody 
representing him. This refund took Mr Ms agreement balance to £0.
On 9 December 2020 BMWFS says it refunded back to Mr M (to a nominated bank account) 
the sum of £447.97 after a direct debit indemnity claim made against it by him, or somebody 
representing him. This refund took Mr Ms agreement balance into a debit position of 
£447.97.
Between December 2020 and September 2022 substantial correspondence passed between 
BMWFS and Mr M, with BMWFS seeking the recovery from Mr M the sum of £477.97 
(together with reasons why) and with Mr M submitting reasons to BMWFS why he shouldnt 
have to pay the same.
As BMWFS was unsuccessful in obtaining from Mr M the sum of £477.97 it says it marked 
his agreement, with one or more third party credit reference agencies, as being in arrears.
Mr Ms complaint was considered by one of our investigators who came to the view that 
BMWFS was entitled to seek recovery, from Mr M, the sum of £477.97 and it had done 
nothing wrong in recording with one or more third party credit reference agencies the 
(adverse) information it had.
Mr M didnt agree with the investigators view, so his complaint has been passed to me for 
review and decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
First, I would like to point out Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill concentrate my 
comments on what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point, its not 
because Ive failed to take it on board and think about it but because I dont think I need to 
comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right outcome. 
I would also point out that where the information Ive got is incomplete, unclear, or 
contradictory, Ive to base my decision on the balance of probabilities and that Im satisfied 
that Mr M has had more than enough time to provide our service with everything he would 
like us to take into account.
Im satisfied that after Mr M paid BMWFS £32,363.33 his agreement balance was placed 
into a credit position of £477.97, equivalent to one months payment, and this sum was due 
and owing to him by BMWFS.
But before BMWFS could action a refund back to Mr M it says it received a direct debit 
indemnity claim for £447.97 (which it met and which took Mr Ms agreement balance to £0) 
followed by a second direct debit indemnity claim for £477.97 (which it met and which took 
Mr Ms agreement balance into a debit position of £447.97).
BMWFS has provided our service with both direct debit indemnity claims (of £447.97). And 
Im satisfied that BMWFS acted correctly in deciding to meet these claims, that it met them, 
and it accounted for meeting them correcting in its books, resulting in a debit balance (owing 
by Mr M) of £477.97.
And because of the above and because of Mr Ms decision not to pay BMWFS the sum of 
£477.97 I can confirm that Im satisfied that BMWFS acted both fairly and reasonably in 
marking the agreement, with one or more third party credit reference agencies, as in arrears.
For the sake of completeness, I would add that Im satisfied that BMWFSs letter dated 
7 October 2020 didnt prevent BMWFS from seeking the sum of £477.97 from Mr M at a later 
date. In my view this letter was written on the assumption that no direct debit indemnity 
claims would be made after 7 October 2020 and should be read with such an assumption in 
mind.
Its my understanding that Mr M says he only made one direct indemnity claim and he hasnt 
had the benefit of £477.97 twice. But if this is what has happened then this is something 
Mr M needs to take up with the bank in question. 
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 11 January 2023.
