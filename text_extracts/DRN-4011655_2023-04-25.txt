The complaint
On behalf his business (C) Mr B complains that in 2021 One Sure Insurance Limited mis-
sold a motor traders insurance policy to cover Cs vehicles.
What happened
Mr B had bought policies for C through One Sure since 2015. In March 2021, One Sure 
recommended that Cs business should be placed with insurer M. The policy was renewed 
in March 2022. Shortly afterwards, insurer M cancelled the policy. It said it hadnt received 
the evidence of trading it required, despite requests. Mr B has made a separate complaint 
about what happened in 2022. But he thinks the policy with insurer M was mis-sold by One 
Sure in 2021 and that any claim made on it would have been declined. So he wants the 
premium for the year to be refunded.
One of our investigators reviewed the complaint Mr B made to One Sure. He noted that in 
2015 One Sure had established that C expected no more than 10 sales each year, with an 
annual turnover of no more than £15,000. He was satisfied that in 2021 One Sure had 
placed Cs  business with an insurer that had a minimum turnover of less than that stated by 
Mr B, at £10,000 per year. So he didnt think the policy was mis-sold. Mr B said that (due to 
the pandemic) C had made no sales in 2020, but that One Sure didnt ask him about any 
changes. The investigator said Mr B had the chance to inform One Sure of any changes 
before he agreed to the policy for C in 2021. He didnt think it had mis-sold the policy. 
Mr B said as One Sure recommended a new policy for C in 2021, it had a duty to assess Cs 
requirements then, to ensure the policy was suitable. He said the cancellation in 2022 
showed the policy wasnt suitable, as insurer Ms expectations about Cs turnover were far 
greater than Cs expected turnover (as set out by Mr B to One Sure in 2015). Mr B said later 
that his expectations about Cs turnover remained the same in 2021 and 2022. As there was 
no agreement, the complaint was passed to me for review. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres extensive correspondence on this file between Mr B and the investigator, but much 
of it relates to what happened in 2022. I wont be addressing that here, as this complaint only 
relates to whether the policy was mis-sold in 2021. 
When the investigator told Mr B that the complaint about the 2021 policy was going to be 
reviewed by an ombudsman, Mr B clarified what his complaint was about. He said he 
thought Cs business was placed with insurer M in 2021 without One Sure having checked 
that the level of trading insurer M required was commensurate with Cs normal level.  
 
The sale in 2021 was an advised sale, so One Sure had a duty to ensure the policy was right 
for C. The policys Statement of Fact showed that the estimated annual turnover for C was 
£15,000. Although Mr B had provided that estimate in 2015, he says it was still Cs target in 
2021. Insurer M set out a minimum annual target of £10,000  and it didnt require a set 
number of sales. I think the turnover it was looking for was commensurate with Cs normal 
level of trading. So I think it was reasonable for One Sure to conclude that the policy was 
suitable for Cs needs in 2021 and to recommend it. It sent Mr B all the policy documents 
and asked him to read them carefully and to contact it if there were any changes. I think that 
shows he could have raised any concerns with One Sure before the policy was set up. 
The pandemic had a huge impact on sales everywhere during 2020, but Mr B says he 
expected sales to pick up in 2021. Unfortunately, it didnt happen, and C made no sales that 
year either. He says One Sure should have checked with him about Cs sales in 2020 before 
it recommended the new policy to him. But I dont think what happened in 2020 is relevant. 
When the policy started in 2021 Mr B thought C would meet its usual target for the year. It 
seems that, given his confidence about likely sales that year, he didnt think it was necessary 
to call One Sure to discuss the figures set out in the renewal documents for 2021. 
Insurer M didnt query the lack of turnover during the 2021-2022 policy year, but Mr B has 
assumed that it wouldnt have dealt with any claim made that year, as C didnt trade. Theres 
nothing to show that would have happened  and insurer M agreed to cover C during the 
next policy year, knowing about the previous lack of trading.   
I know Mr B will be disappointed with my decision, but as I dont think he has shown that 
One Sure mis-sold the policy for C in 2021, I cant uphold his complaint.   
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask C to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 May 2023.
