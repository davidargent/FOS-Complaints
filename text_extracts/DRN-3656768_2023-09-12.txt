The complaint
Mr and Mrs H complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid for some holiday club membership points. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
I understand that Mr and Mrs H had bought holiday club membership points from a holiday 
company six times between January 2000 and September 2015. They then entered into a 
purchase agreement to buy 5,000 more holiday club membership points from the holiday 
company in March 2016. The purchase price of the additional points was £4,199 and they 
entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank for a loan of that amount. 
They agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of £60.73 to Shawbrook Bank. 
Mr and Mrs Hs representative made claims, on behalf of Mr and Mrs H, to Shawbrook Bank 
under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in June 2021 about the 
purchase that Mr and Mrs H had made in March 2016. The claims included that: the points 
were mis-sold and misrepresented to Mr and Mrs H; the terms of the agreement were so 
egregious so as to be unfair and the payment of commission was hidden from view; no credit 
or affordability checks were carried out to establish whether Mr and Mrs H could afford the 
purchase; the holiday company breached the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and 
Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 and the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading 
Regulations 2008; Mr and Mrs H were pressured into entering into the loan agreement; and 
their relationship with Shawbrook Bank was unfair.
Shawbrook Bank set out in detail the reasons that it said that it was unable to uphold their 
claims including that: it was satisfied that Mr and Mrs H were willing to make an informed 
decision based on the information that they received in March 2016; appropriate checks for 
the type and amount of credit were carried out; and Mr and Mrs H had agreed that the 
holiday company was entitled to receive a commission in respect of the credit brokered (but 
the level of that commission wasnt such that it would create an unfair relationship). 
Mr and Mrs H werent satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. 
Their complaint form says that: Shawbrook Bank paid a commission to the holiday company 
which wasnt declared to them; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment 
of their ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured them into entering the contracts and used 
aggressive commercial practices to pressure them; and the product was misrepresented to 
them; all rendering the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140. It said that the claim 
should also be considered under section 75.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Hs complaint should be upheld as he 
didnt think that Shawbrook Banks decision to turn down their claims was unfair or 
unreasonable. He wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale 
and he said that he hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr and 
Mrs H and Shawbrook Bank was unfair and that he wasnt persuaded that a court would 
reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He thought that it was unlikely that a 
court would find that the failure to disclose commission created an unfair relationship and he 
said that he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable 
for Mr and Mrs H. 
Mr and Mrs Hs representative, on behalf of Mr and Mrs H, has asked for this complaint to be 
considered by an ombudsman. It has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses and a witness statement from Mr and 
Mrs H. It has also raised its serious concerns about the way that the finance was sold to 
them. It says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
Mr and Mrs H were sold a product with little or no benefit or value as non-members 
regularly holidayed at and were given easy access to the resorts without requiring to 
first purchase a membership or pay annual maintenance fees and theres little or no 
secondary market for the points;
the points were an in perpetuity contract with unlimited liability for management 
charges which was concealed at the point of purchase; and
Mr and Mrs H were pressurised into entering into an agreement on that day and were 
prevented from making an informed consumer decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Hs complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
I understand that Mr and Mrs H had had bought holiday club membership points from 
the holiday company six times between January 2000 and September 2015 and they 
then signed the purchase agreement in March 2016 to buy an additional 5,000 
points; 
Mr and Mrs H also signed the loan agreement and Shawbrook Bank has referred to 
other documents that it says that they signed at that time including a right of 
withdrawal form, a customer compliance statement, a key information document, a 
joint application form, pre-contract credit information and an adequate explanation 
document  but copies of those other documents havent been provided;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative made claims to Shawbrook Bank in June 2021 under 
sections 75 and 140A and Mr and Mrs H then made a complaint to this service;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Hs claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Shawbrook Banks response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
the June 2021 letter said that the holiday company represented to Mr and Mrs H that: 
they would be able to use the additional points to book their preferred holidays and 
they would also give them access to luxurious resorts with five star accommodation 
all over the world, they would guarantee weeks' worth of holidays each year; and 
they would solve their current issues with booking  and it says that those representations were false and misleading, were made for the sole purpose of 
inducing Mr and Mrs H to purchase the points and, were it not for the 
misrepresentations, they wouldnt have purchased the points;
Mr and Mrs H say in their witness statement that they were told in March 2016 that 
the additional points would allow them to holiday at a wider and more luxurious range 
of resorts and would allow their family to use points to holiday and that they were 
promised a lot by the holiday company when they made their purchases but the 
promises of exclusivity havent come to fruition as non-members are able to book 
holidays at the resorts;
Shawbrook Bank says that the holiday companys records from the time of sale show 
that one of Mr and Mrs Hs motivations for purchasing the additional points was to 
gain access to one of the gold membership benefits which was accommodation 
upgrades and that Mr and Mrs H were able to change their booking to a larger 
accommodation size for a nominal cash sum on a greater number of occasions, and 
at a lower cost, than was possible for silver members;
Mr and Mrs H also say in their witness statement that they often made complaints to 
the staff about the facilities at the resorts but Shawbrook Bank says that the holiday 
company has stated that theres nothing in its records to suggest that Mr and Mrs H 
have experienced difficulties securing their desired reservations using their points nor 
that they purchased the additional points to assuage any concerns that they might 
have been having about availability;
Mr and Mrs H have provided no other evidence or information to show that they 
complained to the holiday company about the issues that they say were 
misrepresented to them (including the lack of exclusivity of the resorts and the range 
of resorts available) and none of Mr and Mrs H and their representative has provided 
a detailed account of the circumstances in which the alleged misrepresentations 
were made, the conversations that took place or the information that was provided to 
them;
Shawbrook Banks has described the purchases of points from the holiday company 
that Mr and Mrs H made between January 2000 and September 2015 and Mr and 
Mrs H say that they were promised a lot by the holiday company when they made 
their purchases  but they made purchases in January and November 2000, March 
and November 2003, January 2004 and September 2015 and Im not persuaded that 
its likely that they would have continued to buy more points if the promises that had 
been made to them by the holiday company hadnt been true;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
that Mr and Mrs H bought in March 2016 were misrepresented to them by the holiday 
company or that they were induced into entering into that purchase agreement by 
any such misrepresentations;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that commission was paid between Shawbrook 
Bank and the holiday company which wasnt disclosed to Mr and Mrs H which 
created an unfair relationship but Shawbrook Bank says that Mr and Mrs H had 
agreed that the holiday company was entitled to receive a commission in respect of 
the credit brokered and the level of that commission wasnt such that it would create 
an unfair relationship;
Ive not been provided with any other evidence to show the amount of commission 
that Shawbrook Bank paid to the holiday company but from what this service has 
seen across the industry, when commission was paid it tended to be low and of less 
than 15% and Im satisfied that Shawbrook Bank wouldnt have breached any duty in 
making any such payment  nor was it under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these circumstances - and I dont consider that the 
level of commission that was normally paid in this type of situation would have been 
sufficiently high to mean that Shawbrook Bank should have appreciated that not 
disclosing the amount of the commission to Mr and Mrs H risked the relationship 
being unfair under section 140A;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs H asked Shawbrook Bank for any 
information about the commission that it paid to the holiday company until their 
representatives letter to Shawbrook Bank in June 2021  as theyd entered into the 
loan agreement in March 2016 I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them 
to have raised any concerns about the commission that was paid sooner than that;
Mr and Mrs Hs complaint form says that no credit or affordability checks were carried 
out to establish whether Mr and Mrs H could afford the purchase but Shawbrook 
Bank says that it carries out checks in line with its regulatory obligations and it uses 
lending industry standard products, including credit searches and information 
provided to it by prospective borrowers, to assess the likelihood of them defaulting on 
their repayment obligations and of them becoming overindebted  and that its 
satisfied that these checks were appropriate for the type and amount of credit 
provided to Mr and Mrs H;
it also says that the holiday companys records show that Mr and Mrs H were going 
to use their pension cover to make their monthly payments;
none of Mr and Mrs H and their representative had provided detailed evidence about 
Mr and Mrs Hs financial position in March 2016 or to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for them at that time;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs H asked Shawbrook Bank for any 
information about its credit or affordability checks before June 2021  as the loan 
was made to them in March 2016 I consider that it would be reasonable to expect 
them to have raised any concerns about the credit or affordability checks before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that a loan with a monthly 
repayment of £60.73 wasnt affordable for Mr and Mrs H when it was made to them in 
March 2016 or that the loan was mis-sold to them;
Mr and Mrs Hs complaint form also says that the holiday company unduly pressured 
them into entering the contracts and used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure them  but Mr and Mrs H had bought membership points from the holiday 
company six times between January 2000 and September 2015 so they ought to 
have been aware of the sales practices that would be used by the holiday company 
before they bought the additional membership points in March 2016;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs H contacted either the holiday 
company or Shawbrook Bank about the way that the membership points were sold to 
them in March 2016 until their representatives June 2021 letter to Shawbrook Bank 
and if they felt that they were unduly pressured into entering into the contracts and 
didnt want to buy the additional membership points I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have raised their concerns soon after theyd signed the 
contracts;
Mr and Mrs H had signed the loan agreement which clearly set out their right to 
withdraw from that agreement without giving a reason within 14 days and Shawbrook 
Bank says that they also signed a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice 
that could be given to withdraw from the purchase agreement  but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that they contacted either the holiday company or Shawbrook Bank 
to withdraw from the agreements within any applicable withdrawal period;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs H were 
unduly pressured into entering into the purchase agreement or loan agreement or 
that the holiday company used unacceptably aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure them;
Mr and Mrs Hs representative says that the membership points were an in 
perpetuity contract with unlimited liability for management charges which was 
concealed at the point of purchase and it has provided a generic submission from 
counsel about the holiday company and the unfair terms that it uses but it would be 
for a court to determine whether or not any of the terms in those agreements were 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
continued in perpetuity and the purchase agreement that Mr and Mrs H signed said 
that the structure of the membership was governed by the articles of association and 
the associated legal documentation and that they should carefully read their 
legal/governing documents booklet and the key information document;
Mr and Mrs H had owned membership points since January 2000 so I consider it to 
be reasonable to conclude that they knew that theyd be required to pay 
management charges for the additional membership points that they bought in March 
2016  and they say in their witness statement that their maintenance fees have 
increased substantially over the years and, due to their retirement and reduced 
income, they feel that they are no longer financially viable;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr and Mrs H and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs H and 
Shawbrook Bank;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of any applicable regulations for which Shawbrook Bank would be liable under 
section 75 or 140A;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Hs 
relationship with Shawbrook Bank was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs H 
and Shawbrook Bank in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs H for the issues that theyve had with their membership 
points but I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to the claims that had been 
made to it was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Shawbrook Bank to refund to Mr and Mrs H any of the money that theyve paid for 
the membership points, to cancel their loan agreement, to pay them any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Hs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs H to 
accept or reject my decision before 10 October 2023.
