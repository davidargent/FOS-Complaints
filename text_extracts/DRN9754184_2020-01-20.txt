8 31/08/2017 02/09/2017 6 £250.00 £74.40
Our adjudicator partially upheld Miss Ss complaint and thought the loans from loan 6 
onwards shouldnt have been  given because the overall pattern of Miss Ss borrowing 
indicated she was reliant on these loans and the borrowing was becoming  unsustainable. 
Sunny disagreed and said it had done robust  checks on Miss S  including  reviewing reports  
from credit  reference agencies  and these  checks did not raise any concerns. 
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally it was passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all the relevant rules,  guidance  and good  
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss S could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could consider a number of different 
things, such as how much was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers 
income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  
checks might be reasonable  and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
Ref: DRN97541842the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss S could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments  were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all the arguments, evidence and information provided  in this context 
and what this all means for Miss Ss complaint. Having done so, I am partially  upholding the 
complaint. Ill explain  why. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Miss Ss complaint about loans 1 to 5. Miss S hasnt provided  
any further evidence  or arguments for us to consider, so I wont  be making any further  
findings on these  loans because they no longer  appear to be in dispute. 
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Miss S, with a view to seeing  
if there was a point  at which  Sunny  should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should  have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Miss Ss case, I think that this point was reached by loan 6. I say 
this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Miss S was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Miss S had taken out 6 loans within just under 6 months and often 
had more than one loan already running  with Sunny. So, it should  have realised it 
was more likely than not Miss S was having to borrow further to cover the hole 
repaying her previous  loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Ss 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
From  loan 6 onwards  Miss S was provided with a new loan within  weeks  of taking out 
a previous one. 
Ref: DRN97541843Miss S wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan 8 was 
taken out 9 months after Miss Ss first. And it was for a larger  amount. Miss S had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect; service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Miss S lost out because  Sunny  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss Ss indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
The number of loans  and the length  of time over which Miss S borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Miss Ss ability to access  mainstream credit and 
so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss S paid on loans 6, 7 and 8;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6, 7 and 8 should  be removed from 
Miss Ss credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Miss S a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss Ss complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 20 February  2020.
