The complaint
Mrs S complains that John Lewis Financial Services Limited wont refund to her the money 
that she paid for a kitchen. 
What happened
Mrs S entered into a contract with a kitchen supplier for it to design and supply a 
replacement kitchen. She used her John Lewis Finance credit card in February 2019 to pay 
a holding deposit of £1,000 to the supplier and she made further payments of £3,849.80, 
£14,549.37 and £270 to the supplier by other means. The kitchen units and components 
were delivered to Mrs S in April 2019 and the kitchen was then installed.
Mrs S complained to the supplier about some issues with the kitchen in June 2019 and she 
claimed a refund of the cost of the kitchen from John Lewis Finance under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 in October 2019. She provided an inspection report on the 
kitchen from a furniture consultant. John Lewis Finance said that the contract was for supply 
only and the tradesmen that had completed the installation didnt form part of Mrs Ss 
contract with the supplier. It said that shed paid the tradesmen in cash so those payments 
couldnt be considered under section 75. It said that it was unable to determine a breach of 
contract or a misrepresentation as Mrs S had received the service that she paid for. Mrs S 
wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld. She said that the 
installation of the kitchen didnt form part of the contract that Mrs S had with the supplier and 
she paid for the installation separately so any faults or complaints regarding the installation 
couldnt be considered under section 75. She was satisfied that the supplier had fulfilled its 
obligations under the contract so she couldnt say that there was a breach of contract by the 
supplier or recommend that John Lewis Finance should do any more.
Mrs S has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has responded 
in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
the kitchen did not fit the space of her kitchen and the drawings show incorrect 
measurements;
the units for the fridge-freezer, oven and microwave are so large that the door 
architrave had to be cut down for them to fit and there appears to have been some 
mismeasurement;
the photos of the kitchen design are not as the kitchen is and give the effect that the 
oven and microwave are not as high as they are;
the supplier requested that she pay the fitters separately;
the worktops arent level and have fine gaps along the wall edge;
the supplier should have either advised that additional extraction was required for the 
hob or supplied a vented hob;
there was no urgency on her part to have the kitchen delivered quickly; and
the supplier showed a lack of reasonable skill care and diligence.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mrs Ss complaint about John Lewis Finance, I must be satisfied 
that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the kitchen supplier 
and that John Lewis Finances response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or 
reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Ss claim under section 75 
as only a court would be able to do that;
both the supplier and Mrs S have provided detailed evidence, including photos, about 
this complaint which Ive considered but I will only be commenting on the evidence 
that I consider to be necessary for me to make a decision - and where the evidence 
is incomplete, inconclusive or contradictory, Ive made my decision on the basis of 
what I consider is most likely to have happened in light of the available evidence and 
the wider circumstances;
Mrs S used her John Lewis Finance credit card to pay the holding deposit of £1,000 
for the kitchen in February 2019;
later that month she signed a sales contract with the supplier for it to supply the 
kitchen for a total price of £19,399.17  the contract says, in capital letters, supply 
only  private installation and immediately above her signature it says: The 
customer confirms his/her offer made for [the] goods in accordance with the terms 
specified above and overleaf; 
I consider that the contract was clearly only for the supply of the kitchen and that the 
installation was being paid for separately and didnt form part of Mrs Ss contract with 
the supplier;
Mrs S paid the deposit due under the sales contract using her John Lewis Finance 
credit card and Ive seen no evidence to show that she paid for the installation using 
credit provided by John Lewis Finance so I dont consider that John Lewis Finance 
has any liability to Mrs S under section 75 for the installation of the kitchen;
the supplier has provided evidence to show that Mrs S was involved in the design of 
the kitchen and that she signed-off on the design  it also says that the oven was 
located at the height requested by Mrs S so that she didnt have to bend over 
because of her bad back and that she wanted the microwave to be above the oven;
although Mrs S is clearly unhappy with the design of the kitchen, Im not persuaded 
that theres enough evidence to show that the kitchen has been designed incorrectly, 
that it doesnt fit the space of her kitchen, that the supplier measured the space 
incorrectly or that it failed to use reasonable care and skill in designing the kitchen;
the kitchen units and components were delivered to Mrs S  there was an issue with 
one of the units but it wasnt going to be visible when the kitchen was installed so 
Mrs S accepted it and there was an issue with one of the doors which the supplier 
agreed to replace;the supplier says that it quality checked the kitchen after the worktops had been fitted 
and that Mrs S didnt raise any concerns about the installation of the kitchen at that 
time - but she contacted it in June 2019 and said that the floor had been damaged 
during the installation and that the supplier should pay for it to be replaced;
if there were other issues with the kitchen, I consider that it would be reasonable to 
expect Mrs S to have referred to those issues when she contacted the supplier about 
the damage to the floor in June 2019;
she then contacted the supplier again in September 2019 about eleven issues with 
the kitchen and claimed a refund of £6,242 - and when she made her claim to John 
Lewis Finance in October 2019 she listed 32 issues with the kitchen;
Mrs S arranged for the kitchen to be inspected in November 2019  the inspector is 
clearly an expert in upholstery and furniture but Ive seen no evidence to show that 
hes an expert in kitchen design  but Ive taken account of the findings that he made;
one of the issues that he identified was that the worktops are out of alignment  
Mrs S had raised eleven issues with the kitchen in the letter that she sent to the 
supplier in September 2019 but she hadnt complained about the worktops being out 
of alignment;
the supplier says that Mrs S signed-off the installation of the worktops as satisfactory 
and has provided photos of the kitchen with the worktops installed  but it says that 
she should contact it or the stone fabricator that provided a warranty on the worktop 
installation about any issues with the worktops;
I dont consider that the supplier was responsible for any damage to the floor and Im 
not persuaded that there enough evidence to show that the supplier failed to comply 
with building regulations relating to the design of the kitchen or the hob or that it 
should have advised Mrs S that another extraction option was required;
I consider that the supplier supplied the kitchen units and components to Mrs S in 
accordance with the design that had been agreed with her and as specified in the 
contract and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier in connection with the 
supply of the kitchen units and components to Mrs S;
Mrs S is clearly unhappy with the kitchen and I can understand her disappointment 
that the kitchen isnt what she expected but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that thats the result of a breach of contract by the supplier or that 
John Lewis Finance has acted incorrectly in response to her claim; and
I sympathise with Mrs S for the issues that she has with the kitchen and the 
experience that shes described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require John Lewis Finance to refund to her any of the 
money that she paid for the kitchen, to pay her any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to her complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 November 2022.
