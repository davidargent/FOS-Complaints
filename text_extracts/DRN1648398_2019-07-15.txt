K821x#15complaint
Mr G complains that National  Westminster Bank  Plc (NatWest)  wrongly  recorded  a marker 
against his name with a fraud  prevention agency,  CIFAS, that indicated hed committed  
fraud on his credit card account and then failed  to remove it in a timely way.
Background
Mr G held a credit card account with NatWest that in early 2013 had a credit  limit of several 
thousand pounds.
On or around 7 February  2013 Mr G carried out a money transfer from his NatWest  credit 
card account. This, plus the money  transfer  fee, meant his debit balance  was within  a few 
hundred pounds of his credit limit. 
On 8 February Mr G made  a cheque out to reduce the balance  on his NatWest credit card 
account. The cheque  was drawn  on his joint account with another bank, which  Ill call 
Bank 1. On 14 and 15 February Mr G carried out two balance  transfers  to his NatWest  credit 
card account. 
On 18 February 2013 Bank 1 asked NatWest  to return the funds paid by cheque. Bank  1 has 
subsequently said this was due to an error  it made. Without that cheque payment, the 
balance and money transfers took Mr Gs credit card account several thousand pounds  over 
his credit limit. 
Also on 18 February NatWest put a block on Mr Gs credit  card  this meant  it couldnt  be 
used. 
NatWests records indicate it wrote to Mr G on 25 February. On 5 March Mr Gs wife, who 
was an additional  cardholder on the NatWest  credit card account,  called NatWest and made  
a small payment of under £100. She said her husband was overseas. NatWest gave her its 
international number and asked her to tell Mr G to call it. 
NatWests records show further letters were sent on 7 and 27 March 2013  and that on 
5 April Mr G called NatWest. The alleged Bank 1 error was noted, and proof of it requested.
On 10 April Mr G made  a sizeable credit  card payment  that brought his balance back under 
his credit limit. That same  day Mr G was asked to chase Bank 1 for proof of the error. And 
on 25 April there  was a further  discussion between Mr G and NatWest.  NatWest told him it 
was still awaiting proof from Bank  1. NatWests notes show that the block on the account 
was removed that day in response to Mr G indicating  he would make a complaint. 
On 12 March 2013 NatWest had filed an entry with CIFAS indicating that Mr G had misused  
his credit facility with it. The reason given was multiple encashment fraud.  
Throughout 2013 the minimum payment due on the credit card account was made by direct  
debit, gradually  reducing the balance. A sizeable payment of several thousand pounds was 
made in late January 2014, followed by money and balance transfers in February 2014. This 
took the account nearly up to its credit  limit again.  Over 2014 the minimum payment 
continued to be made  by direct debit. In early  February 2015  Mr G cleared the balance on 
the credit  card account. In March 2015  he made  balance transfers taking his account  nearly  
up to the credit limit. He continued to make  the minimum payment by direct debit. 
Ref: DRN16483982In November 2015, after several phone  calls with Mr G, the CIFAS fraud entry  was removed 
by NatWest.
In late 2015 Mr G complained to NatWest about  the difficulties with the February 2013 
payment and the CIFAS  marker on his credit file. On 11 January 2016 NatWest said it had 
correctly notified  the marker.  It said it returned  the cheque at Bank 1s request. It had 
advised that Bank 1 would have to provide  proof that it was Bank 1s error. The balance and 
money transfers that took Mr G over his credit limit were completed after the payment by 
cheque but before it was returned to Bank  1. The funds wouldve been pending which  meant 
he was able to use the credit  for the transfers.  NatWest said it could see hed spent  time on 
the phone  in relation to this matter.  It said it would credit Mr Gs account with £72 for calls 
and £80 compensation.
Mr G wasnt happy with this so he brought his complaint to us. He said NatWest shouldve 
removed the CIFAS  entry in 2013 when he provided  it with a copy of a 22 April 2013  letter  
from Bank 1 indicating the cheque had been blocked through Bank 1s error. 
It wasnt until October 2018 that our investigator  issued the view that is the subject of the 
request for a decision  from an ombudsman. The resolution of the complaint  by our service  
had been put on hold at various times in the previous years as Mr G hasnt been in a 
position to provide information regarding the complaint.
Our investigator noted that Mr G was unhappy with the effect that an incorrect  CIFAS marker 
added by NatWest  had had on him. She thought the CIFAS marker probably wasnt  an 
incorrect thing to do at the time. This was because the returned  cheque made it look like the 
balance transfers  were done against an incorrect cheque. There  was a period of time for him 
to replace the payment  made by cheque  before  the CIFAS marker was recorded.  He didnt 
reduce the balance beneath the limit until 10 April 2013, although some payments were  
made before then.  But she did think that the CIFAS  marker shouldve been removed sooner. 
After the restriction on the account was removed Mr G was able to use the account as 
normal so this showed NatWest didnt have  any concerns about  the account  or the way it 
was being used after April 2013.  
She thought  it was likely  that the CIFAS marker  had played a role in the closure  of some of 
his accounts with other providers but she didnt have  evidence this was the sole reason. 
Without clear evidence she couldnt  hold NatWest responsible for the commercial decisions 
of other  providers. 
In conclusion, she thought that the service  couldve  been better and NatWest should pay Mr 
G £300 in addition to the £152 already paid.
Mr G didnt agree with our investigators  view. He said he didnt know that the cheque  
payment hadnt  gone through. He said NatWest wouldve  known the cheque hadnt  reduced 
his NatWest balance  when he made  the credit and money transfers. It was NatWests 
responsibility to ensure  that he didnt exceed his credit limit. He referred to comments in 
2016 from one of our previous case handlers  that the CIFAS listing had contributed  to the 
closure of his accounts with other  providers.  Hed had to chase CIFAS  for two years to clear 
his name.  NatWest hadnt taken any steps to remove the marker  after hed paid the money.  
It was responsible for the closure  of his accounts  with Bank 1 and another bank that I will call 
Bank 2. NatWest had destroyed his credit history. He thought £300 compensation was an 
insult, and he wanted much higher compensation.
Ref: DRN16483983Our investigator thought Mr G had been informed  that the cheque  payment hadnt gone 
through before the CIFAS marker  had been applied.  And she said that if Mr G had provided 
the proof of Bank 1s error that NatWest  had asked for, the CIFAS marker wouldve been  
removed sooner  NatWest had no record that Mr G had provided the letter  from Bank 1 to it 
in 2013. So in this context  she thought that total compensation of £380 plus £72 for call 
costs was fair. 
The complaint then came to me for final decision.  Mr G said hed sent the 22 April 2013 
letter from Bank 1 to NatWest in April 2013. He said the letter  proved that NatWest was 
solely responsible  for what happened to him.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I can see that Mr G feels very strongly 
that NatWests actions in relation to the CIFAS marker has badly affected  his credit history  
and led to the closure of various  accounts.  I dont doubt his strength of feeling.  But Im afraid 
Im going  to have  to disappoint him, as I wont be asking NatWest to do anything  further.  
the initial notification  of the CIFAS marker
I think it was fair of NatWest to record the CIFAS marker in March  2013.  At the time Mr G 
made the money and balance transfers in early to mid-February 2013 the cheque had been  
deposited, so it appeared  Mr G had the credit  limit available. When  Bank 1 asked for the 
cheque to be returned it was reasonable for NatWest to consider whether there had been 
fraud in relation to the cheque and the transfers. 
It didnt place the CIFAS  marker until 12 March 2013; nearly  a month  after the cheque was 
returned. I understand Mr G says he was unaware  the cheque had been  returned. But I think 
NatWest did take steps to bring  it to his attention,  as the background to this decision sets 
out. Mr G may not have  been aware of this, because he was overseas, but I cant hold 
NatWest responsible for that. So I think Mr G was given the opportunity  to reduce  his 
balance back to below the credit limit before the CIFAS marker was placed, so I cant agree 
that it was unfair of NatWest to notify  the CIFAS marker. 
the CIFAS marker continuing until late 2015
Im satisfied that in April 2013 Mr G made NatWest aware that Bank 1 had said it had 
incorrectly requested  the return  of the cheque. NatWest reasonably asked for proof of this. 
Mr G has told us that he sent a copy of the 22 April 2013 from Bank 1 to NatWest.  But 
NatWests file shows no record  that this was received. 
What is clear from NatWests file is that by May 2013 Mr G was using the account as normal. 
The block  on the account had been  lifted,  and Mr G carried out several balance transfers 
over the next couple of years. If NatWest was still concerned that Mr G had committed fraud, 
this wouldnt have been possible. 
The CIFAS marker wasnt removed until late 2015  at NatWests request. Mr G says this was 
after two years of effort  with CIFAS on his part. But unfortunately  there  is nothing  to show  he 
contacted NatWest about the issue after late April 2013 until around  November 2015. 
Theres also nothing to show  that he followed up with NatWest to confirm  the 22 April 2013 
Ref: DRN16483984letter had been received.  If he had done  so, the fact that the CIFAS  marker was still in place 
would have come  to NatWests attention. 
But even without receipt of the 22 April 2013 letter, the fact that NatWest  was happy to allow  
Mr G to carry out balance  transfers throughout 2014 and 2015, means that it shouldve 
considered much sooner whether to remove the marker. 
the impact of the CIFAS  marker remaining in place until late 2015
Mr G believes  that the CIFAS  marker  being in place has impacted negatively on several  of 
his accounts with other providers. He says its the reason his accounts with Bank 1 and 
Bank 2 were  closed.  
I can only make findings about NatWest  in this decision. Im aware Mr G has made a number 
of complaints to these  other banks about  the closure of his accounts that have been 
considered by our service. 
Ive looked at our file in relation to his accounts with Bank 1. I was already familiar with it as I 
issued the final decision on Mr Gs complaints about  the closure of his joint and sole 
accounts with Bank  1. In that decision I didnt  agree  that the CIFAS marker  was the reason 
that Bank  1 had closed the accounts.  
Ive also looked  at our file in relation to his account  with Bank 2. I can see that in November 
2015 our adjudicator provided Mr G and Bank 2 with a view on his complaint to Bank 2. But 
there is no record showing that Mr G or Bank 2 accepted our adjudicators view, or asked for 
a decision from an ombudsman. So Im not able to reach any conclusion as to why Mr Gs 
account with Bank  2 was closed. And Im not able to reconsider  his complaint against Bank 2 
as part of this decision as it isnt a party to this complaint. Im sorry to disappoint Mr G. 
compensation
As Ive said earlier, in my opinion NatWest shouldve considered removing the CIFAS 
marker sooner.  But I cant hold it solely responsible  for the amount of time the marker was in 
place. Im afraid I cant be satisfied that Mr G did provide the letter of proof to NatWest.
But I do think the further compensation of £300  for the trouble and upset  hes suffered 
because of the poor service hes received from NatWest  at times is reasonable. This is in 
addition to the £80 compensation plus £72 call costs already paid. I appreciate Mr G wants a 
great deal more compensation. But my role isnt to punish NatWest. The total compensation 
of £452 is more than a token amount. I think it is fair, although I understand Mr G will 
disagree. Im sorry to disappoint him. 
my final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must  pay Mr G £300 compensation 
for trouble and upset hes suffered because of the banks poor service at times.  To be clear  
this is in addition  to the £152 compensation already paid to him. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 August 2019.
