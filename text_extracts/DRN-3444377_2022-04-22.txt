The complaint
Mr H complained because PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA required him to provide 
photographic identification and proof of address. Mr H didnt want to do this, and asked 
PayPal to close his account and delete his personal data. PayPal refused to do so.
What happened
In June 2015, PayPal emailed Mr H, saying that as a regulated financial institution it had to 
verify certain information about customers. It said Mr H needed to verify his identity by 
providing evidence of identity. The list consisted of an ID card, photographic driving licence, 
passport, or other photographic identity document from a government department.  Mr H 
didnt reply, and PayPal chased.
Theres a conflict of evidence about what happened next. Mr H said he rang and was 
promised a call back by a manager which didnt happen. PayPal said that two different 
managers had phoned Mr H and had told him that PayPal had to carry out these checks.
But both sides agree that Mr H, who didnt use his account very much, then asked PayPal to 
close his account and delete his personal data.
In early 2021, Mr H got in touch with this service. He said PayPal had started emailing him 
again for the photographic identification, and proof of address. Hed phoned, and again 
asked to close the account, which had been refused. Hed also tried to log onto his account, 
but couldnt do so without providing his phone number, which he also didnt want to do. He 
told us he wanted PayPal to close his account and delete his data.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Hs complaint. She said that the terms and conditions of Mr 
Hs PayPal account were set out in its User Agreement. This said:
Information about you 
We may request information from you as we reasonably require to facilitate our actions 
described in this user agreement, enable us to reduce the risk of fraud or
comply with our regulatory (including anti-money laundering) obligations. You must comply 
with these requests in a timely fashion. This may involve you faxing, emailing or otherwise 
providing to us at your own expense identification documents and information about your 
finance and operations (such as your most recent financial statements and merchant 
processing statements).
The investigator also explained that PayPal has a regulatory obligation to carry out this type 
of check. And PayPal also had a ten year retention period for all account data. She said that 
she thought PayPal had acted within the terms and conditions of the account.
Mr H didnt agree. He said that although PayPal might possibly have acted within the terms 
and conditions, it had told him that the only reason it couldnt carry out his closure request 
was because its own systems wouldnt allow it. Mr H didnt think this was a good enough 
reason for him to provide PayPal with the sensitive data it was requesting. He asked for an 
ombudsman decision.
My provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint. Before doing so, I considered all the 
available evidence and arguments to decide what would be fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
First, I said that there appears to be no suggestion that there is anything other than a zero 
balance on Mr Hs PayPal account. So this decision relates solely to whether or not Mr H is 
contractually obliged to provide additional personal information purely in order to have the 
account closed in line with his wishes.
Customers are entitled to ask for their bank accounts to be closed, and I considered that Mr 
H was also entitled to ask for his PayPal account to be closed. I put this argument to PayPal, 
and asked why it wasnt prepared to follow Mr Hs instruction to close his account. It was 
clear that Mr H didnt intend to use a PayPal account again, and didnt want to keep an 
account with PayPal - and PayPal didnt appear to want to continue to extend services to 
him.  As a result, the situation was in limbo, and this could be resolved for both sides by 
PayPal closing the account.  
PayPals response was that although Mr H was entitled to ask for his account to be closed, 
PayPal was also entitled to refuse to do so. It argued that it was requesting the information in 
line with customer identification and due diligence, and if it ignored these, it would be liable 
for fines and regulatory action. It also said if it were to comply with every account holder 
request to close their accounts without PayPal carrying out our due diligence obligations, it 
would be inundated with requests and would jeopardise its business licence.
PayPal also argued that its actions were set out in its User Agreement, which said that users 
should not use their accounts  to present to PayPal a risk of non-compliance with PayPals 
anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and similar regulatory obligations...where 
you expose PayPal to the risk of any regulatory fines by European, US or other authorities 
for processing your transactions. 
So here PayPal was sticking to its terms and conditions  but it was doing so in a way that 
seems inflexible in the individual circumstances here. And sometimes strictly following terms 
can lead to an unfair outcome in certain circumstances. I thought thats what had happened 
here.
I said this because PayPal opened the account for Mr H, and at that time it must have been 
satisfied that Mr H was a genuine customer and had passed all its security requirements. Mr 
H told us that he used the account just a few times. And PayPal has never suggested to us, 
even on a confidential basis, that it had any specific concerns about the matters Ive quoted 
above in the terms here, either before opening the account, or during any of the few 
transactions which Mr H had carried out in previous years. 
Given that PayPal was satisfied with the checks it had completed, both for the opening of the 
account, and for the transactions, I couldnt see any reason why more intense checks should 
be necessary purely to perform what is, by this stage, a purely administrative step in closing 
the account. Nor had PayPal given any specific details of the exact regulations which it claimed it would 
be breaching by closing Mr Hs account without having photographic identification and his 
personal phone number.
PayPals user agreement includes the following:  
We may request information from you as we reasonably require to facilitate our actions 
described in this user agreement, enable us to reduce the risk of fraud or comply with our 
regulatory (including anti-money laundering) obligations. You must comply with these 
requests in a timely fashion. This may involve you faxing, emailing or otherwise providing to 
us at your own expense identification documents and information about your finance and 
operations (such as your most recent financial statements and merchant processing 
statements).
But the key word here is reasonably. This service takes its decisions on the basis of what 
would be fair and reasonable. I wasnt persuaded that it would be either fair or reasonable 
for PayPal to refuse to close Mr Hs account, leaving it open indefinitely when neither side 
ever intends the account to be used in future. And I couldnt see that requiring extra personal 
data, purely to close an account, was fair and reasonable either in the circumstances here, 
especially when it had no problems with opening the account or the historic  transactions. 
So I considered that PayPal hadnt provided sufficient grounds for me to conclude that it 
would be fair and reasonable for it to require additional information in order to close Mr Hs 
account.
I also noted that PayPal had said it retains all personal data for ten years. I understand that 
this is PayPals policy and that it was acting in line with this here.  But when considered in 
the context of the circumstances of this complaint - PayPal would have already retained Mr 
Hs personal data for nearly seven years since the request for his personal information in 
June 2015. PayPal hadnt, to date, given any clear indication of why it needed to hold on to 
Mr Hs personal data for this long in the circumstances here beyond a strict adherence to its 
policy here.
But given the circumstances here and the time thats already passed, as well as ordering 
PayPal to close Mr Hs account, I thought it would also be fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances PayPal to delete any data it holds for Mr H in relation to this account, and 
confirm to him in writing that it has done so.
Responses to my provisional decision
PayPal didnt accept the provisional decision. It said that it had taken the correct actions. It 
said Mr Hs account status was limited, and in order to lift that limitation, it would need to 
verify the customers identity by documents from Mr H  who hadnt provided them. So 
PayPal said it wouldnt close the account. It also said that the account was still within the 
data retention period so it couldnt erase Mr Hs data.
Mr H said he had nothing to add, but was grateful that someone had finally seen sense, and 
was very glad he didnt have to go through this any more.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.Ive considered PayPals response to my provisional decision. I understand PayPals points. 
But I remain satisfied that while these may be PayPals processes, they havent led to a fair 
outcome for Mr H in his individual circumstances.
So I still consider my provisional decision was fair and reasonable, and I uphold Mr Hs 
complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I order PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie SCA to:
- close Mr Hs account without requiring further personal data from him;
- delete his personal data;
- confirm to him in writing that it has done both these things. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 May 2022.
