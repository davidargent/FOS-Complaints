The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited (VWFS) terminated the 
hire purchase agreement he had with them. 
What happened
On 1 March 2019, Mr S was supplied with a used car through a hire purchase agreement 
with VWFS. The agreement was for £23,995 over 49 months; with 48 monthly payments of 
£393.68, and a final optional payment of £10,125 if Mr S wanted to purchase the car at the 
end of the agreement.
In March 2020, as a result of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, Mr S was furloughed 
from work. He says that he tried to contact VWFS about his financial situation, but he was 
unable to get through to them. 
On 3 June 2020, VWFS sent Mr S a default notice, saying he needed to pay the £1,181.04 
arrears and late payment charges by 22 June 2020, or his agreement would be terminated. 
Mr S didnt make the payment, and VWFS terminated the agreement on 21 July 2020.
Mr S complained to VWFS that hed been unable to make the payments because hed been 
furloughed from work, and he didnt think it was fair that VWFS had terminated the 
agreement. VWFS didnt think theyd done anything wrong, saying the agreement had been 
terminated due to long standing arrears. Mr S wasnt happy with this, and he brought his 
complaint to us for investigation.
Our investigator said that, while Mr S had been, affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, hed 
also been in arrears before he was furloughed from work. She said that VWFS had followed 
the rules set out by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) that financial businesses must 
treat customers in arrears with forbearance and due consideration. But she hadnt seen any 
evidence that Mr S told VWFS hed been furloughed until after theyd terminated the 
agreement.
The investigator also said that VWFS had tried to assist Mr S by putting payment 
arrangements into place. But, because Mr S wasnt making payments, she thought theyd 
acted reasonably by following their process and terminating the agreement. And she didnt 
think VWFS needed to do anything more.
Mr S didnt agree with the investigator, and he provided bank statements to show the 
payments hed made to VWFS before he was furloughed from work. These showed that the 
payments for August and November 2019 hadnt been made (the direct debits werent 
collected because there were insufficient funds in Mr Ss account). Because of this, the 
investigator explained this didnt change her view.
If reply, Mr S said that VWFS were trying to use his arrears against him, and the whole thing 
about covid 19 pandemic is being totally over looked like it never happened. He also said 
that I know for a fact that at the start of this pandemic and Furlough I have no arrears on my 
account. And hes asked for an Ombudsman to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I have reached the same overall conclusions as the investigator, and for 
broadly the same reasons. If I havent commented on any specific point, its because I dont 
believe its affected what I think is the right outcome.
In considering this complaint Ive had regard to the relevant law and regulations; any 
regulators rules, guidance and standards, codes of practice, and what I consider was good 
industry practice at the time. Mr S was supplied with a car under a hire purchase agreement. 
This is a regulated consumer credit agreement which means were able to look into 
complaints about it. 
The FCA issued temporary guidance, that came into effect on 27 April 2020, about 
customers who were faced with payment difficulties as a result of Covid-19. This guidance 
says a firm providing motor finance agreements is able to consider granting a payment 
deferral. But it also says that, where the customer is already in arrears, businesses were 
expected to follow to follow the rules set out at CONC 7.3.4, which says a firm must treat 
customers in default or in arrears difficulties with forbearance and due consideration.
Ive looked at the payments Mr S paid to VWFS, which are set out in the table below:
Date Payment Due: Payment 
Amount:Date Payment 
Made:Payment 
Amount:Arrears:
31 March 2019 £393.68 31 March 2019 £393.68 £0.00
30 April 2019 £393.68 30 April 2019 £393.68 £0.00
31 May 2019 £393.68 31 May 2019 £393.68 £0.00
30 June 2019 £393.68 30 June 2019 £393.68 £0.00
31 July 2019 £393.68 31 July 2019 £393.68 £0.00
31 August 2019 £393.68 N/A £0.00 £393.68
30 September 2019 £393.68 30 September 2019 £393.66 £393.68
N/A N/A 1 October 2019 £131.22 £262.46
31 October 2019 £393.68 31 October 2019 £524.91 £131.23
30 November 2019 £393.68 30 November 2019 £131.23 £393.68
31 December 2019 £393.68 31 December 2019 £393.68 £393.68
31 January 2020 £393.68 31 January 2020 £393.68 £393.68
29 February 2020 £393.68 29 February 2020 £393.68 £393.68
31 March 2020 £393.68 8 April 2020 £393.68 £393.68
The bank statements Mr S has provided dont show that the above is incorrect. As such, Im 
satisfied that Mr S was in arrears when he was furloughed. Im also satisfied the payment 
arrangement Mr S agreed, to pay additional payments of £200 on 29 February 2020 and 
£193.68 on 31 March 2020, to clear the outstanding arrears, wasnt complied with. And at 
least one of these additional payments was due before Mr S was furloughed.
Because of the above, VWFS continued to treat Mr S with forbearance and consideration in 
line with CONC 7.3.4, which I think was reasonable.
Mr S didnt make the payments due for April, May, June and July 2020. And Ive seen that 
VWFS wrote to him to five separate occasions to advise him of his increasing arrears. And, on 3 June 2020, they issued him with a default notice, asking him to clear his arrears, and 
advising what would happen if he didnt.
Mr S hasnt said that he didnt receive any of the arrears letters, or the default notice, issued 
by VWFS. So, Im satisfied that he was reasonably aware of the situation, and the action 
VWFS were looking to take. And he couldve contacted their collections department after 
receiving any of these letters, to discuss the situation.
Mr S has provided an undated screenshot, which he says was from 16 April 2020, where he 
unsuccessfully attempted to contact VWFS. He says this was to let them know hes been 
furloughed. Unfortunately, this is the only evidence Ive seen that Mr S attempted to contact 
VWFS until the agreement had been terminated. 
So VWFS werent aware that Mr S was on furlough, and it was for this reason that he wasnt 
able to continue to make payments. And, as he didnt respond to the arrears letters or 
default notice, Im satisfied that VWFS acted reasonably in terminating Mr Ss agreement. 
And I wont be asking them to do anything more.
My final decision
For the reasons explained, I dont uphold Mr Ss complaint about Volkswagen Financial 
Services (UK) Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 December 2021.
