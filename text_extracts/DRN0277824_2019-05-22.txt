K821x#15complaint
Mr T has complained about short-term  loans granted  to him by CashEuroNet  UK LLC trading 
as QuickQuid. Mr T says he couldnt  afford these loans and that QuickQuid  didnt take 
appropriate steps to check whether he could afford them when he took them out. 
background
QuickQuid agreed 13 short-term loans for Mr T between July 2015  and January  2018. Each  
loan was repayable over between one and three months. Loans 10, 11, 12 and 13 were  
topped-up on a number  of occasions.  This is where  Mr T took out further borrowing under 
the same  agreement, before paying back the initial amount borrowed. Ive set out a 
summary of the lending  below.

One of our adjudicators has looked into Mr Ts complaint already and recommended  the 
complaint be upheld in part. She felt the checks QuickQuid carried out on loans 1 to 3 were 
proportionate, but that the checks carried out from loan 4 onwards werent. 
She thought  that had QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks  on loans 4 to 13 (including  
the top-ups on those  loans), it wouldve likely concluded that loan 5, and all of the loans that 
followed (including top-ups) wouldve been  unaffordable for Mr T, and would therefore not 
have agreed to them. 
QuickQuid disagreed with the findings. So as no agreements been reached at this stage, 
the case has come to me, as an ombudsman, for a final decision. Mr T raised  no new 
arguments in response  to the adjudicators assessment. So it would seem that loans 1  4 
Ref: DRN02778242are no longer in dispute. Therefore, my decision will focus on QuickQuids  decision to lend 
from loan 5 onwards.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
QuickQuid initially said it carried out assessments  of affordability and creditworthiness  at the 
time Mr T applied, which were proportionate to the type and amount of the loans. It said it 
also used verified  information  obtained from Mr T, as well as considering his past repayment 
history, credit-scoring  information,  and various  other third party reports  before lending  to him. 
And that the loans were then approved as they satisfied QuickQuids lending criteria.  
Our adjudicator, having looked  at everything, found  that QuickQuid didnt carry out 
proportionate checks from loan 5 onwards, and thought QuickQuid  should  refund the interest 
and charges Mr T paid from loan 5 onwards as set out above.
In response to these  findings, QuickQuid argued that its checks  were  proportionate, as it 
said they validated  Mr Ts income and expenses.  And that its affordability review was 
consistent with the FCA Handbook, and was in place at the time it received authorisation by 
the FCA. It says this confirms its assessments were  conducted properly and individually  for 
each of Mr Ts loan applications.
The adjudicator considered QuickQuids  response, but replied saying: I note what  you've 
said about the loans Mr T borrowed from 2015 onwards, however our job is to look not only 
into the rules and regulations set by the regulator at the time of borrowing  but also the law, 
good industry practice and all the available evidence and arguments to help us decide 
whether we think what the business  has done  is right or not. In this case  I don't think  you 
were right to provide Mr T with loans 5 to 13.1 (which he borrowed from 2015  onwards).
I fully agree with this point. This service has responded to QuickQuid on the above generic 
argument directly and through earlier final decisions.  So Im not going  to expand on this point 
any further here, though I have considered it alongside everything else in making my 
decision. 
I would remind QuickQuid  at this point of the FCA guidance in how complaints are to be 
dealt with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In particular DISP 1.3.2A [G] 
which says that businesses procedures for complaint handling should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result of determinations by the Ombudsman are effectively 
applied in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination by the Ombudsman  to the individuals in the respondent who 
handled the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman concerning  complaints 
received by the respondent and using this in training  and development of the individuals  
dealing with complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals dealing with complaints  in 
the respondent.
Ref: DRN02778243So my decision will focus on the specifics of Mr Ts complaint and what  both parties have  
said about this.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr T 
could repay  his loans in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and Mr Ts income and expenditure. With this in mind, in 
the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks might be reasonable 
and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that a lender should fairly and reasonably have  
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These would 
include where:
a consumers income is low or the amount to be repaid takes up a substantial portion 
of their income 
the amount,  or amounts, due to be repaid are higher 
there is a larger number and/or frequency of loans 
the period  of time during which a customer has been provided with borrowing is long.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Bearing all of this in mind, I think that there  are three  key questions  for me to consider in 
order to fairly and reasonably determine Mr Ts complaint.  These questions are:
1.Did QuickQuid, each time it lent, complete reasonable and proportionate checks to 
satisfy itself that Mr T would be able to repay  in a sustainable way? If not, would 
those checks have  shown that Mr T would  have been able to do so?
2.Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall 
pattern of lending  increase Mr Ts indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or 
otherwise harmful?
3.Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably  in some other way?
1. Did QuickQuid, each  time it lent, complete  reasonable  and proportionate checks to satisfy  
itself that Mr T would be able to repay  in a sustainable way?  If not, would those  checks  have 
shown that Mr T would have been able to do so?
Ref: DRN02778244When Mr T took out loan 5, hed been borrowing from QuickQuid for around eight months. 
So by this point,  I think QuickQuid shouldve been concerned about whether Mr T could 
afford to meet his repayments on this loan sustainably. As a result, from this point on, 
QuickQuid shouldve built a full picture  of Mr Ts financial circumstances, verifying the 
information it was given, before agreeing to lend any further.
Had it done so, it wouldve  seen that when  Mr T took out loan 5, he was earning around 
£1,200 a month. Proportionate  checks wouldve also shown QuickQuid that Mr Ts regular 
monthly living costs were just over £700 a month, and his regular credit commitments  were 
just under £500 a month. This meant his total monthly  outgoings were  already equal to his 
monthly income, and he had no disposable income  available to commit to any further credit 
commitments at this time.
Loan 6 was taken out around two weeks after loan 5 was settled, and Mr Ts financial 
position remained relatively unchanged. Had QuickQuid carried  out proportionate checks, it 
wouldve seen that while Mr Ts monthly  income had increased a little, to around  £1,300, and 
his living  costs decreased to around  £630,  his monthly credit commitments had increased  
substantially to around £650.  And that when these credit commitments were deducted from 
Mr Ts monthly  income  of £1,300, along with the £630 in living  costs,  meant  he now only had 
in the region of £20 remaining. 
So had QuickQuid  carried out proportionate checks when Mr T applied for loans 5 and 6, it 
wouldve seen that he had insufficient  disposable income available to commit to any further  
lending commitments. And I dont think QuickQuid wouldve approved these  loan 
applications knowing this.
I havent recreated individual, proportionate affordability checks  for loans 7 to 13a, because 
I dont think that it is necessary to do so. Ill explain why.
2. Taking into account the short-term purpose of the loans provided, did the overall  pattern of 
lending increase Mr Ts indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable  or otherwise harmful?
Ive looked at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history  with Mr T, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which QuickQuid should reasonably  have seen that further  
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid shouldve realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ts case,  I think that this point was reached  by 
loan 7. I say this because:
From  loan 7, Mr T was provided with a new loan within two days  of settling a 
previous one. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr T  
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole that repaying  his previous loan had left 
in his finances. And that Mr Ts indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mr T wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed QuickQuid. Mr T had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to QuickQuid over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr T lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards because:
Ref: DRN02778245these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ts indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Ts 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im also upholding  Mr Ts complaint about  loans 7 to 13a because  the overall pattern of 
lending increased  his indebtedness  in a way that was unsustainable or otherwise harmful  
and he lost out as a result.
3. Did QuickQuid act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive carefully thought  about everything provided.  Having done  so, Ive not seen anything here 
that leads me to conclude QuickQuid acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr T in some 
other way.  
In summary,  I dont think QuickQuid shouldve  agreed to loans 5  13a for Mr T, and I think  
Mr Ts lost out as a result. 
what QuickQuid  needs to do to put things right
refund  the interest and charges Mr T paid on loans 5 to 13a (including all top-ups);
pay interest on these refunds at 8% simple  a year from the date they were paid to the 
date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 5 and 6 from Mr Ts credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loan 7 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 7 to 13a should be removed from 
Mr Ts credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr T a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above I uphold Mr Ts complaint in part. 
And I require  CashEuroNet UK LLC to put things  right as described  above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 June  2019.
