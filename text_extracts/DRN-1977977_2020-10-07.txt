The complaint
Mr Q has complained that TRANSUNION INTERNATIONAL UK LIMITED took too long to 
update his credit file. 
What happened
Mr Q paid off two credit cards. Later, he applied for credit but got declined. He then saw that 
his TransUnion file had not yet updated to show the cards as settled. He feels that was 
probably the reason for his application getting declined. He says the decline was very 
embarrassing. The lender who declined his application explained that theyd based their 
decision on a different credit reference agency, and not TransUnion.
Mr Q complained about TransUnion, though by that point his file had been updated to show 
that the cards were settled.
Our investigator looked into things independently and didnt uphold the complaint. He found 
that the delay between Mr Q paying off his cards and them showing as settled was primarily 
because of the time it took the lenders to tell TransUnion about the settlement. And 
according to the lender who rejected Mr Qs application, theyd used a separate credit 
reference agency  so his TransUnion file wouldnt have been relevant.
Mr Q didnt agree, so the complaints been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done that, Ive come to the same conclusions as our investigator, and for much the 
same reasons.
Its not clear that there was any significant delay on TransUnions part here. It looks like the 
reason why it took some time for Mr Qs credit cards to show as settled was primarily 
because the credit card companies didnt update TransUnion earlier. And TransUnion were 
generally reliant on the data the lenders gave them  here, they couldnt have reasonably 
known that Mr Qs cards were settled until they were told so.
Even if I had found that TransUnion were responsible for the delay, my main concern would 
be whether Mr Q had suffered any significant financial losses because of the error  such as 
a declined application.
Here, the only significant loss that Mr Q put forward  and his main point of contention  is 
that he had a particular credit application denied. But that lender explained that theyd used 
a different credit reference agency to assess Mr Qs application. They didnt use TransUnion. 
So Mr Qs TransUnion file wouldnt have affected that application in any case. And I cant 
see that hes suffered any other significant losses here. Further, the cards are now showing 
as settled on his TransUnion file.
It follows that I dont require TransUnion to do anything further in this particular case.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold Mr Qs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr Q to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 November 2020.
