The complaint
Mr K has complained that he couldnt access his account with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA between 2010 and September 2021.
What happened
Mr K complained to us in March 2021 because he couldnt access his PayPal account due to 
a security issue. He said hed tried to resolve this numerous times with PayPal 
unsuccessfully. 
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ks complaint. She eventually assessed it and sent a 
copy of her findings to PayPal and Mr K. She said that the evidence provided by PayPal 
suggested it was most likely Mr K hadnt actually liaised with them between 2010 and 
October 2020. But she did accept hed contacted them via a chat function on 31 October 
2020. And she went on to explain that the evidence PayPal had provided showed that Mr K 
was able to access his account from 11 January 2021 onwards. And that hed done so 
successfully on several occasions between then and 17 September 2021. She felt the lack 
of action from PayPal in the period between 31 October 2020 and 11 January 2021 when Mr 
K was able to access his account, had caused him unnecessary distress and inconvenience 
and warranted a compensation payment of £50. 
PayPal agreed to our investigators assessment and credited Mr Ks account with £50. 
Mr K isnt satisfied with the assessment. He maintains he was unable to access his PayPal 
account at any time between the end of 2010 and 17 September 2021. And he thinks it is 
only fair that PayPal acknowledge the true facts and provide an apology in writing. Mr K has 
asked for an ombudsmans decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Because of our rules on time limits I cant actually consider any problems Mr K had logging 
into his PayPal account in the six years prior to him being able to show he complained about 
it to PayPal. The evidence I have shows Mr K first did this on 14 January 2021. This is not to 
say he didnt tell PayPal before this he had a problem accessing his account, but this is the 
date he actually complained about it. This means I can only consider the problems he had 
logging in from 14 January 2015 onwards. However, I dont consider this to be material, as 
the key issue in this complaint seems to be the fact Mr K couldnt log into his account for 
many years and  in particular - between 31 October 2020 when he contacted PayPal via a 
chat function and mid-September 2021 when Mr K has said he was finally able to access his 
account. 
Its difficult to understand why Mr K would be adamant he couldnt access his account until 
17 September 2021 if he was actually able to do so before this, as I cant see any reason 
why hed want to lie about this or could be mistaken. But, PayPal have provided evidence 
which looks like it shows Mr K doing this and passing their two stage authentication process 
on 11 January 2021. They have also provided evidence which theyve said shows Mr K 
successfully logged in on other occasions between January and September 2021. But, Im 
not convinced by this, as it doesnt show the same entries as the ones I can see on            
11 January and 17 September showing he passed the authentication process. The system 
print just references a web login on these other dates. So, it is not possible for me to be sure 
Mr K was actually able to log in on these dates. 
The difficulty I have with this case is that  having spoken to Mr K  Im convinced by his 
testimony that he did try and access his account, but was unable to do so over a many years 
before he was finally able to on 17 September 2021. This is because, as Ive already 
explained, I cant really see hed have any reason to lie about this or that he could be 
mistaken. But the evidence from PayPal  which Im not totally convinced by, could suggest 
otherwise. 
But  overall  Im more persuaded by Mr Ks testimony than PayPals evidence. And I think 
PayPal needs to do more than pay Mr K £50 in compensation. By this, I dont mean I think 
they need to pay him more money, as I think the £50 theyve already paid is adequate 
compensation. I mean that I think they also need to write him a letter apologising for the fact 
he couldnt access his account for a number of years or get the help he needed to resolve 
this problem. I dont expect PayPal to be specific on the dates involved, as I think this would 
be unreasonable. So the letter can be generic, as Ive described. 
Putting things right
For the reasons set out above, Ive decided to make PayPal send Mr K a letter apologising 
for the fact he couldnt access his account for a long period of time or get the help he needed 
to sort this out. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ks complaint and require PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA to write him a letter as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 May 2022.
