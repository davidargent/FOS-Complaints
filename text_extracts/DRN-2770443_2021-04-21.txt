The complaint
Ms P complains that she got misleading information from Vanquis Bank Limited (Vanquis)
and her credit file was wrongly marked. 
What happened
Ms P had a credit card from Vanquis. She was struggling with payments. In October 2019,
her debt of £3,365 was transferred to a debt collection agency (DCA). She agreed to pay
£150 to the DCA. But she remained in arrears until May 2020.
Ms P complained. She said she couldnt understand why she was getting statements from
Vanquis when her debt was with the DCA. And because she was paying £150 per month to
the DCA, she didnt see how she owed £157.13 to Vanquis. She thought this was due to
charges and didnt have to be paid. She thought he was told to ignore the statement in
January 2020. She paid off the £157.13 in May 2020, but the next statement showed £43.54
was due  this must be a mistake. Overall, she said Vanquis communications were
confusing.
Vanquis said Ms P had missed payments between July 2019 and April 2020. So those were
shown on her credit file. Vanquis had a responsibility to report accurate information to credit
reference agencies. Because Ms P cleared the arrears with payments of £300 in April 2020
and May 2020, the arrears would no longer show on her credit file from May 2020.
Ms P brought her complaint to this service. Our investigator looked at what had happened.
She said that the payment of £1000 made by Ms P in December 2019 didnt clear the
arrears of £1157.13. So, the January 2020 statement showed a payment of £157.13 was
needed. Ms P paid £150, so some arrears were still outstanding. Vanquis had correctly
advised late payment markers to credit reference agencies until May 2020 when the arrears
were cleared. Vanquis told her that they couldnt explain why the June 2020 statement
showed that £43.64 was needed  this must have been an error - and agreed to pay
compensation of £75 for that. 
Ms P asked that her complaint be reviewed by an ombudsman.
I reached a provisional decision where I said:
Ms Ps problems arose when she was struggling in 2019  on several months, no payments
were made into her account. So, by October 2019, there were arrears built up of £760.11.
And then the account was passed to a DCA to manage. Its important to say that the
arrangement that Vanquis had with the DCA was that they were a collection agent  so Ms P
paid money to the DCA  and agreed a payment plan with them. But the debt remained with
Vanquis and statements were sent by them. Ive seen the letter to Ms P from the DCA dated
October 2019 and it does say they were a collection agent.
Ive looked at Ms Ps Vanquis statements and the letters that Vanquis sent to her.
To help to understand what happened, I set out below what I found:

August 2020 No arrears £150 paid in: 3/7/20
September 2020 No arrears £150 paid in: 5/8/20
By the December 2019 statement, arrears of £1056.18 had built up. And adding the
minimum amount due, £1157.13 had to be paid that month  and by 2 January 2020. Ms P
paid £1000 on 18 December 2019. So, this still left £157.13 to be paid  so she was still in
arrears by that amount. Ms P had agreed a payment plan of £150 per month with the DCA,
and this was followed each month from the February 2020 statement (which showed that
£150 was paid in on 2 January 2020). But  the key point is that Ms P didnt clear the arrears
until May 2020  when she paid in £300. So  she was always behind with her payments.
Ive seen the statements Ms P was sent. There were also several notices of sums in arrears.
Each one was clear and showed the arrears and amounts due to be paid. So, Ms P
shouldve been aware of her situation. The December 2019 statement said, This month you
must pay £1,157.13. The Notice of Sums in Arrears dated 8 December 2019 said theminimum payments that have been requested areNet Arrears Outstanding £1,056.13
Each statement from December 2019 to April 2020 stated the arrears as £157.13. There
were three more Notices of Sums in Arrears  and each said there were arrears of £157.13.
I can see that Ms Ps credit file shows late payments up to January 2020  and this is
correct. Vanquis have told us that Ms Ps credit file will show that payments from June 2020
were up to date. Ms P has shown us her credit file, and this looks to be the case.
So, while I can see that Ms P found what happened confusing, it looks to me that Vanquis
communications were clear  and she had the chance to clear the arrears from December
2019  but she didnt. Vanquis were correct in advising the credit reference agencies of late
payments. So, I wont be asking them to do anymore in that respect.
Vanquis have told us that the June 2020 statement showing that a minimum payment of
£43.64 was due appeared to be an error  as part of discussions with our investigator, they
previously agreed to pay compensation of £75 for this. So, this provisional decision confirms
that, subject to any comments that either Ms P or Vanquis may have.
Vanquis made no comments. Ms P said (in summary) that Vanquis statements werent 
clear. So, it wasnt surprising she got behind with payments. She thought her debt was with 
the debt collection agency, not Vanquis. If she had understood her situation, she wouldve 
made the payments.
So  I now need to make a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered what Ms P has said. To me, it was clear that it was the DCA that were acting 
as an agent to collect Ms Ps payments and pass them to Vanquis  thats why Vanquis sent 
statements showing the balance and amounts outstanding. And I think the Vanquis 
statements are clear. Also, taken as a whole, their communications over the period gave Ms 
P a lot of information as to where she stood  there were four Notices of Sums in Arrears 
between December 2019 and April 2020 which also showed minimum payments due (and 
when) and arrears outstanding.
So  having considered what Ms P has said, I wont be departing from what I said in my 
provisional decision for the reasons I gave in it.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint.
Vanquis Bank Limited should pay Ms P compensation of £75. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms P to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 May 2021.
