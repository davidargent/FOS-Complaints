The complaint
Mr G complains Chetwood Financial Limited trading as BetterBorrow irresponsibly provided 
him with an unaffordable loan.
What happened
BetterBorrow provided Mr G with a loan of £10,000 in June 2022. The loan had 84 monthly 
repayments of around £192 and a total repayable value of around £16,140. 
Mr G complained to BetterBorrow in March 2023. He said had BetterBorrow completed 
reasonable and proportionate checks it would have identified this loan wasnt sustainably 
affordable for him. BetterBorrow didnt uphold Mr Gs complaint, so he referred it to our 
service for review. 
Our investigator reviewed the complaint and upheld it. She said BetterBorrow hadnt 
completed proportionate checks when assessing this lending request; so, she reviewed the 
information she considered it would have taken into account and which would have been 
available to it at the time. On review of this information, our investigator concluded 
BetterBorrow ought reasonably to have identified this loan wasnt sustainably affordable for 
Mr G; and therefore, it hadnt made a fair lending decision when providing the loan. 
Mr G agreed with our investigators assessment; BetterBorrow didnt accept the findings. It 
maintained its arguments that it considered its checks to be reasonable and proportionate 
and that it went on to make a fair lending decision based on the information it obtained. 
I recently issued a provisional decision where I set out, with reasons, my initial thoughts on 
this case and what I was intending to decide.
The following is an extract from my provisional decision:
Weve set out our approach to complaints about irresponsible and unaffordable lending as 
well as the key rules, regulations and what we consider to be good industry practice on our 
website; and our investigator referenced these within her assessment so both Mr G and 
BetterBorrow are aware of our approach.
BetterBorrow needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it responsibly arranged this lending 
for Mr G. The relevant rules, regulations and guidance at the time BetterBorrow arranged the 
lending required it to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks. These checks needed 
to assess Mr Gs ability to afford the loan and repay it sustainably over its term, without 
causing him financial difficulties or harm.
There isnt a set list of checks BetterBorrow needed to carry out, but the checks needed to 
be proportionate, taking into account things like the type, amount, duration and total cost of 
the credit, as well as Mr Gs individual circumstances.
And it isnt sufficient for BetterBorrow to just complete proportionate checks  it must also 
consider the information it obtained from these checks when going on to arrange the lending. 
BetterBorrow says it obtained Mr Gs declarations and used data from credit reference 
agencies to verify his income. It says it used Office of National Statistics (ONS) data to 
calculate Mr Gs non-discretionary monthly expenditure; and completed a credit check to 
cross reference this information and to identify Mr Gs existing credit commitments and credit 
history. BetterBorrow says these checks were proportionate and that it made a fair lending 
decision when providing Mr G with this loan. 
Having carefully considered BetterBorrowers argument, Im currently persuaded its checks 
were reasonable and proportionate in this instance; and that it went on to make a fair lending 
decision when providing Mr G with this loan. 
I say this because Mr G declared his income as around £2,100 per month after deductions. 
BetterBorrow used credit reference agency data to reasonably verify this income to be 
accurate across the previous six-month period. 
Mr G declared that he was living at home with parents and paid around £270 per month 
towards costs. BetterBorrow used ONS data, an industry recognised way of calculating non-
discretionary expenditure, to allocate around £650 towards Mr Gs monthly essential living 
costs. 
BetterBorrow also identified from its credit check that Mr G had existing monthly credit 
commitments of around £310. This was all in relation to a fixed term loan with an outstanding 
balance of around £13,500. While the check identified Mr G also held a number of running 
credit accounts these were all reporting with zero balances at the time of the check. 
BetterBorrow therefore calculated that Mr Gs monthly expenditure totalled around £920; 
leaving him with a disposable income of around £870 to cover the repayments towards this 
loan of around £192 and other living costs.
The checks BetterBorrow completed allowed it to obtain a level of satisfaction that the 
declarations Mr G had provided were accurate. There was no contradictory information from 
the checks it completed and as such there was nothing within the credit check information it 
obtained that I consider ought reasonably to have caused it any concerns. The report didnt 
identify any adverse information such as bankruptcy, CCJs, defaults or arrears. And it 
suggested Mr G was managing his existing lines of credit well, with a relatively low debt to 
income ratio of around 40%, and a monthly credit commitment to income ratio of around 
25%. So, I dont consider BetterBorrows checks needed to go as far as Mr G or our 
investigator suggests, by obtaining his bank statements. 
I say this because I consider BetterBorrow was entitled to rely on the information it had 
obtained and assessed as part of its affordability checks, based on my findings above. I 
accept Mr G has told us and provided evidence that hed taken out two other loans for 
similar values around four weeks before this one, and he questions why BetterBorrow 
wouldnt obtain an updated credit file.
While I appreciate Mr Gs position on this point, BetterBorrow cant be held accountable for 
the time it takes other lenders and credit refence agencies to update their records. 
BetterBorrow, like all businesses, is reasonably entitled to rely on the information it obtains 
through its checks, as long as the information isnt contradicted. And on this occasion, as 
Ive found above, I dont believe there was anything within the information BetterBorrow 
obtained that was contradictory or ought reasonably to have caused it concern.
The fact that the two loans Mr G obtained in May 2022 werent reporting on the credit file 
check BetterBorrow completed in June 2022 could quite reasonably have made a difference to BetterBorrows lending decision. But as they werent I cant agree it would have been 
proportionate, in the individual circumstances, for BetterBorrow to have conducted more 
detailed checks, by requesting bank statements for instance, to verify his income and 
expenditure. And it therefore follows BetterBorrow wouldnt reasonably have been aware of 
the types of payments through Mr Gs account and what he was using these loans for.
So as Ive found above, I currently consider BetterBorrow completed reasonable and 
proportionate checks and made a fair lending decision when providing Mr G with this loan.
BetterBorrow responded accepting my provisional decision and providing no further 
comments for consideration. Mr G didnt agree and provided further points for my 
consideration which Ive summarised as:
He was addicted to gambling at the time of the loan advance and the entirety of the 
funds were used to gamble within days of them being received;
Hes missed the last two payments towards the loan;
The terms of the loan being provided together with the information BetterBorrow 
obtained about his circumstances ought to have led to it completing further checks  
and had it reviewed his bank statements it would have identified gambling; and
He quoted from our investigators assessment pointing to their outcome and rationale 
to support his arguments on why he considers BetterBorrows checks needed to go 
further than they did and why his complaint should be upheld.
Mr G also provided a copy of his credit report dated June 2023 which we already had on file, 
and asked why a review of his bank statements hadnt been referred to within my provisional 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive not seen anything which leads me to depart from the conclusions I 
reached within my recent provisional decision. I appreciate this will be disappointing to Mr G 
given his strength of feeling on the matter, but Id like to ensure him Ive very carefully 
considered the further points hes raised in response to my provisional decision.
The majority of Mr Gs points focus on what he considers BetterBorrow would have identified 
had it completed more detailed checks, which he considers it should have, and specifically 
reviewed his bank statements. I did review Mr Gs bank statements as part of my review of 
the full case file, but as I set out within my provisional decision, I found the checks 
BetterBorrow had completed were reasonable and proportionate in the individual details of 
this case. This means I dont consider BetterBorrow needed to complete any further checks 
than it did. Therefore, it didnt need to verify Mr Gs actual income or expenditure by 
obtaining evidence from him to do so which could have included  but the rules arent 
prescriptive in terms of what evidence to consider  reviewing his bank statements, for 
example. 
So, it therefore follows while I reviewed Mr Gs bank statements as part of my full review of 
the case file, my investigation doesnt consider them as Im satisfied BetterBorrows checks 
didnt need to be more thorough than they were. I dont consider BetterBorrow was  or 
ought reasonably to have been  aware of Mr Gs compulsion, or that this loan would likely 
be used for gambling, based on the evidence it did obtain, which as Ive found above I 
consider to have been proportionate in the individual circumstances. Mr G has provided a copy of his credit file, which we already had on his case file and which I 
can assure him I also reviewed before issuing my provisional decision. However, I set out 
within my provisional decision why I considered BetterBorrow was entitled to rely on the 
information within the credit check it obtained. While Mr Gs updated credit file from June 
2023 does reflect two other loans taken in May 2022, as I set out previously these didnt 
reflect on the credit check BetterBorrow completed at the time; and I dont consider this 
unreasonable. 
I say this because this loan with BetterBorrow was advanced within around four weeks of 
these other loans; so, its not unreasonable that these loans didnt appear on the check 
BetterBorrow completed, or that the loans were being reported to a different credit reference 
agency than BetterBorrow used. In either event I consider BetterBorrow was reasonably 
entitled to rely on the information it identified from the credit report it obtained.
I accept Mr Gs strength of feeling on his case, and how he says this loan and complaint has 
affected his health. Its clear Mr G is experiencing financial difficulties as hes confirmed that 
hes recently missed payments towards this loan. But as Ive set out above and within my 
recent provisional decision, Im satisfied BetterBorrows checks were reasonable and 
proportionate in this instance; and that it went on to make a fair lending decision when 
providing Mr G with this loan.
So, it therefore follows I dont require BetterBorrow to take any further action in resolution of 
Mr Gs complaint.
Given what Mr G has told us about his current health and financial situation I would remind 
BetterBorrow of its obligations to treat Mr G fairly and sympathetically in its contact with him, 
and when looking to arrange a suitable and affordable payment arrangement for the 
outstanding balance.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above Im not upholding Mr Gs complaint about Chetwood Financial 
Limited trading as BetterBorrow.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 December 2023.
