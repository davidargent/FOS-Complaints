The complaint
Mr H says NewDay Ltd, trading as Aqua, unfairly and prematurely closed his credit card 
account.
What happened
Mr Hs account fell into arrears and NewDay agreed in November 2022 to set up a three-
month payment holiday. This was confirmed to Mr H in writing as was the expiry date of the 
holiday, which was 19 March 2023  by which time, among other things, the arrears needed 
to be cleared in full. Mr H called NewDay in December 2022 to discuss the letter which had 
crossed with another one giving notice of a default to be applied to the account. 
NewDay confirmed the letters had crossed and that a payment holiday had, in fact, been set 
up. NewDay ultimately closed the account after 19 March, saying it hadnt received payment 
as required or had a subsequent response from Mr H to any of the calls made or letters it 
had sent about the arrears to indicate he wouldnt be able to repay.
Unhappy with NewDays response, Mr H complained. NewDay replied that it had given him 
sufficient opportunity to repay the arrears. In the absence of payment by the deadline set, it 
closed the account and sold it onto a third-party debt purchaser in line with the terms and 
conditions of the credit agreement. NewDay did, however, pay Mr H £50 to compensate him 
for customer service issues. Mr H complained to this service as he didnt think the response 
was adequate.
Our investigator considered the complaint but was unable to recommend that it should be 
upheld. They believed NewDay had acted fairly in closing the account as it had and in 
paying him compensation in relation to the service hed received.
Mr H didnt agree with the investigators findings. He said NewDays payment of 
compensation showed his overall complaint should be upheld. The case was passed to me 
to review afresh.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont uphold this complaint. Ill explain why.
Its not in dispute that the terms of the credit agreement required Mr H to make certain 
payments on a monthly basis. By the time NewDay wrote to him in November 2022, hed 
missed consecutive minimum payments and was in breach of those terms. As such, 
NewDay was entitled to take action to try to recover the arrears.
Nevertheless, I need to determine whether NewDay treated Mr H fairly. Taking into account 
that Mr H was informed of the arrears on the account in good time, and of the consequences 
of non-payment by the end of the payment holiday, overall I think it has. Despite being made 
aware of the arrears, theres no evidence to support that Mr H tried to contact NewDay to 
pay them or alternatively to discuss any difficulties he might have been experiencing in 
clearing them. Its possible that he tried to call it to do this but, without any evidence to 
indicate on balance thats what happened  such as call notes from that time  I cant say 
with any certainty that thats the case. 
NewDays provided its record of inbound calls on Mr Hs account and these show no trace of 
any calls from him just prior to its closure. NewDays been able to provide some call 
recordings from the time and Ive listened to these carefully. But they dont suggest to me 
NewDay shouldnt have closed the account when it did. If anything, I believe they suggested 
to NewDay that Mr H would be making payment as requested and on time.
Im aware that, as Mr H says, NewDay paid him £50 in compensation. Im satisfied that was 
regarding an allegation made by Mr H about a call (in December 2022). NewDay says the 
compensation was paid as it couldnt locate the call at that time and so couldnt accept or 
deny what hed said about being promised a call back. It subsequently found the call and, on 
reviewing it, didnt consider it had done anything wrong at that time. Ive also listened to the 
call and am satisfied it didnt promise Mr H any call backs before closing the account and 
that hed not requested that. That being the case, I dont believe NewDay should pay any 
additional compensation for this aspect.
Taking everything into account, I find that NewDay treated Mr H fairly, overall, in closing the 
account as it did and in how it responded to the service issues he raised.
My final decision
For the reasons given, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2024.
