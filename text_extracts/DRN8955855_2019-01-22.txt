K820x#14complaint
Mrs L complains  that PDL Finance Limited  (trading as Mr Lender) made short-term loans to 
her when it shouldnt  have.
background
In September  2010 and in September 2011, Mr Lender made two loans to Mrs L (loans 1 
and 2). She repaid them  but only after some  deferrals  of payment (roll-overs).
Between August 2012 and May 2014, Mr Lender made four more  loans  to Mrs L (loans 3 to 
6). She repaid  them  but again  only after some  roll-overs.
In March 2018, Mrs L complained to the lender  that it hadnt checked that she could afford 
repayment of the loans   which she said she couldnt.
More than six years had gone  by between the date of loan 2 and the date of Mr Ls 
complaint. So Mr Lender said we couldnt  investigate loans 1 and 2. When  she brought her 
complaint to us, Mrs L didnt complain about loans  1 and 2. So this final decision mentions 
them only by way of background  and to keep  the numbering straight.
In its final response letter,  Mr Lender  made an offer to refund the interest on loan 6, which  it 
said had been  £285.00. It also offered to remove adverse information from Mrs Ls credit  file.
our adjudicators opinion
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in part. She didnt think 
that Mr Lender shouldve given Mrs L some  of the rollovers. The adjudicator said that from 
July 2012, the Consumer  Finance Association  (CFA) had been recommending  a limit of 
three roll-overs. She said that Mr Lender had been wrong to provide the last seven deferrals 
on loan 3 (between December 2012 and June 2013) and the last deferral on loan 4 (in 
December 2013). She recommended  that Mr Lender should:
1.process the offer for loan 6 as outlined above;
2.refund all interest  and charges that Mrs L paid on her last seven deferrals on loan 3 
and her last deferral on loan 4;
3.pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement*;
4.if applicable remove any negative information about the deferrals from Mrs Ls credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender  to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
must give Mrs L a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN89558552my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mrs L 
and to Mr Lender on 12 December 2018.  I summarise my findings:
I didnt think the lender  treated Mrs L fairly by allowing the fourth  rollover  (in late 
December 2012) or the subsequent rollovers on loan 3. Therefore I found  it fair and 
reasonable to order Mr Lender  to refund interest and any charges on those rollovers.  
I intended to order  Mr Lender to add interest  at our usual rate.
I didnt think the lender  treated Mrs L fairly by allowing the fourth  rollover  (in early 
January 2014) on loan 4. Therefore I found it fair and reasonable to order Mr Lender to 
refund interest  and any charges on that rollover. I intended to order  Mr Lender  to add 
interest at our usual  rate.
I didnt think the lender  shouldve made  loan 6, I found it fair and reasonable to order 
Mr Lender to refund the interest   and to order Mr Lender to add interest at our usual rate.
Subject to any further information from Mrs L or from Mr Lender, my provisional decision was 
that I was minded to uphold this complaint in part. I intended to direct  PDL Finance Limited 
(trading as Mr Lender) to:
1.refund  Mrs L each amount of interest and any charges she paid on:
1.1the fourth and subsequent deferrals on loan 3; and
1.2the fourth deferral  on loan 4; and
1.3loan 6; and
2.pay simple  interest at a yearly  rate of 8% on each such amount from the date Mrs L 
paid it to the date Mr Lender  refunds  it. If Mr Lender considers  that its required by 
HM Revenue  & Customs to withhold income tax from that interest, it should tell Mrs L 
how much  its taken  off. It should  also give her a tax deduction certificate if she asks 
for one, so she can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate; and
3.remove adverse information from Mrs Ls credit  file in relation to loan 6.
Mrs L agrees with the provisional decision.
Mr Lender hasnt responded  to the provisional decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.   
Before agreeing to lend to Mrs L, Mr Lender had to check  each time that she could afford to 
repay the loan.  Affordability checks should  be proportionate. Whats proportionate  depends  
on things like  but not limited  to  the size of the loan repayments and the information  the 
lender had about Mrs L.
Ref: DRN89558553From its records, Mr Lenders loans to Mrs L were as follows:
loan No. loan date loan amount (£) date loan repaid
1 08.09.10 150.00 31.08.11
2 21.09.11 150.00 31.08.12
3 31.08.12 200.00 31.07.13
4 01.09.13 500.00 31.01.14
5 31.01.14 600.00 30.05.14
6 30.05.14 950.00 04.12.15
loans 1 and 2
Im not considering  a complaint about loans 1 and 2, for reasons Ive mentioned. However  I 
see Mrs L had rolled  over each of those loans on 11 occasions.  So each of those  loans was 
extended from under a month to nearly a year. And I think  thats relevant background to loan 
3 and later loans.
Loans 3 to 6
Before each of loans 3 to 6, Mr Lender recorded Mrs Ls monthly income as about 
£2,380.00.
Before each of those loans it also did a credit  check.  I dont think such checks  can provide 
enough evidence  of future affordability. But from the results Ive seen, I dont  think they gave 
Mr Lender any reason to do more  checks than I would otherwise expect.
Loan 3 was going to require a repayment the following month of £260.00. That wasnt  a 
significant proportion  of Mrs Ls declared  monthly income. 
But I keep in mind  that Mrs L had deferred repayment of loans 1 and 2 for nearly a year 
each. So  with a break of only 3 weeks in September 2011  Mrs L had been  having short-
tem loans  from Mr Lender for nearly 2 years by August 2012. 
Having finally repaid loan 2, she was asking to borrow  again  straightaway. After  nearly  two 
years of short-term borrowing, I think that proportionate  checks  for loan 3 wouldve  been  
enough checks to get a full picture of Mrs Ls financial circumstances. That mightve  included  
asking her for copies  of documents such as payslips, bills and bank statements.
Mr Lender hasnt shown  us that it asked Mrs L about her outgoings at all. Without  information  
about her expenditure, the lender couldnt  have done enough checks  on affordability of the 
repayments. So Im not satisfied that it did proportionate checks before loan 3.
But Mrs L hasnt - yet- provided  a breakdown of her expenses or a copy  of her bank 
statements for July 2012. And the statement for August 2012 shows a bank account in credit  
 albeit with the input  of her partners salary.  Im unable to say that loan 3 was actually 
unaffordable for Mrs L at the time.
Therefore I cant say that proportionate checks wouldve  shown that loan 3 was 
unaffordable. And I dont find that the absence of proportionate checks  caused  Mr Lender to 
make loan 3 when it shouldnt have.
Ref: DRN89558554But Mrs L rolled over loan 3 on 10 separate occasions before she repaid it. And in deciding  
whats fair, I take into account good  industry practice at the time. I consider that  as regards 
rollovers  such good practice was reflected in guidance from the CFA. That suggested a 
maximum of three rollovers.
So I dont  think the lender  treated Mrs L fairly by allowing  the fourth rollover  (in late 
December 2012) or the subsequent rollovers on loan 3. Therefore I find it fair and 
reasonable to order Mr Lender  to refund interest and any charges on those rollovers.  I will 
order Mr Lender to add interest  at our usual rate.
Mr L finally repaid loan 3 in late July 2013.  About a month later she asked for loan 4. Loan 4 
was going to require a repayment of about £650.00. So I think that  again - proportionate 
checks wouldve been enough checks to get a full picture of Mrs Ls financial circumstances.
Mr Lender hasnt shown  us that it asked Mrs L about her outgoings at all. So Im not satisfied 
that it did proportionate checks before loan 4.
But Mrs L hasnt - yet- provided  a breakdown of her expenses or a copy  of her bank 
statements for August  2013. And the statement for November 2013 shows  a bank account in 
credit  albeit with the input of her partners  salary. Im unable  to say that loan 4 was actually 
unaffordable for Mrs L at the time.
Therefore I cant say that proportionate checks wouldve  shown that loan 4 was 
unaffordable. And I dont find that the absence of proportionate checks  caused  Mr Lender to 
make loan 4 when it shouldnt have.
But Mrs L rolled over loan 4 on 4 separate occasions before  she repaid it. And I keep in mind 
good practice at the time - a maximum of three rollovers.
So I dont  think the lender  treated Mrs L fairly by allowing  the fourth rollover  (in early January 
2014). Therefore I find it fair and reasonable to order Mr Lender to refund interest and any 
charges on that rollover. I will order Mr Lender to add interest at our usual rate.
After the deferred  repayment of loan 4, loan 5 was going to follow  immediately. And loan 5 
was going to require a repayment of around £780.00. That was a significant proportion  of 
Mrs Ls declared income. 
So I think that  again - proportionate checks wouldve been enough checks to get a full 
picture of Mrs Ls financial circumstances.
Mr Lender hasnt shown  us that it asked Mrs L about her outgoings at all. So Im not satisfied 
that it did proportionate checks before loan 5.
But Mrs L hasnt - yet- provided  a breakdown of her expenses or a copy  of her bank 
statements for December  2013. And the statement for November 2013 shows  a bank 
account in credit  albeit  with the input  of her partners salary. Im unable to say that loan 5 
was actually unaffordable for Mrs L at the time.
Therefore I cant say that proportionate checks wouldve  shown that loan 5 was 
unaffordable. And I dont find that the absence of proportionate checks  caused  Mr Lender to 
make loan 5 when it shouldnt have.
Ref: DRN89558555Mrs L rolled over loan 5 on 3 separate occasions before she repaid  it.
After the deferred  repayment of loan 5, loan 6 was going to follow  immediately. Loan 6 was 
for £950.00. With the contractual interest of £285.00, it was going  to require a repayment of 
£1,235.00 in June 2014.
So  again - proportionate checks for loan 6 wouldve been enough checks  to get a full 
picture of Mrs Ls financial circumstances.
Mr Lender hasnt shown  us that it asked Mrs L about her outgoings at all. So Im not satisfied 
that it did proportionate checks before loan 6.
Mrs L has provided a copy of her bank  statement  for April 2014. That shows that  in 
addition to Mr Lender  Mrs L had at least  four other short-term loans in that month. It also 
shows that the bank had refused to honour  a payment of £600.00 to one of those  lenders.
 
If Mr Lender had done proportionate checks it wouldve seen what  Ive seen. Mrs L couldnt  
afford to repay its loan 6 in a sustainable  way  that is without further short-term borrowing. 
So it wouldnt have made loan 6 and Mrs L wouldnt have paid any interest  on it.
Shortly after taking loan 6, Mrs L contacted  Mr Lender to say that she was in financial 
difficulty. It agreed a repayment arrangement. So Mrs L repaid loan 6 by December 2015  
with only the original contractual interest  of £285.00.
In its final response letter  Mr Lender  offered to refund interest on loan 6 and to remove any 
adverse information  from Mrs Ls credit  file. As I dont think  it shouldve made loan 6, I find it 
fair and reasonable to order Mr Lender to refund the interest  and to order Mr Lender  to add 
interest at our usual  rate.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct PDL Finance Limited (trading as Mr Lender)  to:
1. refund Mrs L each  amount  of interest  and any charges she paid on:
1.1 the fourth  and subsequent deferrals on loan 3; and
1.2 the fourth  deferral on loan 4; and
1.3 loan 6; and
2. pay simple interest at the yearly  rate of 8% on each such  amount from the date Mrs L 
paid it to the date Mr Lender  refunds  it. If Mr Lender considers that its required by 
HM Revenue & Customs to withhold income tax from that interest, it should tell Mrs L 
how much its taken off. It should  also give her a tax deduction  certificate if she asks 
for one, so she can reclaim  the tax from HM Revenue & Customs if appropriate; and
Ref: DRN895585563. remove adverse  information from Mrs Ls credit file in relation to loan 6.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 February  2019.
