The complaint
Mr O complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA issued a refund for a phone he sold. 
He said he was away from home and never saw PayPals enquiries about the sale. And he 
never got the phone back. Mr O says a debt collection agency is chasing him for the money.
What happened
Mr O said that hed missed a number of emails, from the buyer of a phone he sold, and then
from PayPal, about the phone. He said that he was away, and couldnt get access to his
emails. Mr O said that by the time he was able to pick up the messages, his account had
been debited, and the money given back to the buyer. But he said he didnt even get back
the item he sold.
PayPal said that Mr O received a payment on 14 October 2019 for goods hed sold.
On 9 February 2020, the buyer filed a dispute to say that the item received was not as
described. On 10 February the buyer escalated the dispute to a claim. Mr O was given ten
days to respond. PayPal said it contacted him by email on 10 February, 13 February and 18
February, but he didnt respond. PayPal then closed the case in the buyers favour, because
Mr O hadnt responded.
PayPal said it had warned Mr O that he might not get the item back. And it also said that Mr
O wasnt eligible for seller protection because he hadnt responded to PayPals requests for
information on the dispute.
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. She said that her concern was that
PayPal accepted the dispute nearly three months after the buyer purchased the phone. If the
goods were faulty, she thought this wouldve been reported straight away. Our investigator
thought PayPal should have viewed this as a warranty issue (which isnt covered by
PayPals buyer protection). She thought it was unfair that Mr O had lost Â£800 and hadnt got
his phone back.
PayPal didnt agree. It said a buyer can open a dispute for 180 days from the date of the
transaction under its buyer protection policy. And if one party fails to respond, then the case
will be closed in the other partys favour. Mr O had ten days to reply, and he didnt reply. So
the case was closed in the buyers favour, and Mr O wasnt covered by seller protection.
Our investigator repeated her concern that the buyer raised a dispute over three months
after the goods were received. She said that to contact Mr O after three months and give him
a ten-day deadline was unfair. She said that surely the problem with the goods was visible
earlier than this?
PayPal repeated that Mr O had ten days to reply. Because no agreement was reached, this 
case was passed to me for a final decision.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I did not propose to 
uphold it. This is what I said then: 
The emails that Mr O has sent us suggest that the buyer didnt simply claim from 
PayPal for the item, but had tried to contact Mr O first. Those emails say that the 
buyer had been trying to get in touch with Mr O for some time. That suggests to me 
that PayPals contact with Mr O about this case didnt just come out of the blue, 
several months after the transaction.
Those emails also clarify what the buyer said was wrong with the phone  the buyer 
said that it had stopped working, and on checking hed found that the phone had 
been blacklisted as a stolen phone.
Our investigator thought that if something had gone wrong with the phone some 
months after the sale, then it was almost certainly a warranty issue. But the other 
thing that, as I understand it, could cause this problem is if the phone was either 
stolen, or had outstanding finance on it which the original owner had stopped paying. 
Either of those things could mean that the phone worked initially, and was later 
blacklisted. Thats what the buyer claimed had happened. That would mean that the 
phone was entirely useless, and would explain why the buyer said hed simply 
disposed of it.
I dont know whether this phone was blacklisted or not. And even if it was, theres no 
way for me to know whether Mr O could have been aware that this might happen, 
when the phone was sold.
But I do think it was very important for Mr O to set out his response to this complaint. 
The buyer appears to have made a very serious allegation about the phone that Mr O 
sold. Once an allegation like this is made, if PayPal doesnt hear anything in reply, 
then I would expect PayPal to uphold the buyers claim. And, although PayPal says it 
didnt ask the buyer to send the item back because Mr O didnt respond, I wouldnt 
say it was unfair if a phone which is allegedly stolen isnt returned to the seller either.
I know that Mr O has said he was simply out of contact at the time that these emails 
from PayPal were sent, but it appears, from the correspondence that Mr O has sent 
us, that the buyer had also been trying to get in touch with him before this. So I 
havent been able to see that Mr O didnt have any opportunity to respond to the 
buyer about any problems with the phone, either before the PayPal complaint or as 
part of it.
I know that PayPal said that all it has done in this case is to email Mr O, then act in 
line with its policy when he failed to respond. But, taking account of the evidence that 
PayPal had, which was simply the allegations made by the buyer, and no response 
from Mr O, as well as the documents that Mr O has shown us, which suggest the 
buyer had already tried to contact Mr O, I dont think that its most likely that the 
decision PayPal made in this case was unfair or unreasonable. I dont think that 
PayPal was wrong, on the information it had, to take a decision to refund the buyer, 
or not to require the buyer to return the item.
I know Mr O will be disappointed, but I dont think this complaint should be upheld.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both parties replied. 
What Ive decided  and whyIve considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal said it agreed with my provisional decision, and it had nothing to add.
Mr O sent us an invoice for a phone, and a letter responding to my provisional decision. He 
set out a timeline of what had gone wrong, and repeated that PayPal only gave him ten days 
to respond. 
Mr O said that he sold the goods through an auction site, and PayPal was only the payment 
method. Mr O said that the buyer didnt file a dispute with the auction site, which he thought 
should have been how this issue was resolved. 
Mr O also said PayPal sent him emails at a point when he was out of the city and without 
internet. By the time he saw the emails, PayPal had already paid back the buyer. Mr O said 
that PayPal should have called him or written him a letter, because it was an urgent matter. 
Mr O said that the buyer had been trying to contact him on 9 February, but then made a 
claim to PayPal after just one day. He repeated that he thought the buyer should have raised 
this through the auction site. And he said that the buyer made a very serious allegation 
about the phone. So hed sent us the invoice, to prove the phone wasnt stolen. Mr O said 
that PayPal had believed this allegation without any evidence. 
Mr O said it would be very unfair on him if I didnt uphold this complaint. He said PayPal 
should have referred this case back to the auction site, and it should have asked the buyer 
for evidence of his claim. And he said the buyer shouldnt have been able to dispose of the 
phone without telling him, or showing that it was stolen. 
Mr O said that because he wasnt able to contact PayPal within ten days, he lost his money, 
lost the phone, and had a serious allegation made against him. 
Mr O wanted me to carry out further investigation, so I could find out that this wasnt really a 
stolen phone. 
I understand that Mr O expected any dispute to be dealt with by the auction site he used to 
sell this item. But I dont agree that PayPal was only the payment method, so any claim by 
the buyer ought to have been referred back to the auction site by PayPal. PayPal provides 
its own buyer and seller protection, which is set out in Mr Os user agreement with PayPal. 
So I dont think that PayPal did anything wrong by accepting and dealing with the buyers 
claim in this case.
I understand that a serious allegation was made in this case. I should stress that I certainly 
havent accepted that this allegation was true. And I dont think that PayPal accepted this 
either. But because of the seriousness of this allegation, I think it was particularly important 
that Mr O responded to PayPal.
Mr O said that PayPal should have rung or written to him. But PayPals primary method of 
communication is by email. And Mr O has told us he was away from home, so it doesnt 
seem likely that a letter would have reached him either. I dont think that what has gone 
wrong here happened because PayPal didnt also write to Mr O.
We know that Mr O didnt respond to PayPals emails about this case, and that he hadnt 
responded to the buyers earlier enquiries (although Mr O tells us that this only gave him one 
extra day). But that does mean that, on one hand, PayPal had a serious allegation about a sale which is covered by its buyer protection. And on the other hand, it had received no 
response from Mr O that it could use to refute those allegations. 
I know that Mr O has now been able to send us an invoice for the phone, to show hed 
purchased it legitimately and that it wasnt stolen. But PayPal didnt have that evidence at 
the time. In that situation, I dont think that PayPal made a mistake in refunding the buyer. 
And its terms do set out that it wont always ask the buyer to send the item back. Ive 
explained that, given what PayPal had been told at the time, I dont think it was unfair for 
PayPal not to require the item to be returned.
I know that Mr O will be disappointed, but I still dont think that the steps that PayPal has 
taken in this case were unfair or unreasonable.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 October 2021.
