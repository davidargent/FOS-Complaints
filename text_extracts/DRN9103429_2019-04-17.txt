K820x#14complaint
Mr B is unhappy how long it takes  for funds to clear into his National Westminster  Bank  Plc 
(NatWest) account.
background
Mr B had an account with NatWest. But the bank closed his local branch. So he had to use 
his local post office to pay cheques into his NatWest Account. According to the cheque  
deposit envelopes provided  by NatWest his money shouldve  been credited to his account 
on the second business day after hed paid it in. But it was sometimes taking two days  
before it even reached the bank. So Mr B would like NatWest  to change the wording on its 
envelopes and compensate him for the inconvenience. 
NatWest said itd spoken to Mr B about the wording used on the envelope.  And itd provided 
feedback to the relevant  department. But the envelope  also said cheques would follow  the 
normal cheque processing cycle after they have  been received by the bank. And the terms 
and conditions of the account  say the process  begins when NatWest receives the cheque   
not when its handed in at the post office.
Mr B wasnt  satisfied with NatWests response. So he contacted our service  and our 
adjudicator looked into the matter. She listened  to Mr Bs telephone discussion with the 
bank. And she looked at the wording on the cheque deposit envelope. 
She felt it did confirm what was stated  in the terms and conditions, even if it was a slightly 
unclear. And that wasnt something  our service would normally  interfere with. So she felt the 
banks offer of £20.80 compensation for Mr Bs time and call costs was appropriate in the 
circumstances.
Mr B felt the wording wasnt  just slightly misleading.  And he felt he should  be compensated 
more. So hes asked  for an ombudsmans final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Bs local branch had closed so he had to pay cheques into his NatWest  account  through 
the post office. And hes concerned how long it was taking the money to clear  into his bank 
account. So Ive looked carefully at both the cheque deposit envelope and the terms and 
conditions of the account to see whats happened.
The envelope states the money will be added  to Mr Bs account  on the second business day 
after paying  the cheque in. So I do understand why Mr B wouldve assumed the cheque  
would clear into his account a little sooner. But the envelope also says cheques  will follow 
the normal cheque  processing cycles after they have been  received by the bank. And the 
accounts terms and conditions state  that cheques normally clear two business days  after 
they are received by NatWest. 
I can understand the confusion caused by the wording used. The deposit  envelope  does 
refer the customer to the banks normal processes. But it couldve been clearer  that the two-
day period only commences when the cheque arrives at the bank.
Ref: DRN91034292I can see NatWest has passed Mr Bs comments to the relevant department  to look into. But, 
as our adjudicator  has explained, its not the role of this service to tell NatWest  how to run its 
business. Our role is to see if NatWest has made a mistake. And I cant really  say it has. The 
bank has cleared Mr Bs cheques in line with its normal  processes  even if it hadnt stated 
what those processes were on the deposit  envelope.
I do understand Mr Bs frustration. When he had a local branch he wouldve been able to 
hand his cheques over the counter. But now he has to go to his post office  and wait for them  
to send the cheques to NatWest.
NatWest has made a business decision  where it wants  to operate  branches. And thats not 
something our service is able to look at. But I hope NatWest takes note of his comments  and 
reconsiders the wording  it uses on the deposit  envelopes.
Based on what Ive seen,  I think the £20.80 compensation NatWest  has offered Mr B for his 
time and call costs is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. And I wont  be asking 
NatWest to do anything  more.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 May 2019.
