K822xcomplaint
Ms F complains about NRAM  Limited  (NRAM)  and its failure  to properly report to credit  
reference agencies  Ms Fs agreement  to pay. This meant that it remained on her credit  file 
for longer than necessary.  
Ms F wants NRAM  to pay her compensation, including for her inability to change her 
mortgage while the incorrect reporting  affected  her credit rating.
background 
I set out the background  to this matter, and my provisional view, in a provisional decision 
dated December  2019. A copy of that decision is attached. 
In that view, I set out why I thought that NRAM Limited ought to increase its offer of 
compensation to Ms F. 
That view has been shared with the parties  and they have been invited to respond. 
NRAM Limited acknowledged receipt of the decision and has submitted no further 
comments. 
Ms F has acknowledged receipt of the decision  and, despite indicating  that she intended to 
respond, has not done so. 
The deadline  for response has now passed. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In the absence of any further evidence or arguments being put forward  by the parties,  my 
view remains  the same as set out in the provisional  decision. 
I therefore adopt my provisional decision and reasons as my final decision.

For the reasons  set out in my provisional  decision dated December 2019, I uphold Ms Fs
