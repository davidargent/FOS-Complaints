The complaint
Miss W complains that Intrum UK Limited gave the wrong outstanding balance in a Notice of 
Assignment (NOA) it sent. 
What happened
Miss W had an account with another business Ill call L that was sold to Intrum. On 4 
November 2022 Intrum sent Miss W a NOA that said it had purchased the debt from L with 
an outstanding balance of £1,142.40
Intrum says that on 7 November 2022 it noticed the outstanding balance figure in its NOA 
was wrong as it shouldve been £2,236.13. Intrum says it placed the account on hold while it 
looked into the mistake. 
On 14 November 2022 Miss W spoke with an agent at Intrum and asked about the 
outstanding balance. The agent advised Intrum was unable to confirm the correct 
outstanding balance for the debt at that time and asked Miss W to call back and confirm 
around a week later. The accounts were placed on hold in the meantime and the agent 
agreed to take payment when Miss W called back. 
On 17 November 2022 Miss W paid £1,142.40, the amount quoted in Intrums NOA dated 4 
November 2022.
On 21 November 2022 Intrum issued a revised NOA that said Miss W owed £1,057.59 in 
relation to the debt it purchased from L. 
A short time later, Miss W complained to Intrum and said shed paid the outstanding balance 
quoted in its original NOA. Miss Ws told us she doesnt think its fair for Intrum to ask her to 
make payments above the amount quoted in its NOA. Intrum issued a final response and 
apologised that it had issue an NOA with the incorrect outstanding balance on 4 November 
2022. Intrum confirmed the correct outstanding balance it had purchased was £2,236.13 and 
that after Miss W made a payment of £1,142.40 the figure had reduced to £1,057.59. Intrum 
also said its agent had been unable to confirm the balance on 14 November 2022 when Miss 
W called and placed the accounts on hold to give the business time to confirm the correct 
information. 
An investigator at this service looked at Miss Ws complaint. They asked Intrum to pay Miss 
W £150 for the distress and inconvenience caused by the incorrect balance quoted in its 
NOA dated 4 November 2022. But the investigator didnt ask Intrum to write off the 
remaining balance. Intrum agreed but Miss W asked to appeal. As a result, Miss Ws 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Intrums explained that its NOA of 4 November 2022 was issued in error and that it 
contained the wrong outstanding balance figure. Ive listened to the call Miss W had with 
Intrum on 14 November 2022 and she asked the agent to confirm the outstanding balance. 
But the agent explained they werent able to do so and asked Miss W to call back around a 
week later so Intrum could confirm the correct balance. The agent advised the account 
would be placed on hold in the meantime and that Miss W could call back to make a 
payment on 22 November 2022.
Miss W went on to make a payment of £1,142.40 on 17 November 2022. But when Intrum 
completed the process of setting up Miss Ws account it found she owed a further amount of 
£1,057.59 to clear the balance in full. I can understand why Miss W feels its unfair to ask her 
to pay more than the figure quoted in Intrums NOA. But I wouldnt expect either side to be 
bound by a genuine mistake and Im satisfied thats what happened here. In addition, 
Intrums agent told Miss W the outstanding balance figure couldnt be confirmed when she 
called on 14 November 2022. Whilst I understand Miss W wanted to clear the balance, I 
havent been persuaded it was unreasonable for Intrum to request a week to confirm the 
correct outstanding figure. 
So whilst I agree Intrum made a mistake, Im not persuaded it would be fair to tell it to write 
off the remaining balance. In my view, Intrum took steps to confirm the balance and 
corrected its initial error. And Im satisfied Intrums request for Miss M to repay the remaining 
balance is fair and reasonable. 
Our investigator thought Intrum should acknowledge the distress and inconvenience caused 
to Miss W by way of a payment of £150. I agree that figure reasonably reflects the impact of 
the issues raised and is a fair way to resolve her complaint. As a result, Im going to uphold 
Miss Ws complaint and direct Intrum to pay her £150 for the distress and inconvenience 
caused. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss Ws complaint and direct Intrum UK Limited to pay her 
£150. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 May 2023.
