The complaint
Mr F, trading as W complains that he lost out financially due to delays by Bank of Ireland 
(UK) Plc (BOI).
What happened
Mr F asked BOI to transfer £265,025 from his GBP account to a euro account he held with 
another bank. The receiving bank confirmed it had notice of the transfer on 14 September 
2022 but the funds didnt arrive until 28 September 2022.
Mr F asked BOI to compensate him for the difference in exchange rate which would have 
been applied on 13 September 2022 to when the payment was received by his bank on 28 
September 2022.
BOI said there had been delays carrying out compliance checks due to an increase in the 
volume of payments under review following additional Russian sanctions. As it didnt think 
the handling time was excessive, BOI didnt agree to compensate Mr F.
Our investigator didnt initially recommend the complaint be upheld but after Mr F provided 
his response to the investigation outcome, our investigator changed his view. He thought 
BOI had delayed the international transfer by five days.
BOI agreed to pay Mr F £250 to apologise together with interest at 8% on the amount it 
transferred. BOI didnt however agree that it should consider the change in exchange rate as 
part of putting things right.
Our investigator thought that as BOI accepted there had been a delay, it was fair to take 
account of the change in rate. But he thought that as the receiving bank rounded up the 
exchange rate on 28 September 2022, it would have done the same had it received the 
money five days earlier. On this basis, our investigator didnt think that BOI should pay more. 
However, he did say that he would consider things further if Mr F could get confirmation from 
the receiving bank that it would not have rounded up the rate five days earlier.
Mr F didnt agree with the investigation outcome. He gave the investigator an email from the 
receiving bank which showed that it applied a two tic margin (0.0002) to the rate it used on 
28 September 2022. The wholesale rate was 0.8998, so the margin brought the rate up to 
0.9. The same email said that the wholesale rate on 23 September 2022 (at the same time 
of day) was 0.8809. Mr F said that if you apply the same margin  0.0002  to this wholesale 
rate, it would have brought the rate the receiving bank used to 0.8811. If hed benefited from 
the earlier rate, Mr F said he would have been better off.
Our investigator said that without confirmation from the receiving bank, we couldnt be sure 
that it would have applied the same margin had the transfer happened on 23 September 
2022. Our investigator thought it more likely that the receiving bank would have still rounded 
the rate up to 0.9. Mr F disagreed with this approach so the complaint came to me to decide.
I issued a provisional decision on 1 September 2022 which said:
I think its agreed that due to delays on the part of BOI, the transfer happened five 
days later than it should have. So, I dont intend saying more about this aspect of Mr 
Fs complaint. Instead, I want to concentrate on how BOI should put things right.
I agree with the investigator that despite what BOI has said, as it is responsible for a 
five day delay, part of the resolution of Mr Fs complaint should involve putting him 
back in the position he would have been had the transfer happened sooner. This 
means BOI should compensate Mr F for the loss he suffered when the receiving 
bank carried out the exchange on 28 September 2022 rather than 23 September 
2022.
Our investigator went back to the receiving bank to ask whether it would have 
rounded up the wholesale exchange rate to 0.9 on 23 September 2022. The 
receiving bank replied to say that it never rounds up the exchange rate it uses. On 
this basis, I dont have reason to conclude that the receiving bank would have used 
the same rate on 23 September 2022 as it did on 28 September 2022.
This leaves the question of what rate the receiving bank would have used had the 
transfer happened sooner. Mr F says that the receiving bank applied a reduced two 
tic margin to the exchange of £265,000 because he was going to suffer a loss on the 
exchange rate quoted to him on 13 September 2022. He thinks the receiving bank 
would have applied the same logic to the rate on 23 September 2022 and I agree 
that this is a reasonable assumption to make. I dont think it fair to hold up matters 
further for Mr F by going back to the receiving bank to double-check this first. The 
receiving bank has already confirmed that it doesnt just round a rate up  I think this 
is enough for me to base my decision on.
If the transfer had gone ahead on 23 September 2022 at the wholesale rate plus the 
same margin as on 28 September, based on the information from the receiving bank, 
the rate used is likely to have been 0.8811. 
If the receiving bank had bought £265,000 at the rate of 0.8811 on 23 September 
2022, it seems likely that Mr F would have received 300,760.41 euro rather than the 
294,444.44 euro which he received five days later due to a less favourable exchange 
rate. So, I think it reasonable to require BOI to pay Mr F the exchange loss he 
sustained in the sum of 6,315.97 euro. 
BOI has already agreed to pay 8% interest on the transferred sum of £265,025 from 
23 September 2022 to 28 September 2022. However, as Mr F has been deprived of 
money because of the exchange loss, I think it fair to require BOI to pay interest on 
the exchange loss of 6,315.97 euro from 29 September 2022 to the date of 
settlement. I have used 29 September 2022 as the start point because BOI has 
already agreed to pay interest to 28 September 2022 on the amount it transferred.
When responding to my provisional decision, it would be helpful if Mr F could say 
how hed prefer to receive the exchange loss i.e. in euro or the equivalent amount in 
GBP. BOI will then need to agree with Mr F how to pay the compensation.
I then outlined exactly what steps BOI should take to put things right for Mr F.
Further submissions
Mr F confirmed he had no further information to add and awaited my final decision. BOI 
didnt respond to my provisional decision.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mr F hasnt asked me to consider any further information and BOI hasnt responded, I 
consider it reasonable to make my final decision along the same lines as my provisional 
decision.
Putting things right
BOI should:
Pay Mr F 6,315.97 euro or the equivalent amount in GBP after agreeing with Mr F 
how and where such payment should be made;
Pay 8% simple interest on the sum of £265,025 from 23 September 2022 to 28 
September 2022; 
Pay 8% simple interest on the exchange loss of 6,315.97 euro from 29 September 
2022 to the date of settlement; and
Pay £250 compensation for the trouble and upset caused.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct Bank of Ireland (UK) Plc to put 
things right in line with the above directions.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 October 2023.
