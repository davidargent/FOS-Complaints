The complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc didnt offer him a better deal on his 
credit card debt, although he says it was having regular financial health checks with him.
What happened
Mr A took out a credit card with NatWest in 2009. He said hed been paying a high rate of 
interest on the debt ever since. In October 2018 he moved this credit card debt to a loan, 
which meant he was paying much less interest. Mr A complained that he hadnt been offered 
this sooner. 
NatWest said it would backdate this product switch, moving his debt from a credit card to a 
loan, to his latest financial health check. That was in August 2018. It refunded two months of 
interest to his card, which was £286.47, as well as paying him £50 in compensation.
Mr A said that he thought the change shouldve been offered to him much, much sooner. 
Hed been having financial health checks with NatWest for years, and thought he shouldve 
been offered this better deal a long time ago. But NatWest said it wouldnt backdate the 
change to earlier than this. 
NatWest said it had made a conscious decision not to promote its own products during 
financial health checks or otherwise. It said it had faced mis selling claims, so now it wouldnt 
ever suggest a customer should change to one of its other products. It said that all its 
products are advertised widely, and if customers ask about them, it will of course discuss 
that with them. But it wouldnt make a proactive suggestion, which appears to be what Mr A 
had wanted it to do. 
Our investigator said she couldnt comment on earlier health checks, because NatWest 
didnt keep records of them. But she said we couldnt make NatWest proactively offer Mr A 
alternative products, it was entitled to take a business decision not to offer new products to 
its customers without being asked. She didnt think NatWest had done anything wrong. 
Mr A didnt agree. He wanted our service to look at his health check records which he said 
NatWest shouldve kept. And he said hed been into the branch once or twice a month to pay 
the card too. He still felt he shouldve been offered a loan much sooner. Our investigator said 
that there just arent any records of his financial health checks, and she couldnt make 
NatWest initiate sales of loans if it had decided not to.
Mr A wanted his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman, so it was passed to me for a 
final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator.
I do understand Mr As frustration, that there was a better deal he couldve accessed, and he 
wasnt told about it. Hes asked us to consider his health check records, and also consider 
just how often he was in the branch. 
NatWest has said it doesnt keep records of health checks. And in this case, I dont think 
those records would make any difference. Thats because what Mr A wanted NatWest to do 
 tell him about a better deal on one of its other products  is something that NatWest has 
said it just doesnt do. 
NatWest has explained to us that it wont ever suggest to a customer that they might like to 
take another of its products, without being asked. Its also set out the reasons for that. That 
is a business decision for NatWest to make. Our service wouldnt criticise NatWest for not 
proactively trying to sell customers its products. 
I know Mr A wanted NatWest to offer more proactive advice. But I havent seen anything to 
make me think that its NatWests responsibility to suggest to him changes in how his debt is 
structured, even if those changes might mean hes better off. 
So, although I do understand Mr As frustrations, I cant fairly and reasonably ask NatWest to 
do more than it has already done in this case. 
I know Mr A will be disappointed, but I dont think his complaint should be upheld.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 February 2021.
