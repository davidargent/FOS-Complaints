Mr E complains that CashEuroNet UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid)  was irresponsible to lend 
to him.
background
Mr E took out payday loans from QuickQuid between April 2015 and April 2016 as follows:

£1752.96 paid to close 
the account, 
QuickQuid waived £226.80
Mr E says the loan repayments took so much of his income that it put him in great financial 
difficulty and affected his health.  He told us he had to borrow again, from both QuickQuid 
and other  short-term loan providers.  
He says that if QuickQuid  had done  proper checks it wouldve realised from his borrowing 
history that his debt problems were worsening and it would be irresponsible to continue to 
lend. Mr E says proper checks wouldve shown multiple debts and by the end he wasnt able 
to fully repay the last loan from QuickQuid. 
QuickQuid says it asked  Mr E about his income  and expenditure and was satisfied the 
repayments were affordable based  on the information provided. It says his pattern of 
borrowing did not suggest Mr E was dependent  on the loans.  It noted  that he began to 
experience issues  repaying his last loan when he was unemployed, when it sent him 
information about easier repayment options. 
Ref: DRN90526172Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld in part. She said there  wasnt 
enough information to say QuickQuid  was wrong to approve the first two loans. But she 
found that the repayment amount for loan 3 represented a significant proportion of Mr Es 
declared monthly income of £2,300. She felt that this meant  it was likely that hed have to 
borrow again to be able to make his repayments for this loan. So our adjudicator 
recommended QuickQuid should refund interest  and charges  on loans 3 and 4 (plus 8% 
statutory interest) and that it should  remove any negative information about these loans from 
Mr Es credit  file.
QuickQuid responded  to say, in summary, that it did conduct appropriate  and proportionate 
affordability assessments, including  validation of Mr Es income and it firmly believes its 
checks went far enough to verify his expenses before  funding  all these loans. 
It said that despite the late fees incurred whilst loan 3 was still being repaid,  Mr E did not say 
he was in financial difficulties and that hed gone on to repay loan 3 in full. QuickQuid  
explained that it took all appropriate steps to assist  Mr E once it became clear  his 
circumstances had changed after he took out loan 4 when he became unemployed and it 
accepted a reduced payment to settle  his account. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr E 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mr E. These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr E could  sustainably repay  his loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Ref: DRN90526173Of course loan payments  being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer 
could sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. 
This is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook  (CONC) defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make repayments sustainably  if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Es complaint.
Loans 1 and 2
When Mr E applied  for his first two loans from QuickQuid, he said his income  was £2,300.  
And, after allowing  for expenses, his disposable  income was more  than £1800.  I cant see 
that QuickQuid had any information  that shouldve prompted it to do further  checks at this 
stage. Given that the loan amounts  (£400 each time) were relatively modest compared to the 
disposable income that Mr E declared  I havent  seen anything  to make  me think that 
QuickQuid shouldnt have  approved  these  loans.
Loans 3 onwards
But, by loan 3: 
given that Mr E was borrowing twice  the amount in one go that hed borrowed 
previously, I think at this point QuickQuid shouldve  realised that Mr E was showing 
early indications  that this borrowing was likely to be unaffordable  for him. 
By now,  QuickQuid was aware  that Mr Es disposable income was less than before 
as one of his outgoings had increased quite substantially. 
And the amount he had to repay on this loan was a significant  proportion of his 
monthly income (which hadnt changed). 
QuickQuid provided Mr E with loan 4 within three  months  or so of him settling  loan 3 
 despite the warning  signs that his borrowing was now becoming unsustainable. 
And this time hed borrowed a substantial amount, and topped this up barely 2 weeks  
later with another loan  taking his overall  borrowing  from QuickQuid to the largest 
amount overall  that hed ever borrowed  from it. 
At this stage I think QuickQuid should have taken steps to independently verify 
Mr Es financial position. Had it done so it wouldve  seen  that he was spending large  
amounts on what appear to be gambling  transactions. And it wouldve seen that he 
was exceeding  his overdraft limit on a number of occasions.  
I think QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more  likely  than not Mr E was having  
to borrow further to cover  a shortfall  in his finances  and that Mr Es indebtedness was 
generally increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN90526174Looked at overall, Mr E wasnt making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed. 
Loan 4 was taken out almost exactly a year after Mr Es first QuickQuid loan  and it 
was for around two and half times the amount of loan 1. Mr E had paid large  amounts  
of interest to, in effect, service a debt over an extended period.
I think Mr E lost out because QuickQuid  continued  to lend from loan 3 onwards because 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Es indebtedness by allowing him to take 
expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loan 3 onwards and QuickQuid should put things  right.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to give Mr E:
loan 3 (on 3 November 2015)
loan 4 (on 11 April 2015) 
or the top up on 23 April 2016  (shown  as loan 4a in my table) 
So for each of those  loans  QuickQuid  should
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr E paid on loans 3,4 and 4a;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about these loans from Mr Es credit file.
As Mr E has already had the benefit  of the amount QuickQuid  waived  (£226.80), QuickQuid 
can deduct this amount  from the overall  amount it owes Mr E.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr E a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mr Es complaint. CashEuroNet UK LLC 
(trading as QuickQuid) should pay Mr E as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision  before 22 August 2019.
