The complaint
Mr P is unhappy with how Allianz Insurance Plc dealt with a motor insurance claim as a 
county court judgement was entered against him.
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusion reached by the investigator that the case should 
be upheld. I do so for the following reasons:
I acknowledge the third party in this instance didnt follow correct process and notify 
Allianz of the judgement. However, as Allianz has acknowledged, in light of the 
nature of the incident as a whole, it could have been more proactive in contacting the 
third party to avoid the claim reaching that stage. 
Receiving a county court judgement would have undoubtedly caused Mr P stress and 
worry, which could have easily been avoided. I think £300 compensation, rather than 
£150, more fairly reflects the trouble and upset Mr P was caused. Allianz should also 
cover the fee for the satisfaction certificate Mr P obtained.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold the complaint and I direct Allianz Insurance Plc to pay Mr P 
£300 compensation and reimburse him the cost of the satisfaction certificate. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 March 2022.
