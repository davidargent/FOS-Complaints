Our adjudicator partially upheld Mrs Rs complaint and thought the loans from loan three 
onwards shouldnt have been given. They also thought all information about the borrowing 
from loan six onwards was adverse and should be removed from Mrs Rs credit file. 
Sunny disagreed but offered to uphold the complaint from loan 16 onwards. Mrs R didnt 
want to accept the offer.
As the complaint remains unresolved, it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs R could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs R could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mrs R didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one and two shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mrs R had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Rs complaint. After doing so Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why.
I agree with the adjudicator that when Mrs R applied for loan three her borrowing behaviour 
suggested she may have been having problems managing her money. I say this because 
when Mrs R applied for loan three, she already had loans one and two outstanding. She had 
taken one loan each month and the amounts borrowed were increasing. When loan three 
was taken, Mrs R had borrowed a total of £950 and the monthly repayments increased 
accordingly. 
If Sunny had looked to build a bigger picture of Mrs Rs financial circumstances it would have 
seen that she was using at least one other short-term credit provider. So, taking into account 
the lending Mrs R already had outstanding with Sunny, and her borrowing from another 
short-term credit provider, I dont think it was fair for Sunny to have allowed Mrs R any 
further borrowing at loan three and after. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Rs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan six. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs R was not managing to repay her 
loans sustainably. Mrs R had taken out six loans within six months. So Sunny ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs R was having to borrow further to 
cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that 
     Mrs Rs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mrs Rs first loan was for £250 and loan six was for £200, so the borrowing was not 
significantly decreasing.  At this point Sunny ought to have known that Mrs R was not 
likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing 
need. 
From loan six onwards Mrs R was provided with a new loan within days or weeks of 
settling a previous one. And I note Mrs R was repaying her loans before the agreed 
term of the loan but would then return for more borrowing. While I appreciate this 
would have saved Mrs R interest costs, bearing in mind the nature of short-term 
lending, I would question why someone would repay one loan early only to come 
back shortly afterwards for further borrowing. And in some instances, this 
reborrowing was for a larger amount than the loan that was repaid. 
Mrs R wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 23 was 
taken out more than two and half years after Mrs Rs first. And it was for a larger 
amount. Mrs R had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mrs R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan six 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Rs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of 
time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mrs R borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mrs Rs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans three onwards and 
Sunny should put things right.
 Putting things right
refund all interest and charges Mrs R paid on loans three to 23;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans three to five from Mrs Rs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan six onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans six to 23 should be removed from 
Mrs Rs credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
 My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mrs Rs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 May 2020.Catherine Langley
