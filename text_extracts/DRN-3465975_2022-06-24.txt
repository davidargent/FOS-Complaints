The complaint
Mr B complains that National Westminster Bank Plc charged him an early repayment charge 
(ERC) when he redeemed his mortgage. He said that he paid it back early because of the 
impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and he doesnt think it was fair to charge the full ERC 
when there were only two months of the ERC period left.
What happened
Mr B had a mortgage with NatWest. He had two separate sub-accounts, each with different 
interest rates:
 A fixed rate of 2.18%, ending in March 2021; and
A fixed rate of 3.68%, ending in September 2022.
The first sub-account had an ERC of 2% of the balance on that part, chargeable until 31 
March 2020, reducing to 1% between then and 31 March 2021. The second (which resulted 
from some additional borrowing Mr B had previously taken out) had an ERC of 2% if the 
mortgage was repaid before 30 September 2021, and 1% between then and 30 September 
2022.
In January 2021, Mr B got in touch with NatWest to ask for a redemption statement. The 
mortgage was repaid on 27 January, and Mr B was charged an ERC of just under £3,000 in 
total  of which around £2,400 was in respect of sub-account 1 and the rest for sub-account 
2.
Mr B complained. He said that it wasnt fair to charge the full ERC when he was so close to 
the end of the ERC period on sub-account 1. He also said that NatWest had an obligation to 
help borrowers impacted by the pandemic and hadnt helped him. He offered to settle his 
complaint if NatWest refunded half of the ERC.
NatWest didnt agree to that, so Mr B brought his complaint to us. Our investigator didnt 
think it should be upheld, so Mr B asked for it to be reviewed by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr Bs mortgage offer clearly sets out that theres an ERC, how it will be calculated and 
when it will apply until  and so does his additional borrowing offer.
So Im satisfied that there was an ERC applicable when Mr B redeemed his mortgage when 
he did  and that, under the terms of the mortgage, NatWest was entitled to charge the ERC.
Ive then gone on to think about whether it was fair for NatWest to have charged the ERC in 
these circumstances.
Mr B says it wasnt fair to charge the full ERC on sub-account 1 when there was only two 
months left of the ERC period.
But the mortgage offer makes clear that the ERC will apply right up to 31 March 2021, and 
Mr B redeemed his mortgage before that date. When setting an ERC, NatWest doesnt need 
to think about the point at which Mr Bs mortgage has ended, or how much it would lose on 
this specific mortgage in this specific situation. Its entitled, under the rules of mortgage 
regulation, to set a fixed ERC across a range of mortgages on the basis that the proportion 
of those mortgages that end early are likely, across the board, to result in ERCs being paid 
that reflect the costs of them ending early across the board. And given it cant know exactly 
what those costs would be when it offers the mortgages  because it cant know when or if 
any individual one would end early  its entitled to do so on the basis of an estimate.
Im satisfied thats what NatWest did in this case, and therefore that the ERC on Mr Bs 
mortgage was set in line with the rules.
And Im satisfied that NatWest made clear to Mr B before he redeemed his mortgage how 
much the ERC would be  its clearly set out on the redemption statement.
Mr Bs said that he paid the mortgage back early because he was impacted by the 
coronavirus pandemic. Im sorry to hear that, though he hasnt told us in any detail how it 
affected him. Nevertheless, I know that this was a very difficult time for lots of people, and 
had a big impact on the income of many people and households across the country.
However, Mr B didnt discuss this with NatWest at the time. I can see that in 2020, Mr B 
asked NatWest for permission to rent the property out, but then said he hadnt been able to 
go ahead with that because of lockdown. But he didnt tell NatWest that he was in any 
financial difficulty, and didnt  for example  ask for a payment deferral at any point.
He asked for a redemption statement in January 2021, NatWest sent him one and he repaid 
his mortgage. But theres no record that Mr B told NatWest  either then, or in 2020  that he 
was experiencing financial difficulty because of the pandemic. He hadnt missed any 
payments. He didnt tell NatWest why he was redeeming the mortgage. And so its difficult 
for me to say that NatWest should have done more to offer him support when he didnt make 
NatWest aware of any reason why it should have done so.
Taking all that into account, I think NatWest set the ERC on a fair basis. It told Mr B how 
much it would be, and when it would apply until. NatWest wasnt aware of any particular 
difficulties in Mr Bs situation. When Mr B redeemed his mortgage within the ERC period, it 
was fair and reasonable to charge him the ERC and I dont think NatWest needs to refund 
any part of the ERC now.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 July 2022.
