The complaint
Miss M complains that Lloyds Bank PLC (Lloyds) wont refund over £23,000 she lost to a 
romance/investment scam.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat everything 
again here. In brief summary, Miss M fell victim to a romance scam beginning in May 2021 
after she met someone (the scammer) on a dating app.
The scammer spoke to Miss M about cryptocurrency and encouraged her to invest in it after 
he explained how much money he was making. Miss M opened an account with Binance, 
Coinbase and NYCEX and started buying cryptocurrency from her Lloyds account across 
the following transactions.

After making these payments from her Lloyds account, the cryptocurrency was then 
transferred on again to the scammer under the guise of her placing trades in the fake 
investment. Miss M eventually realised shed been scammed when she was unable to 
withdraw any of her profits.
Miss M reported the fraud to Lloyds, but it refused to refund the money shed lost as it said 
shed authorised the payments. Unhappy with this, Miss M referred the matter to our service. 
Our investigator upheld the complaint. She didnt think the first eight payments Miss M made 
as part of the scam would have appeared particularly unusual or out of character, so they 
wouldnt have required any intervention by Lloyds. However, when she came to make the 
£12,000 payment on 30 June 2021, the investigator thought that this amount was 
significantly out of character, such that Lloyds should have made further enquiries before 
processing it. Had it done so, she thought any further financial loss to the scam could have 
been prevented, so the investigator asked that Lloyds refund the payments made from this 
point onwards.
In terms of interest, the investigator noted that Miss M had borrowed £11,000 from a friend 
on 29 June 2021 in order to fund further investment payments. As a result, she didnt think it 
would be fair to ask Lloyds to pay any interest on the first £11,000 of the award, but that it 
should pay 8% simple interest on the residual amount. 
Lloyds agreed to settle the complaint on this basis, but Miss M disagreed. She thought that 
the first eight payments shouldve also been considered as out of character and said that 
Lloyds failed to protect her. As she disagreed, the matter has been escalated to me to 
determine.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold it for the same reasons as the investigator, and I do 
not think Lloyds needs to offer anything over and above the amount it has already agreed to 
refund. Ill explain why.
It isnt in dispute that Miss M has fallen victim to a cruel scam here, nor that she authorised 
the payments. Lloyds has also accepted that it should have intervened when she made the 
£12,000 payment on 30 June 2021, and that it could have likely prevented any further loss if 
it had done so. Given these points are no longer in dispute, I do not intend to explore them 
any further.
What remains in dispute by Miss M is whether Lloyds ought fairly and reasonably to have 
intervened sooner than the £12,000 payment. But having considered the payments made 
prior to this, Im not persuaded there was reasonable cause for it to have done so. 
I appreciate that, between transactions one and eight, Miss M made payments totalling over 
£11,000, which is a significant amount of money. But this amount wasnt paid in one large or 
out of character transaction like the £12,000 payment was. It was paid in eight separate 
smaller increments spread over the space of a month which, in my judgment, would not have 
appeared particularly unusual or out of character when compared with Miss Ms spending 
history. So, Im not persuaded Lloyds ought to have considered any of the first eight 
payments as suspicious or indicating that Miss M might have been at risk of falling victim to 
a scam. The payments were not of such an amount, for example, that they represented a 
significant deviation from the sort of payments Miss M had made before. There also were not 
any suspicious sequence of payments for Lloyds to have detected either, such as multiple 
payments with a cumulatively large value being made in quick succession. 
As a result, Im not persuaded there was anything that ought reasonably to have triggered 
Lloyds fraud monitoring systems prior to the £12,000 payment on 30 June 2021, as the prior payments would not have suggested a heightened risk of financial harm. 
Miss M has not disputed the interest award on the settlement offer, so I dont consider it 
necessary to explore this any further either, but Im also satisfied its fair for Lloyds not to pay 
any interest on the first £11,000 of the award given the £12,000 payment was funded by 
money lent to Miss M by her friend. Im therefore satisfied that Lloyds offer to settle this case 
is fair, and I do not think it needs to pay anything further.
For the avoidance of doubt, I also dont think there was anything further Lloyds could have 
done to recover the payments after the fraud was reported, given the payments were sent to 
Miss Ms own crypto wallets before being sent on again to the scammer. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct Lloyds Bank PLC to:
Refund payments nine and ten listed in the payment table above  totalling £12,100
Pay 0% interest on the first £11,000 of this award, and 8% simple interest per year 
thereafter on the residual amount from the date the payments were made to the date 
of settlement. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 January 2024.
