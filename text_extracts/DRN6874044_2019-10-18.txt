K820x#14complaint
Mr H2 complains  on behalf  of his mother Mrs H that National Westminster  Bank  Plc 
(NatWest) has lost a number  of documents that were in its safe keeping.
background
Mr H2 believes NatWest has lost a signed copy of his fathers will that it held in safe custody. 
Ill refer to Mr H2s father as Mr H.
Without this will Mr H2 has explained hes unable to get a grant  of probate  for Mr Hs estate. 
He says this means  Mrs H is liable for inheritance tax and may lose her home.
NatWest said it had checked its database and spoken to its solicitors,  but hadnt  been able 
to trace  the original will. It paid Mr H2 £150  compensation  to apologise for the trouble and 
upset caused.  However  its now confirmed that it doesnt think it made  any error here. Its 
confident that any wills lodged with it by Mr and Mrs H were discharged some time ago.
Mr H2 also thinks NatWest has lost some  other  documents deposited with it by Mr H. Hes 
told us an insurance  company has requested  a copy of original policy  documents before it 
will settle Mr Hs life assurance policies.  And he thinks  these were  lodged with NatWest.  But 
NatWest says its carried out extensive  searches and cant find these documents.
Our investigator didnt  think there was sufficient evidence to conclude NatWest had done 
anything wrong  here. But Mr H2 disagreed.
I issued a provisional decision to both parties  on 15 August 2019. A copy  of this is attached 
below as it forms part of this final decision.  In it I explained why I didnt feel there was 
sufficient evidence for me to conclude that NatWest had lost the documents concerned  
here.
NatWest didnt make any comments on my provisional decision. But Mr H2, acting on behalf  
of Mrs H, sent a detailed response  alongside  some further evidence for my consideration. In 
summary he said:
the wills
He feels Mr Hs written  instructions show that all three wills were  lodged with NatWest.  
And that as NatWest were the executor for all three wills he thinks  it should have kept a 
record of their location regardless of where they were stored.  
NatWest branch  employees referred to its document storage area as being very 
disorganized and mostly uncatalogued. And hes been  told that NatWest  has a reputation  
for losing wills and documents.  
He thinks its plausible there could have  been  a mix up with Mr Hs wills because they 
were lodged  prior to the barcode  system  used to identify them.  And he feels the fact 
NatWest hasnt  been able to evidence  it carried out its procedures  for discharging them  
from safe custody gives reasonable doubt as to which wills were  discharged.  
the insurance documents
He provided a letter from Mr Hs insurer to NatWest that he feels  shows the policy  
documents were  lodged with the bank.
Ref: DRN68740442He said its unacceptable for NatWest  to have made mistakes such as saying it had 
discharged a policy document to the insurer, when its now confirmed this wasnt the 
case.
He feels there was an inaccuracy in my provisional decision.  He said its incorrect  that 
reference numbers  for the insurance documents were  found on handwritten  ledgers.  
Rather, he was told by a NatWest branch  manager - who was told by its securities team  - 
that it had two documents and would  send these out to him. So he believes that the 
NatWest securities team has computerized records detailing  what should be held in safe 
custody, but that on physically  looking for the documents they cannot be found. 
He agrees  NatWest  isnt in possession of the documents now. But feels that given there 
are NatWest  reference numbers for the documents,  they must have at some  point been 
its possession.  
So now I need to make a final decision.
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
As I explained in my provisional decision,  where  evidence is incomplete or contradictory (as 
it is here) then I have  to base my decision on the balance of probabilities  that is, what  is 
most likely to have happened. 
Id like to thank Mr H2 for the detailed response  he provided to my provisional decision.  
Whilst Ive only summarised  this above, Id like to assure him I have taken everything he said 
into consideration when reaching  this final decision. And I hope  he wont  take it as a 
discourtesy that Ive concentrated my findings on what I consider to be the key points here.
I appreciate that Mr H2, on behalf of Mrs H, will be disappointed that I havent  reached a 
different conclusion to the one that I set out in my provisional decision. But Im still not 
persuaded that, on the basis of the evidence available, it would be fair for me to conclude 
that NatWest has lost the documents concerned  here.  Ill explain  why.
the will
I appreciate Mr H2 feels strongly that three wills were lodged  with NatWest.  And hes 
provided further copies  of instructions left by Mr H concerning his affairs. But I still havent 
seen conclusive evidence  that this was the case.  So whilst I understand why Mr H2 feels  its 
possible that NatWest  has lost at least one of these wills, the information hes provided 
doesnt make me think that my provisional findings  in respect  of the missing will(s) were 
wrong.  
I note Mr H2 feels NatWest  should have had a record of where all three of Mr Hs wills were  
stored regardless of whether or not they were  in its safe keeping.  Hes provided us with a 
copy of an old NatWest  brochure which says The executed  will and any Codicils may of 
course be deposited with the Bank  for safe custody, but in any event it is important that we 
are told where the executed Will and any Codicils are deposited.  
Ref: DRN68740443Weve asked NatWest  for more information  about  this and its confirmed that it doesnt keep 
a record of any documents that arent lodged with it. And given this brochures age I dont 
think its necessarily indicative of NatWests  current process in respect  of these matters. So I 
havent concluded that its made a mistake  by not recording  this information either.
the insurance documents
Mr H has explained that some of the information  contained about these documents  in my 
provisional decision was wrong. He says the only two ledger entries found were in relation to 
the missing wills. But that he was told by a NatWest branch manager last year - who was 
informed by its securities team - that it was in possession of two of Mr Hs life assurance  
policy documents. 
Weve asked NatWest  to provide us with any further information it has in light of Mr H2s 
suggestion that its securities team  has records which  detail that these documents should  be 
in its safe custody. But its confirmed its already given us all of the information if holds in 
respect of this matter   and I havent  seen  anything that suggests  this is the case.  
Mr H2 has also provided a copy of a letter sent to NatWest by Mr Hs insurer in respect  of 
one of the missing  documents that states that the above policy  was assigned to NatWest  on 
1 September 1987 and I enclose a copy of correspondence from NatWest Iron Gate  branch 
in Derby confirming the assignment. He feels this shows that NatWest had  and has lost  
these documents.  
I know Mr H2 will be disappointed, but I havent reached the same conclusion.  I dont think 
the insurance companys use of the word assigned here necessarily means that NatWest  
were sent the original  policy  document for safe keeping. Life insurance  or assurance policies 
can sometimes be assigned to a third party  meaning that the third party becomes a 
beneficiary of the policy. And Mr H has suggested  NatWest were the beneficiary here. But I 
dont think that it would have necessarily had to retain a copy of the original policy  document  
for this to be the case. Mr H2 has also made reference to the documentation mentioned in 
this letter.  But as I havent seen this, I dont  think I can reasonably infer what  might have 
been included.  
Its clear NatWest  did previously provide some misleading information when it suggested a 
policy document had been discharged to the insurer. I acknowledged  this in my provisional 
decision. And I appreciate why Mr H2 is so frustrated about it. But I dont think  this was done 
tactically as hes suggested. And for the reasons outlined above I still dont feel I can 
reasonably conclude that its more  likely  than not NatWest has lost documents here.  
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint for the reasons Ive outlined above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H2, on behalf 
of Mrs H, to accept or reject  my decision before 18 November 2019.

extensive searches and cant find these documents.
Our investigator didnt think there was sufficient  evidence  to conclude NatWest  had done anything  
wrong here. Mr H2 has given us a detailed  response to explain why he disagrees with this view. So 
the case  has been passed  to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Where evidence  is incomplete or contradictory (as it is here) then I 
have to base my decision on the balance of probabilities   that is, what is most  likely to have 
happened. 
Having looked at everything both sides have provided  here, I dont feel that I can conclude that 
NatWest has lost any of these documents based on the evidence provided. So I wont be asking it to 
do anything further. I know Mr H2 and Mrs H will be very disappointed with this, but Ill explain why.
the will
Mr H2 believes that Mr H lodged  three wills with NatWest for safe keeping - individual wills for Mr H 
and Mrs H, and a joint will. I can see NatWests solicitors have suggested its unlikely three wills would 
have been prepared. But Mr H2 has shown us a copy of instructions left by Mr H which  do refer to 
three wills. So I have no reason to doubt that three wills were in existence at one time or another. 
However, I havent  seen conclusive evidence  that all three wills were lodged  with NatWest for safe 
keeping. Mr Hs instructions state  that NatWest is the executor for his will. But they dont confirm  that 
NatWest held signed copies  of all three wills in their possession. Ive seen a letter from NatWest 
confirming receipt of Mr H and Mrs Hs wills in 1983. But it doesnt specify  how many  wills there were. 
And Mr H2 has told us hes spoken to the solicitors who prepared two of the wills. Which suggests to 
me that the third will was prepared at a different time. And I have to consider that its possible different 
arrangements could  have been made for its safe keeping.
Ref: DRN68740445NatWest has shown us that two wills were withdrawn from its safe custody  in 2009. I understand Mr 
H2 feels it should be able to show him signed receipts to confirm these withdrawals.  But Im satisfied 
that, on balance, its more likely than not two wills were withdrawn at this time given the evidence it 
has been able to show us, which consists of a discharge note signed by a bank employee. 
This discharge note advises  that the wills for Mr H and Mrs H were lodged  with NatWest on 26 
January 1983. And it states that Mr Hs will was discharged on 28 May 2009,  and Mrs Hs will was 
discharged on 8 June 2009. 
Mr H2 thinks that its likely that if two wills were withdrawn  at this time they were  actually
Mrs Hs will and his parents  joint will. He thinks its likely NatWest are either still in possession of, or 
have lost, Mr Hs individual will. 
I appreciate Mr H2 feels there is reason to doubt what is written on the discharge note. But I havent 
seen the two wills that were discharged, or any other evidence to suggest  that the description on the 
note was incorrect. So I dont think I can fairly  conclude that any error was made  in this respect.  
Im very sorry to hear of Mr Hs passing. I appreciate  this is a difficult time for Mr H2 and Mrs H. I also 
understand the severity  of the implications of Mr Hs will not being located. But I havent seen  any 
evidence that I think means I can reasonably conclude  that NatWest has lost Mr Hs will.
the insurance  documents
Mr H2 says that NatWest  has also lost some  of Mr Hs life assurance policy  documents. Hes shown 
us evidence that Mr H withdrew a number of documents from NatWests  safe custody in 1995.  But 
has explained  that Mr H also had two other sequentially numbered policies. NatWest says it cant 
locate these policy documents. But Mr H2 believes it was in possession of them last year. Hes 
explained that when  he went  into a NatWest  branch  the branch  manager spoke to its securities team  
and passed on two reference numbers  to him.
NatWest has given us a statement from the member  of staff who assisted Mr H in branch. Shes  
explained that the reference  numbers she gave to Mr H2 were old reference numbers shed  found on 
some handwritten ledgers. But that she thought theyd been released  to the customer, so she advised  
Mr H2 to try and locate receipts and check with solicitors around  the additional dates  shed provided 
to him. So I dont think NatWest was in possession of the documents themselves when Mr H2 was 
quoted these  reference numbers. Rather they were given to him to help him locate the documents, or 
any further details about their lodging with NatWest  which would assist  NatWest in making  further 
searches for them.
Mr H2 has explained  NatWest were a beneficiary  of one of Mr Hs policies that he is now unable to 
locate. Hes told us he asked the bank to send a letter of no interest to the insurer  last year. NatWest 
confirmed it did this. It also told us previously that it had sent the original policy document with this 
letter.
Weve asked  NatWest for more details about  this as Mr H2 has confirmed  NatWest didnt  have 
permission to discharge  any policy  documents. NatWest has now advised that it did not send the 
policy document to the insurer. Its shown  us a copy of the letter  that it did send. And I can see the 
letter doesnt  make any reference to the policy  document. Nor does the insurers letter which NatWest 
were responding to. 
Taking all of this into account, I dont think there is any evidence that NatWest had these policy 
documents last year. In these  circumstances  Id expect  to see NatWest has done all it can to try and 
locate the documents Mr H2 believes it has. And its explained it has undertaken extensive searches 
but not found  anything. 
Ref: DRN68740446I know Mr H2 is frustrated  by the lack of information NatWest  has been able to provide to confirm  
what happened to these documents. And I appreciate it doesnt have any evidence to confirm  that 
they were discharged. But, in situations like this, evidence can be limited because of the time thats 
passed. So I have to impartially consider what information is available and reach my findings based 
on this.
I should  also add at this point that I havent seen any evidence to confirm  that these missing policy  
documents were definitely  lodged,  or are still lodged, with NatWest. The instructions left by Mr H refer 
to one insurance policy  and simply advise that the policy document should also be sent to the insurer  
if the latter can be found. He doesnt  state  it was being  held by NatWest.  
So I know Mr H2 and Mrs H will be disappointed,  but again, on the basis of the evidence provided, I 
dont think it would be fair for me to conclude that NatWest has lost these  documents.
my provisional  decision
My provisional  decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint for the reasons Ive outlined above.
