The complaint
Mr B complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has funded payment made from his 
PayPal account via PayPal credit without his permission. This has resulted in him incurring 
interest. 
What happened
Mr B makes payments to service providers from his bank account via his PayPal account. 
He also has an available credit balance through PayPal. 
In January 2020, Mr B raised a chargeback though his bank for a transaction which took 
place through PayPal. This meant his bank account was no longer available as a funding 
source for payment requests and so they reverted to the next available funding source  
PayPal credit. This wasnt known to Mr B at the time and when he noticed the transactions 
he complained. 
As he never received a response, he attempted to complain via other channels. And he 
referred his complaint to us when he received no reply. While we were progressing Mr Bs 
complaint he told us this had happened again in June 2020.  
PayPal told us that Mr B had been complaining through the incorrect channels. It also 
showed it did reply to his concerns in March, asking for details of the transactions in 
question, but Mr B didnt reply. 
It said as Mr Bs bank account was no longer available as a funding source, payments 
reverted to the next available source. It said Mr B had changed this back to his bank account 
in March 2020. It also said Mr B had raised another chargeback for a PayPal transaction in 
June 2020 which resulted in payments again reverting to credit. Once again Mr B 
subsequently changed this back to his bank account.  
Our investigator upheld the complaint. She considered the information Mr B was sent when 
a payment had been attempted following a chargeback, and she didnt think it was clear     
Mr Bs bank account wouldnt be available for further transactions until such time as he 
reinstated his bank account as his funding source. She also found that Mr Bs initial 
complaint should have been forwarded on correctly, or at the very least acknowledged. She 
asked PayPal to refund any interest applied (and any charges associated with that) and pay 
Mr B £250 for the distress and inconvenience caused. 
PayPal has asked for the matter to be referred to an ombudsman. In summary it has said:
Mr B is continually reporting that his bank account is being used fraudulently. He is 
aware of this as each time his bank account isnt available, and he reactivates it 
again for purchases. 
Mr B wasnt using the correct channels for making a complaint. Whilst a response 
may have previously been received from a senior vice president there is no 
guarantee such contact will be forwarded on as it is not the correct channel. The 
correct process is outlined in the user agreement. 
Mr B didnt respond to its request for confirmation of the transactions in question. 
Mr B had also said this had happened previously, he raised a complaint and was told it was 
an error on PayPals part. Mr B has also said he has a bank card attached to the account 
which should have been used instead of PayPal credit.  
The matter was referred to me for a decision. In order to ensure I had all the necessary 
information needed to reach a fair and reasonable decision, I asked for the following:
Q What was it about the chargebacks that meant transactions reverted to PayPal 
credit?
A PayPal explained this was an automatic system measure to prevent any additional 
losses to the account holder. 
A copy of the previous complaint correspondence so I could see what Mr B had been 
told about this before.
PayPal has confirmed it has no record of a previous complaint made about this. And 
Mr B explained he didnt have any complaint correspondence as this had been dealt 
with over the phone. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.The starting position for any complaint of this type is the terms and conditions. They can be 
found in PayPals user agreement. Under Funding payments you send from your account 
its explained that:
We will obtain electronic money for the payment you send from your account from 
the following sources in the following order [my emphasis] to the extent they are 
available:
1. Special funding arrangements (if available for the given transaction
2. Preferred funding source (if selected and available)
3. Pre-existing PayPal balance
4. Bank account (instant transfer via bank mandate)
5. PayPal credit (where available)
6. PayPal branded debit card (where available)
7. PayPal branded credit card (where available)
8. Debit card
9. Credit card
10. Bank account (eCheque)
According to the terms, if Mr Bs bank account isnt available (4) then the transaction is taken 
from PayPal credit where that is available. So although Mr B may have attached a bank card 
to the account, there is a set hierarchy that is followed as to where payments come from. I 
therefore dont find that PayPal was wrong, per se, to debit transactions from the credit when 
Mr Bs bank account was no longer available for transactions. 
However, I do need to take into account that it isnt explained in the user agreement that if a 
chargeback is filed for a PayPal transaction that prevents further transactions being taken 
from the bank account. I accept that not all scenarios can be covered in terms and 
conditions, so this might not feature there. I have therefore considered the correspondence 
sent to Mr B.  
The notification PayPal sent in January 2020 following a recent chargeback did explain the 
transaction couldnt be completed from the bank account.  But it didnt explain that future 
transactions wouldnt be completed from the bank account either unless the funding source 
was changed back to it. So it wouldnt have been clear to Mr B what was happening or why; 
therefore he wouldnt have had sufficient information in order to prevent incurring further 
interest costs associated with using PayPal credit. Given the available evidence, I can 
understand why Mr B thought PayPal had simply changed his payment method.
PayPal has argued Mr B is aware of this process as he reactivates his account. Im not 
persuaded Mr B changing his payment method back is evidence he is aware of what 
happens when a chargeback is raised or that the account automatically reverts to the next 
funding method. It is only evidence of Mr B changing his payment method back to what he 
originally wanted. Indeed, I dont think this was made clear until I asked about it. I therefore 
dont find this argument persuasive. 
As I dont find the information provided to Mr B was clear, I find it fair for the interest charged 
on those transactions to be refunded  the account should revert to what it would have been 
as if those transactions had been made from the bank account rather than PayPal credit. 
Going forward Mr B will be aware of what a chargeback will result in, and that if a payment 
cant be made from his bank account the next funding source is PayPal credit. 
I understand Mr B attempted to query this through various channels. As PayPal points out, 
there are set routes for queries and complaints that Mr B really ought to be using. Using 
some of the methods he did meant he was using invalid email addresses and using references for complaints already dealt with and not relevant to this new issue  I dont think 
it was clear to PayPal this was a different matter. I have also taken into account that PayPal 
did respond to Mr B on 4 March 2020 asking for details of the transactions in question, but 
Mr B didnt reply. 
But I dont think it would be fair to ignore that Mr B did contact a valid email address in 
February 2020, albeit not following the correct process, and seemingly no steps were taken 
to forward that on to the correct department or even acknowledge it. Had that happened, this 
all could have been cleared up much sooner than it was, and Mr B wouldnt have been put to 
the additional trouble to get an answer to his concerns. 
Overall, I find that PayPal could have communicated more clearly with Mr B about what had 
happened on his account and what that meant going forward. I also think Mr Bs concerns 
should have been acknowledged and forwarded on accordingly. Because if this, in addition 
to incurring interest charges, Mr B has been put to trouble over and above that to be 
expected from raising concerns, that he should be fairly compensated for.    
My final decision
For the reasons given I uphold this complaint. I require PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA to:
Refund the interest charges for the transactions made from PayPal credit from 6 
January 2020 to 9 March 2020 and the transaction which took place on 25 June 
2020. The account should revert to what it would have been as if those transactions 
had been made from Mr Bs bank account rather than PayPay credit. 
Pay Mr B £250 for the distress and inconvenience this matter caused.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 November 2020.
