The complaint
Ms S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wouldnt lend on a property she wanted 
to buy because the service charge was too high, and wouldnt reconsider when charges 
were reduced. She ended up paying expensive fees, which NatWest wouldnt refund.
What happened
Ms S said she wanted NatWest to move her mortgage to a new property she was buying. 
She paid the valuation fee, but NatWests valuer then said the service charge for her new 
property was too high, and would put people off buying. 
Ms S said she then negotiated the charge down to a level which she felt was exceptionally 
reasonable for this kind of property. But NatWest still wouldnt offer her a mortgage, and it 
wouldnt tell her what an acceptable level of service charge would be. It wouldnt get a 
second opinion on the valuation. It wouldnt pay her back the valuation fee. 
Ms S said shed since got a mortgage without difficulty elsewhere, but she had to pay a large 
early redemption charge (ERC). And then NatWest charged her for her monthly mortgage 
payment after shed left the bank.
NatWest said that the valuation fee Ms S paid isnt refundable if the reason the mortgage 
doesnt go ahead is because of something that shows up in the valuation. It sent us the 
mortgage illustration, which confirmed this. 
NatWest said it just isnt an expert on property valuations, so it relies on people who are 
expert. And in this case, it confirmed that it had asked a surveyor with the appropriate 
professional qualifications and memberships to value Ms Ss property. That surveyor said 
that the property wouldnt be suitable security because of the onerous service charges. 
NatWest said that it didnt think this was a mistake. It relied on what its surveyor said, and it 
wouldnt ask for another valuation.
NatWest explained some of the reasons why banks charge ERCs on mortgages. It said 
Ms S only had to pay the ERC if she wanted to go ahead with this property, because 
NatWest wouldnt lend on this one. But if she wanted to look for somewhere else, NatWest 
would be happy to consider that.
NatWest accepted that it took a direct debit from Ms S at the end of December 2021, 
although Ms S had already paid to redeem her mortgage. But it said it returned the money 
promptly to Ms S. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said that each lender has its 
own criteria for what type of lending it wants to be involved in and the risks its willing to take. 
And the valuation of the property is part of that assessment. Lenders usually rely on an 
expert to provide a valuation, and thats what NatWest had done. 
Our investigator didnt think NatWest was wrong to then rely on the valuation report. Our 
investigator said lenders dont all allow applicants to appeal a valuation, and NatWest didnt 
have to do so. He said he could see why NatWest would prefer to just work with its own 
valuers, and get a consistent approach. 
Our investigator said it might not be helpful for a lender to share lending criteria, as it might 
encourage buyers and sellers to negotiate something that would come within those criteria. 
This could be a particular risk with thinks like service charges, which can of course change. 
Our investigator said Ms S had been notified when she took out her mortgage that shed 
have to pay an ERC if she paid off her mortgage very quickly. Shed hoped to avoid paying 
this by porting her old mortgage product across to her new home. But when the valuation 
suggested NatWest shouldnt lend on that property, Ms S had redeemed her mortgage and 
gone ahead with her purchase. That meant she had to pay an ERC, and her valuation fee 
wasnt refunded. Our investigator didnt think NatWest was wrong to charge the ERC, or not 
to refund the valuation. 
Our investigator said its quite usual for a direct debit to stay in place when a mortgage is 
redeemed, and for it to remain until the funds to redeem the mortgage have cleared. That 
means if theres any problem at all with the redemption, the customer doesnt end up with a 
missed mortgage payment. 
Our investigator didnt think that NatWest had acted unreasonably or treated Ms S unfairly.
Ms S didnt agree. She said NatWest shouldnt be able to get away with what it has done on 
technicalities. She was adamant that her property was suitable for a mortgage, and said 
NatWest had only refused so it could levy huge fees on her, unfairly. She said NatWest has 
a duty to treat customers fairly, and that wasnt what had happened here. She wanted an 
ombudsman to consider her complaint, so it was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator.
NatWest has been clear throughout that there was no issue with continuing to lend to Ms S, 
after she moved. Its concerns were about the property that Ms S wanted to buy. Those 
stemmed from the valuation report, which said the service charge was too high. 
I do think its reasonable for NatWest to instruct a properly qualified expert to carry out 
valuations for it. And thats what it did here.
Our service doesnt consider what a surveyor did. So Im not looking here at the surveyors 
conclusion about the property Ms S wanted to buy. Im looking at how NatWest responded to 
that conclusion. And I do think its reasonable for NatWest to rely on the valuation it 
requested. 
So I dont think it was unreasonable for NatWest to say it just wouldnt lend on this property. I 
know that Ms S negotiated a reduction in the service charges. And Ive no reason to think 
this wasnt genuine. But I have to take into account that NatWest was aware these charges 
had, historically, been much higher. And it wouldnt be able to tell whether this reduction 
would continue after the sale. For that reason, I dont think its unreasonable for NatWest not 
to change its mind at this point. It was entitled to decide for itself whether it considered the 
property suitable security for the mortgage. And, while Ms Ss original mortgage offer said she could port, or transfer, the mortgage to another property, it also said that doing so would 
be subject to NatWests criteria  which included a satisfactory valuation on the new 
property.
Ms S did want to go ahead with this purchase. So that meant redeeming her existing 
mortgage, and applying for lending elsewhere. She said she paid a very high ERC. NatWest 
has shown us that Ms S was notified of the ERC on her mortgage when she first took it out. 
And Ms S has also told us she was aware this was a term of her mortgage. So I dont think 
NatWest was wrong to charge this, as it had said it would.
And I dont think NatWest reached its decision on this property because of the fees involved 
in Ms S redeeming her mortgage. Its always been clear that it was happy to port Ms Ss 
mortgage, just not to this particular property.
I also think NatWest had been clear that the valuation fee Ms S paid for her new property 
wouldnt be refunded in these circumstances. So it didnt have to pay that back to Ms S.
Ms S also tried to get NatWest not to take her monthly mortgage payment, after shed paid 
to redeem her mortgage. I can see NatWest did take this payment, about a week after the 
mortgage redemption money was received. Our investigator has explained that this is quite 
common. And I think thats right. 
Direct debit requests are often done several days in advance, so can be difficult to cancel 
close to the time. And of course, leaving the direct debit in place does, as our investigator 
said, protect customers if theres any problem at all with the redemption. So I think NatWest 
erred on the side of caution when it left this direct debit in place. NatWest would also be 
aware that Ms S could obtain an immediate refund from her own bank, on any direct debit 
that was taken in error.
I can see NatWest then acted promptly to return this money to Ms S. She contacted 
NatWest on 4 January to say that the money had been taken, and I can see that the 
payment was already on its way back to her by then. So I think NatWest has done what I 
would expect to return this payment to Ms S quickly. 
I know Ms S will be disappointed, but I dont think this complaint should be upheld.My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 July 2022.
