The complaint
Mr V has raised concerns about the way National Westminster Bank Plc handled his 
complaint relating to a fraud investigation. Mr V complains that the compensation for his calls 
wasnt fair and that he wasnt called back as promised.
What happened
Mr V asked NatWest to raise a fraud claim on 19 August 2019. As a result of the claim, on 
27 August 2019 NatWest issued a refund of £66.67 to Mr Vs account. Mr V complained 
about the way his claim had been handled. NatWest responded on 3 September 2019 and 
paid Mr V £20 because it didnt make it clear that the refund wouldnt be applied on 19 
August 2019, when he first made the claim. NatWest also paid Mr V £8.10 to cover the cost 
of spending 90 minutes on the phone. 
Mr V remained unhappy with the call costs and contacted NatWest again. On 5 September 
2019 NatWest issued a further response to Mr Vs complaint but didnt agree to increase the 
award unless he provided evidence of his call costs. 
Mr V referred his complaint to our service and it was passed to an investigator. The 
investigator listened to calls Mr V had with NatWest and looked at all the available evidence. 
They thought NatWest had dealt with Mr Vs complaint fairly and didnt recommend it take 
any further action. Mr V asked to appeal so his complaint has been passed to me to make a 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see Mr V is upset at how his complaint was handled. Ive looked at all the available 
information but I havent been persuaded that the level of service provided was poor or that 
NatWest has treated Mr V unfairly. 
I know Mr V was expecting call backs from NatWest. But it had contacted him to advise a 
complaint investigation was underway. And NatWest responded to Mr Vs complaint on 3 
September 2019 which is within the time limits given in the rules. I appreciate Mr V wasnt 
called back as promised which led him to follow up on 30 August 2019 and 31 August 2019. 
But for me to award compensation Id have to be satisfied that the failure to call Mr V back 
led to a  financial loss or caused an unreasonable level of inconvenience. 
In this case, no loss occurred due to the delay in calling Mr V back. And whilst I can see Mr 
V chased NatWest up on 30 August 2019 and 31 August 2019, Im not persuaded that was 
unreasonably inconvenient. Ive listened to the calls available and NatWest said the 
complaint investigation was ongoing and that it would respond shortly. 
NatWest has sent across several recordings of calls it had with Mr V. Ive listened to them all 
and thought the calls were professionally handled and that the service provided was good. Im sorry to disappoint Mr V but I havent found grounds to increase the level of 
compensation NatWest has already paid. 
NatWest paid Mr V £8.20 to cover call costs. NatWest agreed to increase the level of award 
if Mr V provided evidence of his costs. Mr V says hes unable to do that because he uses 
pay as you go and doesnt receive itemised billing. I take Mr Vs point, but there are other 
ways to show he spent money on calls  like providing evidence of the phone credit 
purchased to make the calls. Im not persuaded NatWests request for further evidence of 
the costs Mr V incurred was unfair. 
Ive considered everything Mr V has told us in bringing this complaint. Ive also looked at all 
of the evidence NatWest has sent and listened to the calls provided. Having done so, I think 
NatWest dealt with Mr Vs complaint fairly. As a result, Im not telling it to do anything else. 
My final decision
My decision is that I don't uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 April 2020.
