K820x#14complaint
Mr W has complained that after his available balance was correctly  debited on his current 
account, several days later the available balance  was then reversed.  This allowed  him to 
effectively spend  money that had already been spent. 
He thinks Santander UK Plc shouldnt have allowed  this to happen, and that it should 
have contacted him to let him know hed been  left significantly  overdrawn.
background
Mr W has a current  account with Santander for which he has a debit card. All the following 
transactions are with the same  company  which Ill call T and were made using that card.
On 30 November 2017 Mr W paid £100,000,  and the following day he paid a further 
£100,000. Both transactions  were  authorised and the funds were set aside for T to claim so 
the available  balance showed as £200,000  less than there  actually was in the account. 
T claimed the second £100,000 transaction but didnt claim the first one. So Mr Ws account 
balance had the second £100,000 come off it, and the first £100,000 was still just showing  
as decreasing his available balance.  As T didnt claim the first payment the amount showed  
as available  again after four days.
Mr W paid a further £50,000 on 6 December, £27,205 on 8 December and £223,500 on 
11 December 2017. All these  transactions were authorised and the funds set aside ready for 
T to claim.
Unfortunately in error T claimed  an extra  £200,000,  and then also claimed the original 
£100,000 from 30 November. This left Mr W just over £270,000 overdrawn, without an 
agreed overdraft limit.
Mr W says he tried to use his card to pay for a work dinner and it was declined due to 
insufficient funds,  and the same happened  when he tried to use the card again just after 
Christmas. He went into a branch on 27 December to find out what  had happened.
Mr W complained  to Santander, and it rejected his complaint.  Santander said once a debit 
card payment had been authorised the merchant had up to six months  to claim the funds 
and Santander  couldnt refuse to pay the money. It said it was Mr Ws responsibility to 
ensure there were sufficient funds to meet  all his payments.
Mr W complained  to our service. Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr W was 
unhappy with the adjudicators view so its been  passed to me to decide.  Mr W has also 
complained about the service provided by the adjudicator and his manager, which is a 
separate matter  to this decision about the merits of Mr Ws complaint about  Santander.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I trust Mr W wont  take it as a discourtesy 
that Ive condensed his complaint  in the way that I have. Ours is an informal  dispute 
resolution service, and Ive concentrated on what I consider to be the crux of the complaint.
Ref: DRN12584372I dont doubt that this is very important for Mr W but although Ive read and considered the 
whole file Ill keep  my comments to what I think is relevant. If I dont comment on any specific  
point its not because Ive not considered  it but because I dont think I need  to comment  on it 
in order to reach the right outcome. This service  is impartial between, and independent  from, 
consumers and businesses. What this means  is that we dont represent either party,  and I 
dont act under eithers instructions or take directions on how a complaint will be looked at or 
what questions should be asked or answered.
I appreciate that Mr W would like a copy of his original application and the original  account  
terms and conditions. Santander has said it no longer holds these  as its so long since  Mr W 
opened the account, and in any event the terms and conditions have been  superseded 
many times since then. 
To reassure  Mr W, theres nothing sinister in Santander no longer  being able to provide that 
information and as has been  explained the original  terms and conditions are completely 
irrelevant to this situation. Banks amend account terms and conditions fairly regularly, and 
each time thats  done the previous version  is no longer relevant. If a customer isnt happy 
with any changes to the account  terms and conditions then they have  the right to close their 
account, but if they dont close their account  they are deemed to have accepted the revised  
terms and conditions going forward.
The terms and conditions  at the time of the transactions noted:
Without contacting us at all, you can also request an overdraft  by trying to make a 
payment from your current account, where that payment would cause  your current 
account to go overdrawn, or further  overdrawn,  without an Arranged Overdraft in place
You will automatically be treated  as requesting  an Unarranged Overdraft  if you do not 
have enough available money in your current account, or enough unused  Arranged 
Overdraft with us and you try to make a payment  from your current  account using your 
debit card or by cheque
Its not in dispute  that Mr W made all the payments to T (apart  from the £200,000  that Ive 
noted was taken in error  twice by T) and those  payments took Mr W to being just over 
£99,000 overdrawn on 15 December.  A payment in was received on 19 December which  
reduced the level of indebtedness,  and then T claimed the duplicated £200,000 in error 
which its noted was reversed a couple  of days later. 
I cant hold Santander  responsible for delays in requesting payment by merchants from 
whom Mr W does business  as Santander isnt the cause of the delay. I say this because 
when Mr W uses  his debit card, the merchant will ask Santander to confirm  that the funds 
are available to pay for the transaction. And after the payment has been authorised,  
Santander would be obliged to honour this payment. From  then on Santander will wait until it 
receives the claim for payment from the merchant. Santander cant say when the funds  will 
be debited from Mr Ws account and appear  on his statement.  This is because it isnt able to 
control how quickly this all happens, as its reliant on the merchant claiming the payment.
Ive listed below the transactions on Mr Ws account for the period in question. The dates  
noted are the dates  T actually claimed  the funds,  rather than being the dates Mr W spent the 
money with T and the funds were  authorised.  This shows how the overdraft balance  was run 
up, with the account initially going overdrawn on 15 December. Ive rounded the figures  to 
whole pounds for ease of reading.

Whilst its unfortunate T didnt claim the £100,000 spent by Mr W with it on 30 November 
until 15 December this was a payment Mr W had requested Santander make and that had 
been authorised.  So Santander simply couldnt  refuse to make  the payment therefore there 
was no option  but for the account to go overdrawn.
I can understand how confusing this was for Mr W as he thought he had more  money 
available to spend than he actually did, but that was not due to an error by Santander. Mr W 
has a standard  current account with Santander  which doesnt give him access to a 
designated personal banker, nor does  it mean  Santander needs to provide a bespoke  
service tailored specifically for him. Its Mr Ws responsibility to keep  track  of his own 
spending and notice that £100,000 hed spent  hadnt  left his account so he didnt spend  it 
again. Santander also had no responsibility to make contact with Mr W sooner when he went  
overdrawn because,  as far as Santander  was concerned, these were  all authorised  
transactions that Mr W would have  been  aware of.
Its unfortunate that T duplicated  a claim for £200,000 and I can only suggest Mr W takes 
any concerns he has about that up with T directly,  as well as any residual concerns about 
why it took T so long to claim the funds Mr T had spent with it on 30 November. I cant hold 
Santander liable for either of these as both were out of its control and were down to T.
I understand Mr Ws feelings of frustration  that he couldnt get an immediate answer in 
branch when he visited, but this was a complicated situation and related to transactions that, 
on the face of it, Mr W had requested and that had been authorised.  Its unfortunate that 
Ref: DRN12584374Santander couldnt give him a definitive  explanation sooner, but Im satisfied thats not 
enough to warrant  a payment of compensation, especially  as the underlying  issue  wasnt 
Santanders fault.
Santander doesnt provide a management  service  for this account and it is Mr Ws 
responsibility to manage his account.  I do understand that Mr W may find it causes  him 
difficulties in managing his account  when payments take longer than usual to debit it. 
However as Ive explained  above,  this isnt caused  by any error  on the part of Santander.
my final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.  My final decision concludes  this services consideration of the 
complaint, which  means well not be engaging  in any further consideration or discussion of 
the merits of it. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask 
Mr W to accept or reject my decision before 12 March 2019.
