Our adjudicator didnt  uphold Miss Gs complaint as he didnt think Miss G had been treated 
unfairly: There wasnt anything in the information  you provided or the information Sunny 
shouldve been  aware of, which meant it wouldve been proportionate to start verifying what 
you were saying.
Miss G disagreed but gave no specific reasons other than she was unhappy  with the 
adjudicators view. Through  her representative,  she asked for an ombudsmans  decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out reasonable checks  to understand whether Miss G 
could repay  her loans  in a sustainable  manner. 
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
Generally, we think its reasonable for a lenders checks to be less thorough  in terms of 
how much  information  it gathers and what it does to verify that information  in the early  
stages of a lending relationship. 
Ref: DRN53731232But we might think it needed to do more if, for example, the consumers income  was low or 
the amount lent was high. And the longer the lending relationship goes on, the greater the 
risk of it becoming unsustainable  and the borrower experiencing financial difficulty. So wed 
expect a lender  to be able to show that it hasnt continued to provide these loans to a 
customer irresponsibly. 
Sunny says it agreed to Miss Gs applications  after she provided details of her monthly 
income and expenditure. And this didnt suggest that Miss G wouldnt be able to make the 
repayments she was committing  to when she applied for each loan. Sunny has said that it 
carried out credit bureau checks. From Miss Gs personal credit  file its representative sent to 
us then I can see that Miss Gs mail order account  went into default in December 2017. 
I think that this entry  appears on her credit file a second time for the same account next to 
the name of a debt collector. So I think it was one default  not two.
This took place just before Miss G applied for Loan 2. So I think its likely that Sunnys credit  
results showed this. If it did then I would  have expected an additional check to have been 
done  for Sunny  to see if Miss G had any other outstanding short  term loans at this time in 
early 2018.  But checking her credit file I do not think that she did. So even if Sunny had 
carried out additional checks I do not think that its decision to lend likely  would  have been  
different. 
In these circumstances, I dont think Sunny needed  to take further steps to verify the 
information provided. 
Im only able to uphold a complaint where I can safely say that a lender has done  something 
wrong. And, in this case, I think that Sunny carried out the proportionate checks  I would have 
expected it to have done  when it provided  each  loan.
Im not upholding Miss Gs complaint. I appreciate this will be very disappointing for her. 
my final decision
My final decision is that Im not upholding Miss Gs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss G to accept 
or reject my decision before 23 September 2019.
