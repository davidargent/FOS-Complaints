Complaint
Mr G has complained about a number of loans he took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Mr G says he was lent to 
irresponsibly and the loans caused him financial problems.
To keep things simple Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
Background
We now know that Mr G took out 23 instalment loans from Sunny between September 2016 
and June 2017. Ive enclosed a summary of Mr Gs borrowing with Sunny, based on the 
information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this decision. 
One of our adjudicators recently re-looked into the complaint and said they thought it should 
be upheld from the point of loan number 4 onwards. Sunny made an offer to otherwise settle 
the complaint but this wasnt agreed to by Mr G. Ive been asked to make an ombudsmans 
final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice, on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking about Mr Gs 
complaint.
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure that Mr G could 
repay all the loans he was given in a sustainable manner. These checks ought to have taken 
into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being lent, the total repayment 
amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks 
might be reasonable and proportionate. However, certain factors might point to the fact that 
Sunny should have fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending was 
sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
DRN-1409347refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr G could sustainably repay the loans; not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Mr G could 
sustainably make the repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Mr G including assessing his income, expenditure and creditworthiness. It says that at the 
time all this information showed that he would be able to make the loan repayments he was 
committing to. Ive thought about this and also looked at the overall pattern of lending history 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that 
further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further loans to Mr G. 
Ive taken account of what Ive said above, about the length of the lending relationship, and 
applied it to the circumstances of loans 1  3 in this case. And I dont think its clear enough 
that what Sunny would have seen, from its checks, suggested loans 1  3 were either 
unaffordable for Mr G or that the information from the checks it carried out undermined the 
income or outgoings Mr G had himself declared. 
I accept that Mr G may have already been finding managing his money quite difficult at this 
point. However, theres no clear record that the type or depth of credit checks carried out at 
that time would have exposed these issues. So Im afraid I dont agree that Sunny knew its 
lending was unsustainable for loans 1 - 3. I therefore dont uphold this part of the complaint.
However, I think from the point of loan number 4, the situation was different and the types of 
checks Sunny ought to have carried out should have been much more comprehensive and 
searching. Thats because an obvious feature of this case is the rapid nature of the lending. 
Loan 4, for example, was Mr Gs fourth such loan in just 7 days and he was applying for this 
whilst all 3 others remained outstanding. So there was an obvious financial risk emerging 
and also signs that Mr G was having difficulties managing money. Had Sunny carried out 
more diligent financial checking, it would have also seen that as well as the Sunny loans, he 
was borrowing from another short-term lender at the same time. There was also evidence 
readily available that he had previously defaulted on other financial products. 
Our experience of short-term lending tells us that consumers who have difficulty managing 
their money in this way are less likely to be able to sustainably repay a loan. With this 
information, I dont think Sunny ought to have lent him the money for loan 4 onwards. I dont 
think it was responsible to do so.
In addition to the above, from the point of loan 10 onwards, there was an additional and clear 
pattern of repeated lending evident in my view. And there was an obvious dependency on 
high-interest, short-term lending evidenced by this, Mr Gs tenth loan in under 3 months. So Im also upholding Mr Gs complaint in respect of loans 6 -10 as Sunny repeatedly lent to 
Mr G in an unsustainable manner because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Gs indebtedness by allowing him
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use, over an extended time period;
and
the length of time over which Mr G borrowed was likely to have had negative
implications on his ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market
for these high-cost loans.
Putting things right
I order to put things right for Mr G, Sunny should:
refund all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 4 -23;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Gs credit file in relation to loans 4 -
9.
the number of loans taken from loan 10 onwards means any information recorded
about them is adverse. So all entries about loans 10 - 23 should be completely
removed from Mr Gs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. It must give Mr G 
a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
I partially uphold Mr Gs complaint and direct Elevate Credit International Limited to put 
things right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 July 2020
