The complaint
Mr R is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, blocked his account without notice
which meant that he couldnt make payments towards it, which in turn resulted in adverse
information being recorded on his credit file.
What happened
PayPal blocked Mr Rs PayPal without any prior notice. When Mr R contacted PayPal about
this, he was told that it was because his account had been linked to a much older account
that had a balance outstanding and that this balance would need to be paid before his
current PayPal account could be unblocked.
Mr R had no memory of an older account and he wasnt able to provide the information to
pass the account verification process so that PayPal could discuss the account with him.
This meant that PayPal couldnt give Mr R any information about the older account or what
the outstanding balance was for, which meant that the outstanding balance wasnt paid, and
Mr Rs current PayPal account remained blocked.
Contractual monthly payments became due on Mr Rs current PayPal account, but because
the account was blocked, Mr R was unable to pay these, and his account fell into arrears.
This resulted in PayPal recording adverse information on Mr Rs credit file. Mr R wasnt
happy about this, and he was also unhappy with the standard of service hed received from
PayPal while trying to resolve this account. So, he raised a complaint.
PayPal looked at Mr Rs complaint, but they noted that while the user functionality of Mr Rs
current PayPal account had been blocked, it had always been possible for Mr R to make
payments against the account, but that Mr R hadnt done so. PayPal also noted that theyd
sent Mr R standard notices that his payments were due or missed, and because of this, they
didnt feel that they had acted unfairly toward Mr R and they didnt uphold his complaint.
Mr R wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they also felt that Mr R had always had
the ability to make payments against the account, and so they also didnt uphold the
complaint.
Mr R remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued an initial provisional decision letter on this complaint on 6 July 2021. Following the 
consideration of additional information provided to me in response to my initial provisional 
decision letter, I issued a second provisional decision letter on 1 September 2021, as 
follows:
The spirit of my first provisional decision was that I didnt feel that it was fair that 
PayPal hadnt communicated with Mr R more clearly so as to prevent the situation 
that appeared to have taken place  that Mr Rs present PayPal account was 
suspended because of the status of a much older PayPal account owned by Mr R but 
which Mr R could no longer access due to having forgotten the login details over the 
passage of time.
However, PayPal have been able to present further information to this service which
demonstrates that Mr R did successfully log in to his older account on 17 February 
2020  the day the limitation was placed on his present PayPal account  and again 
on 20 March 2020.
This information includes confirmation of IP addresses and individual devices used to 
access the older account, which match the IP addresses and individual devices Mr R 
used to access his present PayPal account. So, Im satisfied that Mr R could and did 
access the older account when PayPal advised him of the outstanding balance still 
showing on that older account.
This new information leads me to consider this complaint in a different light. I say this
because this means that its no longer the case that PayPal suspended Mr Rs 
present account because of issues pertaining to Mr Rs older PayPal account which 
Mr R couldnt access to assess or rectify.
Instead, it appears that Mr R was able to access to his older account and so would 
have been aware of the status of that older account and the balance that was still 
showing as outstanding.
Furthermore, PayPal have also been able to provide details of when Mr R accessed 
his present PayPal account - including on 20 March 2020 from the same IP address 
and device as the older PayPal account was accessed from.
PayPal have confirmed that when accessing both of these accounts the information 
that Mr R would have been able to view  including payments due on those accounts 
 wouldnt have been restricted, and that when a PayPal account is limited, as both 
these accounts are, this only entails an inability to undertake various actions, such as 
sending or receiving payments, and doesnt limit the visibility of information present 
on that account.
PayPal have also provided details of contact information that demonstrates that Mr R 
had several conversations with PayPal collections agents regarding the missed 
payments due on his present PayPal account, including a conversation on 22 April 
2020 at which time Mr R made a partial arrears payment towards the account  so it 
appears likely that Mr R was being informed by PayPal of his continuing requirement 
to make monthly payments.
As such, taking all of this new information into account, it seems to me that its more 
likely than not, on balance, that when PayPal did inform Mr R that they had limited 
his present PayPal account because of a balance outstanding on an older account, 
that Mr R was able to access and review the information on that older account, 
including that there was a balance showing as still outstanding.
It also seems more likely than not, given this new information, that when Mr R 
accessed his present PayPal account, he remained able to see the payments due on 
that account, but elected not to make them.That is, of course, Mr Rs choice. But given these circumstances, I dont feel that I 
can fairly or reasonably censure PayPal for pursuing Mr R for the payments he failed 
to make on his present PayPal account, or for subsequently reporting adverse 
information to Mr Rs credit file regarding these missed payments.
All of which means that I now find it difficult to conclude that PayPal have acted 
unfairly or unreasonably here, and it follows from this that my updated provisional 
decision is that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing PayPal to take any 
further action at this time.
In my second provisional decision letter, I gave both Mr R and PayPal the opportunity to 
provide any comments or further information that they might wish me to consider before I 
moved to a final decision. PayPal confirmed that they were happy to accept the outcome of 
my second provisional decision letter. However, Mr R did make a detailed submission to this 
service highlighting areas of my second provisional decision letter which he felt hadnt been 
considered correctly.
Id like to thank Mr R for providing his detailed submission, and I hope he doesnt consider it 
a discourtesy that I wont be responding in similar detail here. Instead, Ill focus on the 
elements of Mr Rs submission that I consider to be most relevant in relation to my reaching 
what I feel is a fair outcome there.
This means that if Mr R notices that I havent responded to a specific point that he raised in 
his submission, it shouldnt be taken that I havent read and considered that point  I can 
confirm that I read and considered Mr Rs submission in full. Rather, it should be taken that I 
have read and considered that point, but that I dont feel that its necessary to address that 
point directly to arrive at a fair outcome here. 
Mr R has questioned the content of the information provided to this service by PayPal which 
influenced my writing a second provisional decision and which I stated demonstrate that Mr 
R accessed his old account having been informed that a balance remained outstanding on 
that account.
I can confirm that the information provided by PayPal includes IP addresses and that the 
same IP address is shown to have accessed both the new and old accounts on the same 
day. The information also includes device IDs which confirm that the same electronic device 
was used to access both accounts. Finally, the information also includes general 
geographical information which tallies with general location provided to us by Mr R when he 
raised his complaint with this service. 
Mr R has also stated that while he did attempt to locate and log in to his older account, he 
was unable to do so because he didnt have the information necessary to locate the older 
account. Mr R did note that he was able to request a password reset on some occasions and 
has questioned whether that might have been recorded as his accessing the account. 
However, PayPal have confirmed that the information that they provided to this service 
relates to instances of account log in, and that as such records instances where Mr R was 
able to log in to his older PayPal account.
However, I must note that the above considerations are for the most part secondary in 
relation to what I feel is that most salient point here  which is whether Mr R maintained the 
ability to make payments towards his PayPal Credit account while the restrictions on his 
overall account were in force. Mr R maintains that when he logged into his overall PayPal account, he couldnt make a 
payment towards his PayPal Credit account and as such couldnt meet the contractual 
payments required by that account. This ultimately resulted in adverse information being 
reported by PayPal to Mr Rs credit file, which Mr R feels is unfair.
PayPal maintain that the functionality of Mr Rs account remained such that he could make a 
payment to the PayPal Credit account. While there are no screenshots available from that 
time which confirm the position here, it seems to me that its more likely than not, on 
balance, that Mr R would have been able to make the continuing payments on his PayPal 
credit account, and I say this because it seems illogical to me that a PayPal would prevent a 
customer from making an outstanding due payment to it, even if PayPal were restricting that 
customers ability to make further transactions at that time.
It also must be noted that Mr R could have made the payments required on his PayPal credit 
account by other means, including by telephone, and PayPal have record of Mr R making a 
partial arrears payment of £7.94 to it on 22 April 2020. Mr R has stated that he isnt aware of 
making such a payment and has provided bank statements which demonstrate that no 
payment left that account on that date. However, this doesnt preclude the payment being 
made to PayPal from a different account, and PayPals records clearly record the payment 
as being made.
All of which means that it remains my position that I dont feel that PayPals actions here 
have caused Mr R to have been unable to make to necessary payments due on his PayPal 
credit account, and I do feel that Mr R was able to make the payments required on that 
account, either through his online PayPal account or via alternative payment means. 
It follows that my final decision here will be that I do not uphold this complaint. I realise that 
Mr R will be disappointed by this outcome, but I hope that he will understand, given the 
above, why I have made the final decision that I have. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2021.
