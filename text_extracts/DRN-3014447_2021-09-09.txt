The complaint
Mr A complains about problems making payments via PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA. 
What happened
At the beginning of September 2020, Mr A tried to make a payment from his PayPal account 
to a third party business. The funds were initially paid to the merchant. But a few days later 
the payment was recalled. PayPal says the payment was recalled because the direct debit 
instruction had been cancelled by Mr As bank. 
Mr A discussed the problems with PayPal and has told us the suggestion that he reregister 
his direct debit instruction didnt work. Mr A says that, despite going back to PayPal to ask 
for help nothing happened. 
Mr A referred his complaint to this service and it was passed to an investigator. They upheld 
Mr As complaint in part and recommended PayPal pay him £75 to reflect the poor service 
and delays experienced. Mr A has also confirmed that his PayPal account is now working 
again and he can make payments. 
PayPal didnt accept the investigators view and asked to appeal. As a result, Mr Js 
complaint has been passed to me to make a decision. 
  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr A has told us that a payment he wanted to make, which was in line with payments hed 
made before, wasnt successful so he contacted PayPal for help. But PayPal has explained 
that Mr As direct debit instruction was cancelled by his bank which is why the payment didnt 
go through. I appreciate Mr As concern, but I havent seen anything that shows PayPal 
made a mistake when processing his payment. I think its claim that the direct debit 
instruction in place had failed is most likely correct. 
When our investigator spoke with Mr A he input new details to the payment system which 
resolved the problem. So Mr A is now able to make payments from his PayPal account 
again. Im pleased the problem has been fixed. 
I need to decide how to fairly resolve this complaint. Our investigator asked PayPal to pay 
Mr A £75 to reflect poor service that impacted how long it took to resolve the issue. The 
investigator noted that PayPal didnt respond to Mr As complaint or provide reasonable 
support. PayPal says the investigators recommendation isnt fair but I disagree. In my view, 
the information available indicates PayPal missed opportunities to help Mr A at an earlier 
stage which meant the issue took longer to resolve. Im satisfied £75 fairly reflects the impact 
on Mr A so Im going to endorse the investigators settlement. 
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to pay 
Mr A £75.   
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 October 2021.
