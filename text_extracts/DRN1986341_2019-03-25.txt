K820x#14complaint
Mr R complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc that National Westminster  Bank  Plc 
irresponsibly approved  multiple loans while he was a student. 
background
Between November  2014 and July 2015 Mr R applied online for four loans from NatWest. At 
the time he applied, Mr R was an unemployed student and he said he had maxed out his 
student overdraft.
Mr R repaid each loan. But, in July 2018, he complained to NatWest that he didnt think it 
shouldve loaned him the money it did. He told it he didnt think  he had met the affordability 
requirements and that he had been  left in financial  difficulties. He also said that while he 
thought the checks it carried  out at the time were proportionate to the borrowing, he felt 
NatWest had loaned  money to him irresponsibly. He said he didnt have any income  other 
than student finance and also said the information  he gave NatWest about his income  and 
outgoings wasnt accurate. Mr R felt that because all the loans were  with NatWest it should  
have cross  referenced the information  he gave with what his current  account showed.
 
Mr R said as a result of taking out his loans he needed a crisis loan from his university to 
cover his general living costs. He also said he needed to borrow money from an arranged 
overdraft and family members. But NatWest  didnt think  it had lent irresponsibly. It said it had 
credit scored Mr R before approving his loan applications. And it also said it had relied on 
the information he gave it about  his income and outgoings.
Mr R wasnt satisfied with NatWests response and brought  his complaint to us. Our 
adjudicator looked into this and, while they empathised with Mr R, didnt  think NatWest had 
done anything  wrong. But Mr R disagreed, so his complaint has been  referred  to me for a 
final decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I understand Mr R feels  very strongly 
about the issues raised in this complaint. But taking everything he and NatWest have said 
into account I dont  think NatWest did anything wrong here. I recognise that Mr R will be 
disappointed with my conclusions so Ill explain why I dont uphold this complaint
The crux of Mr Rs complaint is that he thinks NatWest shouldve scrutinised his loan 
application and asked him to prove  the income  he claimed to have. He feels NatWest knew  
he was a full time student so it shouldve known he didnt have an income.  
NatWest said someones  status as a student wouldnt mean it would  decline  a loan 
application for that reason  alone. Instead,  NatWest  has explained it would consider a 
request for borrowing  from a student much  the same as it would any other customer. That is, 
itd take account of the relevant information provided by the customer  and see if the 
application passed its affordability  checks. 
Having seen Mr Rs bank  statements I can see that he was receiving regular credits to his 
account from his student  loan,  bursary payments and other bank accounts. NatWest was 
entitled to take these  into consideration  as a legitimate form of income. So, having taken the 
Ref: DRN19863412above into account Im not persuaded NatWest shouldve declined  Mr Rs loan applications 
for the reasons he suggests here.
Before approving Mr Rs loan applications, I think NatWest fairly assessed his ability to repay 
the credit  it decided to offer him. I say this because  it says Mr R scored  well on its internal 
scoring models and Ive seen evidence that NatWest carried  out appropriate affordability 
checks, which Mr R passed. So I think NatWest assessed Mr Rs applications as wed 
expect it to. 
NatWest credit scored each application Mr R made.  And Ive seen NatWests  lending notes 
for each  of Mr Rs loans, which confirm that his credit scores  were consistently good at the 
time of each  application.  It also declined four further  loan applications made by Mr R in 
December 2014,  which I think demonstrates that it was responsibly assessing affordability  
when Mr R asked to borrow  money. 
I think its likely these were declined because  the applications were  made  so close in time to 
the previous two loan applications. Mr R has also told our service  that he thought the checks  
NatWest carried out were proportionate at the time.  So, I think  NatWest  has shown that its 
acted fairly  here.
And when  Mr R applied  for his loans with NatWest theres no evidence he had adverse 
credit recorded. Mr R chose not to provide  our service with a copy  of his credit report. But he 
said that because  these were his first loans he thought his credit  report wouldve been  good 
at the time of his loan applications.  So, Im satisfied from whats been  said here that NatWest 
is unlikely to have  seen anything that shouldve deterred it from lending money to Mr R when 
it approved each application.
I understand that Mr R said he provided  misleading information on his loan applications 
about his income  and outgoings. Mr R told NatWest that he worked  in sales  on each loan 
application. I think it was reasonable  for NatWest  to expect him to provide accurate 
information. And I also think it was fair for it to rely on the information  Mr R had supplied  in 
good faith because,  having undertaken affordability assessments and credit scoring, it had 
no reason to doubt it. I understand from our adjudicator that Mr R has told our service that 
he thinks NatWest acted  fairly in accepting  the information he gave it in his applications. So, 
Im not persuaded it needed  to cross  reference or check this information elsewhere.
I recognise Mr R feels NatWest acted irresponsibly when  it approved  his loan applications. 
So, Ive considered whether it was irresponsible for the bank to have  loaned  him money in 
the circumstances. Irresponsible lending isnt just about whether  Mr R could afford to repay 
the credit  or not. Its also about  whether  theres  another reason he shouldnt have the credit.  
For example, it could be irresponsible to lend money to someone whos in a debt spiral. 
In Mr Rs case, he feels the reasons he gave for borrowing money shouldve stopped 
NatWest from lending  to him. But here, I can see that Mr R told NatWest  he needed the 
loans for a new vehicle,  other one off expenses  and to refinance  internal debt. I dont think  
these were unusual  reasons  for a customer in Mr Rs position to ask to borrow  money.  So, I 
dont agree that they shouldve triggered concern. 
Mr R also told us that, after the first two loans were approved, there were periods when he 
had to delay and change the repayment  dates because he couldnt  afford  the loans. And I 
can see that he used  part of his third loan to pay off loan one. So he thought  this shouldve 
been a further trigger  for NatWest to stop lending to him. 
Ref: DRN19863413But, while Ive given  careful consideration to what Mr R has said here,  I think  it would have 
been very difficult for NatWest to have known about Mr Rs personal circumstances unless 
he told it about them. It said it doesnt  have a record of Mr R telling it he was experiencing 
financial difficulties, which Mr R doesnt  dispute.  
Mr R was also able to repay each loan without  any significant issues and NatWest  told our 
service that his account management and conduct  was satisfactory. So, with this in mind, Im 
not persuaded that there were any reasons NatWest couldve been  aware  that Mr R was 
experiencing financial difficulties. That means I dont think it shouldve done anything  
differently. And, Im not persuaded  the loans were  unaffordable  to him or that NatWest 
irresponsibly lent to him.
Mr R has said he would  like his complaint to be resolved by NatWest refunding the interest  
that was applied to his account. But I dont think this would be fair here. Ive seen the terms 
of Mr Rs loan agreement, which outline  how interest  is applied. Its clear from this 
agreement that Mr R wouldve had to accept the terms and conditions before the loan was 
drawn down into his account. And, because I dont  think NatWest  lent to Mr R irresponsibly 
for the reasons Ive already set out Im satisfied  that NatWest was entitled to charge him the 
interest it did. It applied interest  in line with the terms and conditions  Ive seen. And I dont  
think it did anything wrong in doing so. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 April 2019.
