The complaint
Mr R complains that Link Financial Outsourcing Limited trading as Honours Student Loans 
(HSL) wouldnt allow him to defer payments. 
What happened
Mr R borrowed money on a student loan pre 1998  so it was a repayment-type loan. The 
original terms was 60 months with monthly payments of £156.10. In June 2022, the balance 
was  £5,722.30 and the arrears totalled £4,507.75. Various deferments had been agreed 
during the loan. But no deferral was agreed for the period between April 2019 and April 
2020; nor between April 2021 and January 2022. Arrears accrued during these periods.
HSL agreed a deferral of payments between April 2020 and April 2021; and then again for 
the period between January 2022 to January 2023.
Mr R complained. He said he had not been able to work for 20 years. He said hed sent in 
the evidence needed for a further deferral  he was on universal credit. His only income is 
around £1,000 each month  which is much less than the threshold for making payments. 
HSL hadnt accepted his evidence for the periods April 2019 to April 2020 and April 2021 to 
January 2022. He said the loan should be written off when he reached the age of 50 (we 
noted that will be in May 2024), but HSL now say that cant happen because of the arrears. 
Mr R says the arrears should be removed.
HSL said deferments had to be agreed based on a deferral application (DAF). It was down to 
Mr R to submit a DAF for each deferral period requested. Deferrals werent agreed for the 
two periods  20 April 2019 to 19 April 2020: and 21 April 2021 to 19 January 2022. The 
arrears for the first of those periods had been dealt with in HSLs final response dated 27 
January 2020. 
Looking at the second period, HSL said a new DAF had been sent to Mr R for completion in 
February 2021, and 3 September 2021 and 8 October 2021. But a completed DAF hadnt 
been received back. Several attempts had been made to contact Mr R in the interim. Mr R 
was written to on 14 October 2021 to say the DAF hadnt been completed, and a new form 
sent to him. No DAF was received and further forms were sent to him. Therefore  a deferral 
couldnt be agreed for April 2021 to January 2022.
Eventually, a DAF was received and approved in March 2022, and a deferral agreed on 19 
April 2022. The deferral was backdated three months  so the new deferral period was from 
20 January 2022 to 19 January 2023. HSL said Mr R would get a new DAF to complete in 
November 2022 to complete for the next period after that.
Mr R brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said the first complaint period had been 
dealt with in HSLs final response dated 27 January 2020. And as Mr R hadnt brought that 
complaint to us within six months of that date, it wasnt a complaint we could look at. Mr R 
didnt respond to our investigators view on that by the deadline in October 2022  so that 
was accepted.
On Mr Rs complaint about the period April 2021 to January 2022  our investigator said 
HSL acted reasonably. He couldnt see any evidence that a DAF had been submitted to HSL 
by Mr R. HSL had chased Mr R many times and sent him further copies of the DAF, so they 
couldnt do anymore. He didnt uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Mr R didnt agree and asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear from reading Mr Rs file with HSL that hes had a difficult time over a long period. 
He says he hasnt worked since 2000 and hes advised HSL of several severe illnesses 
since that time. 
HSLs processes and regulations do make for supporting customers such as Mr R  who are 
in difficulty. But equally, HSL  supported by the relevant government regulations  do have 
a process to follow when considering whether to agree to a deferral of payments. This 
includes the need for borrowers to ask for a deferral and the onus is on customers to make 
the application each time. And a deferral application form (DAF) is needed each time also. 
This is so the application can be properly assessed  to include income and outgoings. This 
is HSLs process  which we cant challenge. But it does seem reasonable to me that HSL 
would ask for a full application each time.
Mr Rs complaint about the first deferral period (April 2019 to April 2020) was dealt with in 
HSLs final response dated 27 January 2020  and as our investigator said, this was out of 
time as Mr R didnt bring that complaint to us within six months.
So  this decision deals with the second period of deferral. Mr R argues that he sent in 
evidence to support his application for April 2021 to April 2022. I saw there was an email 
from him dated September 2021. It included a screenshot of his universal credit payment of 
around £1,040 per month. But I couldnt see any evidence that a DAF was sent at that time. I 
can also see that HSL did contact Mr R many times at that time and after that. They emailed 
him on 7 October 2021 to say  Thank you for supplying your evidence for deferment. These 
documents will be sent to the Student Loans Company (SLC). Please be advised that you 
are also required to complete, sign and date a new deferment application form for each 12 
month period of deferment. HSL sent Mr R a new DAF to complete. So  HSL did set out 
what they needed at the time.
I can then see that HSL emailed, or wrote letters to Mr R on 22 October 2021, 11 November 
2021, 9 December 2021, 21 December 2021, 25 January 2022, and 9 February 2022. Each 
time they asked him to get in touch to progress his DAF. But I couldnt see any evidence he 
replied or got in touch until 21 February 2022  following which he submitted a DAF and 
evidence and a further deferral was agreed  but for the next period from January 2022 to 
January 2023. By then, it was too late to agree a deferral for April 2021 to January 2022. So, 
I consider that HSL did all they could to contact Mr R to get a DAF from him.
Therefore, looking at the arrears  I think they have been correctly marked by HSL, and I 
cant in all fairness say that they should be removed.
Mr R had also raised the possibility of the loan being written off when he is aged 50 (in 
2024). This will be a matter for HSL to consider nearer the time. But I will set out what  HSL 
have told us. Theyve quoted the cancellation criteria shown on the relevant government 
website. These refer to The Education (Student Loan) Regulations 1998 and say: The lender will cancel the borrowers liability to repay the loan if the borrower 
(a) dies.
(b) is not behind or any repayments under any agreement for a student loan and
(i) was under the age of 40 when this last agreement for a student loan was made and he 
reaches the age of 50 or when the last agreement for a student loan has been outstanding 
for not less than 25 years, whichever is the sooner, or
(ii) was aged 40 or older when his last agreement for a student loan was made and he 
reaches the age of 60, or
(c) if the borrower can show the lender that he gets a disability related benefit and because 
of his disability is permanently unfit for work.
HSL have said to Mr R that the loan cant be written off when he reaches the age of 50 - as 
he is in arrears  which is correct as shown above. But looking at the legislation, Mr R may 
wish to make an application under (c). But agreement to this will be entirely for HSL to 
decide and Mr R will need to submit the necessary evidence at that time. 
I also noted that the current deferral expires shortly  on 19 January 2023. So, I hope that Mr 
R is aware of that and has submitted the necessary DAF and supporting evidence  if he 
wants to ask for another deferral.
In summary, Im not upholding Mr Rs complaint- which I know he will find disappointing. 
HSL dont need to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 February 2023.
