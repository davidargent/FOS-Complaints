The complaint
Miss D complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Fluid irresponsibly gave her two credit cards 
she couldnt afford to repay. 
What happened
In July 2021, Miss D applied for a credit card with NewDay. She was given an initial credit 
limit of £1,200. The limit was increased twice so that by March 2022 it was £4,200. Miss D 
then applied for a second credit card with NewDay and was given a credit limit on that 
account of £1,200. 
Miss D complained to NewDay in October 2022 to say that the credit had been unaffordable 
to her from the outset and that appropriate affordability checks werent completed before 
lending to her. NewDay didnt agree it had acted unfairly when lending to her. 
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint be upheld. He didnt think that NewDay made a 
fair lending decision when opening the account in July 2021. He said that its checks ought to 
have revealed that Miss D had insufficient income to be able to sustainably afford 
repayments towards more credit. He said that NewDay should rework both credit cards to 
remove all interest, fees, charges and insurances that had been applied. 
NewDay didnt respond to our adjudicators assessment of the complaint, so it has been 
passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Prior to lending, NewDay were required to ensure the borrowing would be affordable to 
Miss D. There isnt a set list of checks it had to complete, but any checks it did needed to be 
proportionate in the circumstances. What is considered proportionate will vary with each 
lending decision and in deciding how thorough the checks needed to be, NewDay needed to 
take into account things such as (but not limited to): the credit limit, the size of any 
reasonable regular repayment if the full limit was utilised, the cost of credit and Miss Ds 
circumstances. 
As part of the application for the first card, Miss D declared an annual income of around 
£20,000. NewDay used credit reference agency data to check whether this was likely to be 
broadly accurate. NewDay also completed a credit check which showed that Miss D had 
around £26,000 in unsecured debt as well as a mortgage. There was no evidence of arrears 
or repayment difficulty on her existing debts. NewDay hasnt provided a detailed breakdown 
of what its credit check showed, down to individual account level. So, Ive relied on a more 
recent copy of Miss Ds credit report to establish what I think is likely to have been visible to 
NewDay when it did its check. 
I can see that Miss Ds mortgage was joint with her partner and the total monthly repayment 
was £708. Shes told us she was responsible for half of this, and I think this would have been 
a reasonable conclusion for NewDay to draw from the application and credit file data it 
received. NewDay could also see that Miss D was paying a further £381 per month towards 
a loan and a hire purchase agreement and that she held around £3,500 in existing credit 
card debt. In addition to this, Miss D was also regularly borrowing up to £2,000 on her 
overdraft facilities with at least two banks. 
When considering Miss Ds existing credit card debt and the new proposed credit card limit it 
was going to provide her with (taking into account in particular CONC 5.2A.27R and 
5.2A.28G), NewDay would have seen that Miss D would be repaying around £950 per month 
towards her unsecured credit commitments and mortgage. This figure doesnt include her 
overdraft borrowing, which she would have been expected to reduce over time as well. 
NewDay understood that Miss Ds monthly income was around £1,350. Therefore, she 
would have been left with around £400 to meet her other bills and essential expenditure, 
such as for food, clothing and travel, as well as repaying her overdraft borrowing. I think it 
ought to have been clear to NewDay that this would not have been sufficient to ensure she 
had enough disposable income to sustainably repay the credit to NewDay without potentially 
needing to borrow more. For this reason, I dont think it made a fair lending decision when it 
opened the credit card account in 2021. 
For the same reasons, I dont think it made a fair lending decision when it agreed to extend 
further credit to her, both on that first card and by opening a second account. I say this 
because it was clear from the credit checks NewDay did, that her financial circumstances 
hadnt significantly improved. As I dont think it made a fair lending decision it should 
therefore put things right. 
As I dont think Miss D should have been provided with any credit by NewDay, I think its fair 
that it refunds all interest, fees, charges and insurances that it applied to the borrowing. 
However, as Miss D has spent what she borrowed, I think its fair and reasonable that she 
repays the capital. Once the capital is repaid, NewDay should also remove any adverse 
information from her credit file that it may have recorded in relation to these accounts.    
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and direct NewDay Ltd trading as Fluid 
to:
Re-work both credit cards removing all interest, fees, charges and insurances not 
already refunded.
If the re-work results in Miss D having paid more than the amount of capital she 
borrowed, any overpayments should be refunded to her. NewDay should add 8% 
simple interest per year on those refunds from the date of each overpayment to the 
date of settlement. It should also remove any adverse information recorded on her 
credit file. 
Or, if the rework results in there still being a capital balance outstanding then 
NewDay should agree an affordable and sustainable repayment arrangement for the 
outstanding amount. When Miss D has repaid the capital NewDay should then 
remove any adverse information it has recorded on her credit file. 
If NewDay considers tax should be deducted from the interest element of my award it should 
provide Miss D with a certificate showing how much it has taken off, so that she can reclaim 
that amount, if she is eligible to do so.  Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 26 October 2023.
