Mr J says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly lent to him 
and provided him loans  that werent  affordable and led him into a debt spiral. 
background
Mr J took one running credit account and then 54 instalment  loans. A summary  of 
Mr Js borrowing,  based on the information  provided  to us by Sunny, can be found in the 
appendix at the end of the decision.
When Mr J initially  complained to Sunny, it responded  to say that it hadnt made an error by 
providing him with all of his loans. 
However, when Sunny  provided this service  with its submission it had reconsidered the 
complaint. It now felt that it made  an error when it had provided loans 13  55. Sunny also 
agreed to add 8% simple  interest and remove  these loans from Mr Js credit file. 
Our adjudicator thought Sunny had treated Mr J fairly when it provided him with the running 
credit facility. The adjudicator also reviewed  how the facility  was used, and he didnt  think  
there was anything to have alerted  Sunny to the fact that Mr J was unable to manage his 
repayments. 
During and after the time Mr J had the running  credit facility, Mr J was provided with a series  
of instalment loans  and the adjudicator didnt think any of these shouldve been provided.  
And by loan 6, the adjudicator thought  a pattern of lending  had developed  which  showed 
that Mr J was now reliant on these loans.  
It appears Mr J accepted our adjudicators findings.
Sunny didnt agree with the adjudicators  recommendation. It said the repayments Mr J was 
committed to making were small in comparison to his declared income. And based on its 
own checks, it believed  Mr J could  afford  the loans. It also reiterated the offer to uphold 
loans 13  55.  
The offer was put to Mr J, but he didnt accept  it. As no agreement could be reached, the 
case has been passed to me for a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  in order to reasonably 
conclude Mr J could repay the loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this 
Ref: DRN99821692in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  relationship,  I think  less thorough  checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Js complaint.
Mr J hasnt said he disagrees with our adjudicators opinion  about loan 1 (running credit 
facility) and Sunny stands by its offer for loans 13 - 55. Because of this, I dont think  there  is 
any ongoing disagreement about  these  loans. So, I wont be making  a finding about them. 
But these  loans were  part of the borrowing relationship Mr J had with Sunny, so I will still be 
taking these loans  into account when considering his borrowing history.
Our adjudicator upheld  Mr Js complaint from loan 2. By this point, Mr J had taken his first 
instalment loan while he was still repaying  his running account  facility. And our adjudicator 
thought Sunny ought to have realised that Mr J wouldnt be able to sustainably  make his 
repayments. 
Sunny says it enquired about  Mr Js income  and all expenses, including any short-term  
lending commitments, and it also used information  from Credit Reference Agencies (CRAs). 
And it was satisfied based on what it saw that Mr J would be able to be able to afford all of 
his loans.
But Sunny was required to establish  whether  Mr J could sustainably  repay  his loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  Mr J could 
sustainably make his repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
The first lending decision that Sunny made  was to provide Mr J with a running credit facility. I 
can see from Mr Js credit agreement that it explained that this type of credit was unsuitable 
for borrowing over long periods, and the credit agreement indicated that the repayments 
needed to be repaid  within five months.  I can also see Sunny allowed Mr J to make multiple 
drawdowns on the running  account facility  at the point loan 2 was approved Mr J had taken 
12 such drawdowns. 
Ref: DRN99821693While Mr J was still repaying the running  credit  facility (although he didnt take any further 
drawdowns after loan 2 was taken) Sunny allowed  him to take out an instalment loan. By 
allowing this loan, Sunny  had, in effect,  allowed Mr J to continue  to draw  down on the 
running credit facility in a way, that in my opinion was unsuitable. Indeed,  while Mr J was 
repaying the running credit facility Sunny allowed him to take out, in addition  to loan 2, loans 
3, 4 and 5. 
So, in these circumstances,  I dont think Sunny couldve reasonably believed that Mr J 
would've been able to repay loan 2 or any further loans without undue difficulty  or without the
need to borrow  again.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr J, to see if there was 
a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further  lending  was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. And I agree with our adjudicator that Sunny shouldve realised this at 
the time it provided  loan 6. I say this because:
by this stage, Mr J was into his seventh month  of owing Sunny money.  In my view, 
Mr Js loan history  up until this point was in itself a clear  demonstration of his inability 
to settle his loans over the life of the credit  agreement.
Mr J continued to be provided with new loans shortly after having repaid  previous 
ones for example loan 6 was taken  just days after repaying loans 3 and 5. And loan 6 
was his largest loan to date.  So Sunny ought  to have realised it was more likely than 
not Mr J was having to borrow  further  to cover the hole the repayment of his previous 
loans left in his finances and that Mr Js indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.  
Mr J wasnt  making  any real inroads  into what he owed Sunny and his indebtedness 
was being prolonged  for an extended period of time. Loan 55 was provided nearly 
four years  after Mr Js first. And although  it was for a smaller amount the some  
previous loans the sheer amount of time that Mr J spent indebted to Sunny meant 
that Mr J paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service a debt to Sunny  over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr J lost out when Sunny provided loan 6 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Js indebtedness by allowing  him
to take expensive credit over an extended  period of time and;
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Js
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost
loans
So, Im upholding  Mr Js complaint about  loans  2 - 55 and Sunny should put things right as 
detailed below.
Ref: DRN99821694Putting things  right  what  Sunny needs to do
Thinking about  what Sunny has already agreed to do, in order  to put things right it should:
refund  all interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 2 - 55;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 2 - 5 from Mr Js credit file
Remove loans 6 - 55 from Mr Js credit  file entirely, this is because the period of time 
Mr J owed Sunny money means that any information  still recorded about this loan is 
adverse. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr J a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that Im partly  upholding Mr Js complaint.
Elevate Credit International Limited should  put things right for Mr J as set out above.   
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 April 2020.
