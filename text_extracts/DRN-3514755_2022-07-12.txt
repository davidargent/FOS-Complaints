The complaint
Mrs B complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) unfairly declined her request for 
a credit card limit increase, and unfairly profited from refunds on purchases Mrs B made 
abroad using her NatWest credit card.
What happened
In 2022, Mrs B asked to increase her NatWest credit card account limit from £18,000 to 
£20,000, as she said she would be travelling and wanted to make use of its 0% foreign 
currency fee. But NatWest didnt agree to the increase, on responsible lending grounds. 
Mrs B complained to NatWest about this, and about refunds on purchases shed made 
abroad with her NatWest credit card  she said shed received back less than the original 
transaction.
NatWest said it wouldnt share how it determined acceptable affordability, as this was 
commercially sensitive information. And that refunds came from retailers whose timescales it 
couldnt control, and the difference in exchange rates over time meant refunds wouldnt 
always match the original amount debited by the retailer. 
Mrs B came to our Service. She said NatWests errors meant she was using over 25% of her 
available balance and this would affect her credit score. And that the refunds had left her £6 
out of pocket so far. Mrs B wanted NatWest to increase her credit limit, and to correct the 
refunds.  
After looking into things, our Investigator didnt think NatWest had made an error. She said it 
was entitled to make a commercial decision about whether to increase Mrs Bs credit limit. 
And that it hadnt profited from her refunds, as the difference between the original 
transactions and the refund amounts were due to exchange rate movements NatWest wasnt 
responsible for.
Mrs B asked for her complaint be considered by an Ombudsman. She thought NatWest 
should explain why it hadnt agreed her limit increase, and she provided evidence to show 
her credit score had decreased. She said someone was profiting from foreign exchange 
transactions, as shed received less back than shed paid, and the exchange rate was never 
in her favour. Mrs B said NatWest had a duty to treat her fairly by reimbursing her for the 
difference. 
As Mrs B asked, this complaint was passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im mindful that in making lending decisions, lenders take many factors into account as part 
of their lending criteria. This includes the consumers current situation and how theyve 
managed their finances, as well as the lenders own appetite for risk and wider economic 
conditions at a given time. Lenders are entitled to set their own lending criteria.
NatWest has shared with our Service why it didnt agree to the credit limit increase Mrs B 
asked for. How a lender reaches its lending decision is commercially sensitive information, 
so I wont set out this information. But, having reviewed the evidence NatWest has provided, 
Im satisfied it hasnt treated Mrs B unfairly or unreasonably. I note NatWest says that if 
Mrs B applies for an increase again in future, it will reassess her application in line with her 
circumstances and its lending criteria at that time. I think thats fair. Ultimately, its generally 
down to NatWest to decide who it lends to, and how much. 
I understand Mrs B might be concerned about her credit score. Credit scores are generated 
by credit reference agencies using algorithms based on lots of different factors about a 
consumers finances and how they manage them. Each credit reference agency has its own 
processes and algorithms for generating scores. Its important to say that the scores 
provided by credit reference agencies are only intended to give consumers an idea of how 
potential lenders might view their credit rating. Lenders dont see these scores. Instead, 
each lender has its own criteria and processes for making lending decisions. NatWest is 
simply required to accurately report information to credit reference agencies. Ive seen no 
evidence to suggest NatWest has reported inaccurate information about Mrs B which has led 
to her credit file being affected. 
I appreciate why Mrs B is unhappy that her refunds have been slightly less than the original 
transaction amounts. However, NatWest is neither the buyer or the seller here, but merely a 
payment facilitator. NatWest has explained that movements in the currency exchange rates 
between purchase and refund dates might have a negative effect on any refund amount 
Mrs B may receive on purchases made abroad, and I accept that as a reasonable 
explanation. Its unfortunate that, so far for Mrs B, the exchange rate between purchases 
and refunds has meant shes lost out. But Ive seen nothing to make me think this is an error 
on NatWests part or that it has kept any of Mrs Bs refunds. 
Mrs B says someone is profiting, but my role is to consider NatWests actions here, not 
those of any other business or person. And I dont think NatWest should fairly or reasonably 
be asked to cover the difference caused by exchange rate movement, as Mrs B suggests. 
Therefore, Im not asking NatWest to do anything further here, though I appreciate this will 
come as a disappointment to Mrs B.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 August 2022.
