Summary and background to the complaint
Mr A was the victim of an authorised push payment fraud when he was induced
by a supposed investment service to send a series of payments using the online payment 
account he holds with PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (Paypal). These transactions took 
place in April and May 2020 and amounted to around Â£11,000. 
Mr A went ahead with the so-called investments having been convinced that he was trading 
on the financial markets by an outfit that later came to light as operating a scam. For the 
purposes of this decision, Ill refer to this entity as P. As it turned out, P had convinced Mr A 
to send money from his PayPal account to a legitimate company, PureGold, as a ploy to 
ultimately steal his funds from there. In other words, Mr A sent a number of payments to a 
genuine firm that was unwittingly used to facilitate his money then being transferred onwards 
to accounts held with P elsewhere. 
Mr A complained to PayPal, citing that it ought to have done more to protect him. He also 
asked that he be refunded using the protection his PayPal account provides under the user 
agreement. PayPal didnt uphold the complaint because it disagreed  it said it couldnt 
reasonably be expected to have prevented the transactions from going ahead, and they 
were not eligible for a refund. Mr A therefore referred the complaint to our service.
One of our investigators considered what happened and didnt believe PayPal ought to have
intervened with the payments before they were let go, as well as acting in line with the 
contractual terms by declining to reimburse Mr A. Because Mr A doesnt agree with this
assessment, the matter has been escalated to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigators conclusion. Ill explain why. 
On account of the evidence, I am not persuaded that PayPal ought to have prevented Mr A 
from falling victim to this scam. The payments were not particularly unusual or out of 
character and so PayPal wouldnt have had reasonable grounds for questioning Mr A before 
proceeding with his payment requests. Whats more, all the communications material to the 
scam took place outside of PayPal and Mr A did not engage with agents of PayPal when 
instructing any of the transactions  so there wasnt a natural opportunity for PayPal to 
intervene, or have a conversation with Mr A about the purpose of the payments beforehand. 
After all, on each occasion Mr A authorised PayPal to send funds to a legitimate online 
commodities provider  and I cant see a compelling reason why PayPal ought to have seen 
through this and recognised this was in fact part of a scam orchestrated by a third party. 
Indeed, Mr A has said himself that this was a sophisticated affair; the persuasive techniques 
employed by P had him under the distinct impression that everything was above board. 
Besides that, delaying a payment requested by an account user, or declining to go ahead 
altogether, risks PayPal breaching the contractual agreement. Overall, I am not satisfied that 
PayPal should be expected to have taken further steps before these payments were let go.  
Finally, I turn to PayPals attempts to recover Mr As loss. According to PayPals Buyer 
Protection policy, these payments were ineligible for recovery. The terms make it clear that 
payments made in respect of gold, nor financial investments of any kind are covered by this 
scheme. I also havent seen anything that leads me to believe there were prospects of a 
return of Mr As payments from PureGold, as everything suggests this firm were simply used 
to send the payments onwards  so there would have been nothing left to recover from this 
intermediary. For the avoidance of any doubt, theres also no indication that PureGold had 
anything to do with the scam itself (beyond being used to facilitate the payment journey). 
I do empathise with Mr A suffering a financial loss here  this clearly was a cruel scam. 
However, I cannot safely conclude its fair or reasonable that PayPal be held liable. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, my final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 19 August 2022.
