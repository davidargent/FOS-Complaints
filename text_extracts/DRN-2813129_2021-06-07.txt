The complaint
Mr I says CarCashPoint Limited lent to him irresponsibly.  
What happened
Mr I borrowed £1,530 from CarCashPoint in July 2017. The loan had a 156-week term,
the weekly repayments were £38.06 and the total repayable was £5937.36. I understand 
there is an outstanding balance on the loan.
The loan was a log book loan. It was given on the basis that Mr I provided CarCashPoint 
with a bill of sale for his car. This meant that if Mr B didnt make his loan repayments, 
CarCashPoint could potentially recover its losses through the sale of the car.
Mr I says when he applied to CarCashPoint he already had a few payday loans to cover his 
spiralling debt. He recalls the agent advised him to change his application form and say that 
his second job was permanent, not temporary. 
The adjudicator recommended that Mr Is complaint should be upheld. He said 
CarCashPoint had not completed proportionate checks and had it done so it would have 
seen Mr I was having problems managing his money. So it was unlikely he would be able to 
sustainably repay this loan.
CarCashPoint disagreed saying its agents are remunerated equally whether or not a loan 
agreement completes, and would not tell a customer to lie. It said the variation in Mr Is main 
income declaration versus his payslips was not material, and with regards Mr Is second job 
why would it discriminate against people paid through an agency.
  
As no agreement was reached the complaint was passed to me to make a decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Our approach to unaffordable/irresponsible lending complaints is set out on our website and
Ive followed it here.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when CarCashPoint lent to Mr I. Its
rules and guidance, set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), obliged 
CarCashPoint to lend responsibly. Amongst other things, CarCashPoint was required to 
carry out a reasonable and proportionate assessment of whether Mr I could afford to repay 
what he owed in a sustainable manner. This is sometimes referred to as an affordability 
assessment or an affordability check.
The checks also had to be borrower-focused. So CarCashPoint had to think about whether
repaying the credit sustainably would cause any difficulties or adverse consequences for
Mr I. In other words, it wasnt enough for CarCashPoint to simply think about the likelihood of 
it getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr I.
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of each loan application.
In general, what makes up a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount, type and cost of credit they have applied
for. In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any repayments to credit from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet higher repayments from a particular level of income);
the longer the period of time a borrower will be indebted for (reflecting the fact
that the total cost of the credit is likely to be greater and the customer is required
to make repayments for an extended period).
There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed a proportionate check
shouldve been for a given application  including (but not limited to) any indications of
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in future circumstances. Ive kept all of
this in mind when thinking about whether CarCashPoint did what it needed to before 
agreeing to lend to Mr I, and have considered the following questions:
did CarCashPoint complete reasonable and proportionate checks when assessing
Mr Is loan application to satisfy itself that he would be able to repay the loan in a
sustainable way?
if not, what would reasonable and proportionate checks have shown?
did CarCashPoint make a fair lending decision?
did CarCashPoint act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
CarCashPoint asked for some information from Mr I before it approved the loan. It asked for 
details of his monthly income, expenditure and any existing credit commitments. It looked at 
three months of payslips to verify his income and copies of recent bank statements. From 
these checks combined it concluded the loan was affordable for Mr I.
I dont think these checks were proportionate for a number of reasons. CarCashPoint 
needed to satisfy itself Mr I could afford to repay the loan  without borrowing further or 
suffering any other adverse financial impact - for three years. He was using his car as 
security so there were very serious consequences for him if the loan wasnt sustainably 
affordable. And I think from what it learnt in its checks about his second job it should have 
carried out a fuller financial review before making its lending decision. 
I say this as it was a job he had only started towards the end of May 2017 and his weekly 
pay varied significantly (from just over £50 to just under £250). 
The parties are in dispute as to why the job status on Mr Is application was changed from 
temporary to permanent. I can see it was amended, but from the available evidence I cant 
know why. Mr I has told us the second job was a zero hours contract. The weekly income 
variance suggested that it wasnt fixed hours, so I dont think it was reasonable for 
CarCashPoint to consider this was a sustainable source of income given the term of the 
agreement. And without this additional income Mr I didnt have the disposable income to 
afford the loan: his main salary averaged £1095 per month and his declared expenditure was £1008. So the lender should have looked to understand this - and Mr Is wider financial 
situation - before progressing.
I have looked at Mr Is credit file to help me understand what better checks could have 
shown  Im not saying CarCashPoint had to do this but its one source of information that 
tells us more about Mr Is financial position and his creditworthiness at the time. I think there 
are clear indicators Mr I was having problems managing his money. The report shows he 
had defaulted on four accounts in the prior 12 months, two of which were in the previous six 
months. And as CarCashPoint knew, Mr I already had a significant level of outstanding debt 
that he was repaying at the time (£12,300). 
So given Mr Is second income wasnt certain and he was already struggling with his 
finances, I think CarCashPoint ought to have realised there was a high risk Mr I would be 
unable to sustainably repay this loan.
The lender asked why it would discriminate against people paid through an agency but that 
isnt the crux of the issue here  its the volatility in income and the lack of income history to 
allow the lender to make any fair assumption about Mr Is average weekly second income 
over a three-year period. I note the lenders point that there has been a good supply of the 
type of work Mr I did for his second job, but that does not change my conclusion  it was not 
a known or guaranteed fact at the time of this loan application. 
It follows I think Mr I has lost out because of what CarCashPoint did wrong.
Putting things right
I think its fair and reasonable for Mr I to repay the capital that he borrowed because he
had the benefit of that money. But he has paid interest and charges on a loan that shouldnt
have been provided to him. It seems he has already repaid in excess of the capital he
borrowed.
If CarCashPoint has sold the outstanding debt it should buy it back if it is able to do so and
then take the following steps. If CarCashPoint is not able to buy the debt back, then it should
liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined below.
It should:
Remove all interest, fees and charges from the loan and treat all the payments Mr I
made as payments towards the capital.
As reworking Mr Is loan account will, it seems, result in him having effectively made
payments above the original capital borrowed, then CarCashPoint should refund 
these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from 
the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse information recorded on Mr Is credit file in relation to the
loan.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to deduct tax from this interest. CarCashPoint 
should give Mr I a certificate showing how much tax its deducted, if he asks for one.  
My final decision
For the reasons set out above I am upholding Mr Is complaint. CarCashPoint Limited must 
out things right as set out above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr I to accept or reject my decision before 5 July 2021.
