DRN-3531181
The complaint
Mr S is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) took money from his 
savings account without his permission to partially offset an amount that was outstanding on 
his credit account.
What happened
Mr S noticed that NatWest had taken £500 from his savings account without his permission 
and used it to make a partial payment towards a balance that was outstanding on his credit 
account. Mr S wasnt happy about this, so he raised a complaint.
NatWest looked at Mr Ss complaint. They advised that theyd taken the money as per the 
Right of Set Off and had advised Mr S in writing in advance that theyd intended to do so. As 
such, NatWest didnt feel that theyd acted unfairly towards Mr S by taking the money from 
his savings account as they had.
Mr S wasnt satisfied with NatWests response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they didnt feel that NatWest had acted 
unfairly in how theyd managed the situation, and so they didnt uphold the complaint.
Mr S remained dissatisfied, so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can appreciate how Mr S might be upset to have discovered that NatWest had used money 
from his savings account without his express permission to partially repay a balance 
outstanding on his credit account. However, Im satisfied both that NatWests right to do so 
as per the Right of Set Off is permitted by the terms of Mr Ss NatWest accounts (as 
highlighted previously by our investigator), and also that NatWest did send a letter to Mr S in 
advance of their doing so that gave Mr S advance notice that money would be taken from his 
savings account.
Mr S has stated that he never received the letter that NatWest sent which gave him advance 
notice of their intention to apply the Right of Set Off. I can appreciate Mr Ss frustration in this 
regard, but Im satisfied that NatWest did send that letter, and that it was sent to Mr Ss 
correct address. 
Of course, this doesnt mean that Mr S received that letter, and I accept that he may not 
have done so. But this service wouldnt hold a business accountable for the non-delivery of a 
correctly addressed letter, and so I dont feel that NatWest should reasonably be instructed 
to reverse the transactions they made when applying the Right of Set Off as Mr S would like.
It also must be noted that businesses such as NatWest usually only apply the Right of Set 
Off when all reasonable attempts to arrange repayment of an outstanding balance with their 
customer have failed. In this instance I note that NatWest sent numerous letters and made 
numerous telephone calls to Mr S in their attempts to arrange a repayment plan on the 
outstanding balance with him  but that for whatever reason Mr S wasnt responsive to these 
attempts. Accordingly, Im satisfied that it was reasonable for NatWest to have applied the 
Right of Set Off in these circumstances.
Mr S has suggested that NatWest should have attempted to contact him via email as well as 
by telephone and written letter. However, I feel that it was reasonable for NatWest to have 
expected that the communication attempts that they made to Mr S by telephone and written 
letter should have elicited a response from Mr S, especially as Mr S hadnt indicated to 
NatWest that he couldnt or didnt want to receive communication from NatWest via phone or 
letter. Similarly, I dont feel that there was any requirement for NatWest to have attempted to 
have communicated with Mr S via any channels beyond those that they did.
Finally, Mr S has stated that he needs the money in his savings account as he has a relative 
who may need medical treatment. NatWest have explained to Mr S that if that is the case, 
and if Mr S can provide proof that the £500 is needed for such a reason, that they will 
consider returning the money to him. NatWests position here seems fair to me, and I 
encourage Mr S to liaise with NatWest via the channel already given to him by NatWest, 
should the need to do so arise. But I dont feel that NatWest should reasonably be asked to 
consider returning the £500 to Mr S until it can be demonstrated that the circumstances Mr S 
has described have occurred.
All of which means I find it very difficult to conclude that NatWest have acted unfairly towards 
Mr S in the manner which he contends here. And it follows from this that I wont be upholding 
this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any further action.
I realise this wont be the outcome Mr S was wanting, but I trust hell understand, given what 
Ive explained, why Ive made the final decision that I have.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 September 2022.
