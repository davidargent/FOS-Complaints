The complaint
Mr K complains that Barclays Bank UK PLC, trading as Barclaycard, has rejected the claims 
that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes being represented in his 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr K and his wife entered into an acquisition agreement to buy some timeshare holiday club 
points in February 2010. The purchase price of the points was £20,744 but, after a trade-in 
value was deducted, the balance payable was £14,749. Mr K used his Barclaycard credit 
card to pay £2,000 towards that amount and the balance was paid by other means.
Mr K and his wifes representative made claims to Barclaycard under sections 75 and 140A 
of the Consumer Credit Act in February 2018 that the timeshare had been mis-sold to them. 
Their representative said that theyd been unduly pressurised into buying the timeshare, it 
had been misrepresented to them and had been sold as an investment, and the commission 
paid hadnt been disclosed to them which made the relationship unfair. Barclaycard hadnt 
responded to those claims so Mr K complained to this service. 
Barclaycard then said that there hadnt been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by 
the timeshare company so Mr K didnt have a valid section 75 claim. It apologised that his 
claim hadnt been dealt with in a prompt and timely manner and it credited £25 to his 
account. Mr K wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. Barclaycard 
then said that there was no direct link between the debtor, the creditor and the supplier thats 
required for a valid claim under section 75.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld. She didnt think that 
Barclaycard acted unfairly when it said that it wasnt going to look into Mr Ks 
misrepresentation claim any further and she believed that it was unlikely that a court would 
conclude that the timeshare companys actions generated an unfair debtorcreditor 
relationship. 
Mr Ks representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. His representative said that a full substantive response would follow upon 
receipt of instructions from Mr K but no such response has been received. His representative 
says that the date of knowledge of the misrepresentation should be used and that Mr K is 
relying on section 32(1)(a-c) of the Limitation Act 1980. 
Another of our investigators then said that Mr K cleared his credit card balance in May 2010 
and that it wouldve been fair for Barclaycard to turn his claim down because it was raised 
too late. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr K referred his complaint to this service within six years of the event that he and 
his wife have complained about  which is Barclaycard turning down their claims 
under the Consumer Credit Act - but I need to consider whether it has acted fairly 
and whether the Limitation Act applies to his claims;
in this decision Im not determining the outcome of those claims as only a court would 
be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclaycards response to 
Mr Ks claims under sections 75 and 140A was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr K used his Barclaycard credit card to make a payment towards the cost of the 
timeshare and his claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented 
to him and his wife and that they wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been 
misrepresented to them;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclaycard would be expected 
to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time limits set out 
in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act 
and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Mr K could have made a claim to the timeshare company or 
Barclaycard about the misrepresentations that induced him and his wife into buying 
the timeshare when they entered into the acquisition agreement in February 2010 as 
that was when they say that they entered into an agreement based on the 
misrepresentations of the timeshare company and suffered a loss as Mr K used his 
Barclaycard credit card to pay for part of the cost of the timeshare;
I consider that their cause of action accrued at that time, so Mr K would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or Barclaycard 
 but he didnt make a claim against Barclaycard until February 2018, eight years 
later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mr Ks representative says that Mr K only became aware that he could make a claim 
to Barclaycard after he sought advice from it  but when he had the knowledge to 
bring a claim doesnt assist him for the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits 
for a claim under some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt 
have knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider 
that those sections are applicable to Mr Ks claim;I consider that Mr Ks section 75 claim is time-barred under the Limitation Act and I 
dont consider that theres any need for me to assess whether or not there was a 
debtor-creditor-supplier relationship in these circumstances;
Mr Ks representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr K and 
Barclaycard and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to 
require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit was repaid and the limitation period for a 
claim under section 140A is six years;
Mr K made the payment using his credit card in February 2010 but his credit card 
statement shows that he paid £2,000 to Barclaycard in April 2010 which reduced the 
balance on his account to zero  so I consider that at that time hed repaid the credit 
that had been provided to him for him to make a payment for the timeshare;
I consider that he would have needed to make a claim against Barclaycard within six 
years of April 2010  but a claim wasnt made to it until February 2018, nearly eight 
years later, which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Mr Ks representative says that Mr K is relying on section 32(1) of the Limitation Act 
which deals with actions based on fraud, deliberate concealment and mistake  that 
didnt form part of the complaint that was made to Barclaycard or to this service but I 
dont consider that section 32(1) would benefit Mr K in any event for the reasons set 
out below;
in some cases actions based on a fraud have longer limitation periods but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the timeshare company 
fraudulently misrepresented the timeshare to Mr K and his wife and I dont consider 
that it changes the limitation period that Ive described above  nor am I persuaded 
that Mr Ks action is based on a mistake;
section 32(1)(b) says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors right of action has been 
deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation doesnt begin until the 
debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with reasonable diligence have 
been discovered by them  and section 32(2) says that deliberate commission of a 
breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some time amounts to deliberate 
concealment of the facts involved in the breach;
Mr K and his representative have set out what they say happened before Mr K and 
his wife entered into the acquisition agreement in February 2010  but I dont 
consider that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a deliberate 
concealment of any relevant information (in fact many of the things that they say 
werent right would have been known to them at the time of the sale) so I dont 
consider that section 32 is applicable in these circumstances;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr K and his wife were 
unduly pressured into entering into the acquisition agreement in February 2010  
Mr K didnt complain to Barclaycard about that until February 2018  eight years later 
and I consider that it would be reasonable to expect him to have complained to 
Barclaycard about any such issues before then;
Mr Ks representative has said that Barclaycard should have told him about any 
commission that was paid to the timeshare company  but Mr K used his 
Barclaycard credit card to pay for part of the cost of the timeshare and Ive not 
been provided with any evidence to show that any commission was paid by 
Barclaycard to the timeshare company;I consider that Mr Ks section 140A claim is also time-barred under the Limitation Act;
Barclaycard responded to Mr Ks claims in September 2018 and didnt uphold his 
Consumer Credit Act claims but it apologised that his claim hadnt been dealt with in 
a prompt and timely manner and it credited £25 to his account;
its response didnt refer to the Limitation Act and I consider that it should have 
assessed whether that act applied to his claims under sections 75 and 140A, so I 
cant say that it acted fairly and reasonably in response to his claims  but I consider 
that it wouldnt have upheld the claims if it had properly considered them as it would 
have said that the claims werent made within the periods set out in the Limitation 
Act;
I consider that Barclaycards apology and the credit of £25 for not dealing with Mr Ks 
claim in a prompt and timely manner was a fair and reasonable response to those 
issues and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to 
take any other action about those issues; and 
I sympathise with Mr K and his wife for the issues that theyve had with their 
timeshare and the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair 
or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclaycard to refund to Mr K 
any of the money that he paid for the timeshare, to pay him any compensation or to 
take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 June 2022.
