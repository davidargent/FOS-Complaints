The complaint
Mr G, represented by his wife Mrs G, complained because he was unhappy with the amount 
of compensation which NewDay Ltd offered following his disputed transaction claim.
What happened
On 19 October 2020, Mr G contacted NewDay to say he didnt recognise a £17.97 debit to 
his credit card. NewDay credited the disputed amount to Mr Gs account while it 
investigated, and sent him a letter asking him to complete a declaration of fraud. Mr G didnt 
receive this, so NewDay re-sent the form to Mr G by email on 18 November. Mr G returned it 
on 21 November.
Mr G then realised that the disputed £17.97 transaction had been his genuine purchase, and 
not a fraud. So NewDay closed the fraud claim on 7 December, and re-debited the money 
from Mr Gs account. The balance on Mr Gs December statement showed a balance of 
£17.97 to pay. There was a minimum payment amount of £5 on this, but Mr G didnt pay it by 
the set date of 4 January, so NewDay debited a late payment fee and interest. It later 
reversed the fee and interest. 
Mr G rang NewDay on 15 January and was promised a call back, but this didnt happen. Mrs 
G has explained that they spent hours ringing NewDay, not just that day but on other 
occasions too.  They had to wait a long time on each call, and felt NewDay was ignoring 
them. 
On 28 January 2021, Mr G got through to NewDay. He explained that hed paid for the 
transaction by debit card, direct to the merchant, soon after hed received the NewDay 
credit. So he felt hed paid twice, as the money had been re-debited from his NewDay 
account. 
NewDay raised a dispute, and sent Mr G a declaration to complete and return within 14 
days. NewDay chased Mr G for the form on 12 February, but Mr G didnt return it. So 
NewDay wrote to Mr G on 2 March, saying that as it hadnt received the form, it would hold 
him liable for the £17.97 and all associated interest and charges. It closed the dispute.
Mr G complained. They hadnt returned the second form because theyd already completed 
one, and they were also unhappy about NewDays service.
In its final response to Mr Gs complaint, on 9 March, NewDay explained that the reason it 
had charged the late payment fee and interest had been because the December statement 
showed a balance of £17.97, and Mr G hadnt made the minimum payment by 4 January. 
But it reversed the late payment fee and interest on 28 January. 
NewDay also explained that as Mr G hadnt returned the dispute form which it had sent him 
in January, and chased on 12 February, it couldnt take his dispute further. But it apologised 
for Mr Gs 15 January call not having been returned, and paid him £30 compensation.
Mr G rang NewDay on 25 March, saying he wasnt happy with £30. NewDay offered him an 
extra £15, making £45 in all. Mr G didnt accept this and complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt uphold Mr Gs complaint. She said that NewDay had followed the right 
processes after Mr G had said the £17.97 transaction was fraudulent in October. And as Mr 
G hadnt sent back the form when he later raised a dispute about the same transaction, 
NewDay couldnt continue with it. For the failure to return a call and poor service, NewDay 
had re-credited the late payment fee and interest, and had paid £30, with an offer of a further 
£15. So she didnt consider NewDay need to anything more.
Mr G didnt agree: 
- He asked why NewDay couldnt have used the first declaration form for the January 
2021 dispute, which hed completed and returned in November 2020;
- He said he was complaining about how much time hed spent trying to sort this out, 
with little communication and help from NewDay. He said that it was very convenient 
that NewDay didnt have phone call recordings which would show how much time 
hed spent trying to sort it out. And he said some of NewDays staff had insufficient 
knowledge and preparation;
- The fraud declaration form had arrived by email on 18 November but it had given a 
date of 16 November for its return, which had already passed;
- Mr G said it wasnt the first time hed been treated shabbily by NewDay as it had 
twice before tried to get out of its obligations. Hed made the complaint to highlight 
this, and if NewDay got away with it, it would continue to treat customers the same 
way. 
He asked for an ombudsmans decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I recognise that Mr G has found this a very frustrating experience. Ive listened to the phone 
call from when Mr and Mrs G rang our service about the complaint, and its clear that they 
are very disappointed by NewDays service. Id also explain that our role is to look at the 
individual details of a complaint, and it isnt to fine businesses so they treat other customers 
better in future  thats the role of the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
Mr G would like more compensation than the £45 total which NewDay has offered. So Ive 
looked at what NewDay did in relation to the disputed transaction, and also the service it 
provided. 
For clarity, I need to set out that there are two separate matters which Mr G raised with 
NewDay.  Both relate to the same £17.97 transaction, but:
- one was a disputed transaction which Mr G raised in October 2020, when he 
believed he hadnt authorised it and someone else had done so fraudulently  in 
other words, it was a fraud claim;
- The other wasnt a fraud claim, but a dispute claim, about having paid twice. Mr G 
raised this in January 2021. This was after hed realised that the transaction was 
genuine after all. Mr G explained that after NewDay had issued the temporary credit, 
hed realised it was his own transaction, so hed paid for it separately by debit card. 
Then when NewDay re-debited it, it meant hed paid for it twice.  Having looked at NewDays actions about the fraud claim and the dispute claim, I find that 
NewDay followed the correct processes. Its standard to require a declaration / disclaimer 
form in these circumstances. I recognise that Mr G didnt receive the first form for the fraud 
claim, and hes unhappy that when the email replacement form was sent on 18 November, it 
had a reply-by date of 16 November, which had already passed. But he returned this form, 
and NewDay then went ahead with investigating. It gave Mr G a temporary credit while it 
investigated, and when Mr G told it that he had authorised the disputed transaction himself, it 
re-debited this and closed the claim. So this process was followed correctly.
I do understand that Mr G feels that, having completed the fraud declaration in November, 
he shouldnt have had to complete another one in January for the dispute claim that hed 
paid twice. But they were two quite different issues: fraud, and having paid twice. Theyd be 
looked at by different departments, and by people with different specialist knowledge. So I 
dont consider it was unreasonable for NewDay to have asked for two forms. 
I also dont think it was unreasonable for NewDay to have closed Mr Gs dispute claim, when 
the January 2021 form wasnt returned. It had asked for this in 14 days, and had sent a 
reminder on 12 February, before closing the claim on 2 March. 
So in terms of processes, I cant say that NewDay failed to do what it should have done.
Looking at the service NewDay provided, I recognise that Mr G would have liked this service 
to have had access to all the phone call recordings of his calls, so we could see exactly what 
they went through trying to sort this out with NewDay. But we dont always have all the 
evidence wed like, and when that happens I take my decision on what I think is more likely 
than not to have happened. 
Here, I dont doubt that Mr G had problems getting through to NewDay, or that it took nearly 
an hour to get through, on several occasions. And NewDay didnt return the call he made on 
15 January 2021.  I sympathise with this experience, but in late 2020 and early 2021, the 
Covid pandemic meant that many organisations were under pressure, meaning that waiting 
times were considerably longer than normal. 
Looking at what NewDay has so far done and offered, its 
- paid £30 compensation;
- refunded the £12 late payment fee, and the interest, charged when Mr G didnt make 
the minimum payment towards the £17.97 balance after his December 2020 
statement; and 
- offered a further £15.
Bearing in mind that NewDay didnt act incorrectly about the processes around the disputed 
transaction, I consider this total was fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of this 
complaint.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. NewDay has already made an offer to:
- refund the £12 late payment fee, and the interest, charged after his December 2020 
statement; and 
- offered a total of £45 compensation for poor service, of which it has already paid £30.
I endorse that as a fair and reasonable conclusion to Mr Gs case.  So my decision is that 
NewDay should pay Mr G the remaining £15 which it has not yet paid.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 July 2022.
