The complaint
Mr P complains about the issues that hes had with some replacement windows that he paid 
for using a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation Consumer Finance Limited.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr P signed a purchase agreement in March 2018 with a third party for it to supply 
some replacement windows at a cost of £3,926 and he paid a cash deposit of £393;
he also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Creation Consumer Finance to 
pay for the windows and he agreed to make 120 monthly payments of £64.31 to 
repay the loan;
there were some issues with the windows so Mr P complained to the supplier  it 
arranged for some remedial work but there was a delay in that work happening so it 
also paid him £100 compensation; 
Mr P wasnt satisfied with the suppliers response so complained to Creation 
Consumer Finance and then to this service  he says that he remains unsatisfied 
with the windows, he should receive more compensation and the interest should be 
reduced as he wouldve paid off the loan early if there hadnt been these issues;
our investigator said that the time taken to carry out the remedial work wasnt 
acceptable and he recommended that Creation Consumer Finance should pay £150 
to Mr P - but he didnt think that it would be reasonable to ask it to do any further 
remedial work and he said that it was Mr Ps decision not to pay off the loan sooner;
Creation Consumer Finance has agreed to pay £150 to Mr P but hes asked for his 
complaint to be considered by an ombudsman; 
its clear that there were some issues with the windows and the supplier arranged for 
some remedial work but there was a delay in that work taking place  that will have 
caused distress and inconvenience to Mr P;
the windows were repaired and Mr P accepted the repairs but he says that he 
remains unsatisfied with the quality of the work  Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the windows havent been repaired to an acceptable 
standard or arent of a satisfactory quality;
the supplier has stopped trading and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Creation Consumer Finance to arrange or pay for any 
further remedial work on the windows;
Mr P had agreed to make 120 monthly payments of £64.31 to repay the loan and it 
was his decision about paying-off the loan early - he chose not to do so because of 
the issues with the windows but Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable 
for me require Creation Consumer Finance to refund to Mr P any of the interest thats 
payable under the loan agreement;
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Creation Consumer Finance to pay £150 
to Mr P to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that he was caused by 
the delay in the remedial work; and
I sympathise with Mr P for the issues that hes had with the windows and understand 
the frustration and disappointment that he feels  but Im not persuaded that it would 
be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Creation Consumer 
Finance to pay any other compensation to Mr P or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
Putting things right
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Creation Consumer Finance to pay £150 to 
Mr P to compensate him for the distress and inconvenience that he was caused by the delay 
in the remedial work (which is in addition to the £100 compensation that he received from 
the supplier).
 My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Ps complaint in part and I order Creation Consumer Finance 
Limited to pay him £150.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 February 2021.
