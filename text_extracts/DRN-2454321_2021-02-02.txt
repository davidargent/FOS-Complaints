The complaint
Miss S complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) took back two credits of 
£17.22 it had previously reimbursed her for phone call costs, as it said the evidence shed 
provided wasnt sufficient.
What happened
Miss S contacted NatWest about some payments that had been taken from her bank 
account by her mobile phone provider. NatWest refunded charges of £17.22 on three 
separate occasions. But after reviewing the payments, NatWest said Miss S appeared to 
have used the same evidence each time. So it re-debited Miss S account, taking back two 
payments of £17.22. It said Miss S would need to provide an itemised phone bill setting out 
the charges for it to consider.
Miss S says she cant provide itemised bills, because her network provider doesnt offer this. 
She offered to arrange a conference call between herself, NatWest and the network 
provider, but NatWest said a conference call wasnt part of its process and advised that in 
future, shed need to provide an itemised phone bill showing the dates, times and costs of 
the calls for it to consider.
Miss S wasnt happy with this and complained. Our investigator didnt uphold the complaint. 
He acknowledged that Miss S network provider had sent a text message advising itemised 
bills werent available for her account, but didnt think Miss S had provided the evidence 
NatWest had asked for. He didnt think the conference call would achieve anything if the 
network provider couldnt provide evidence of call costs and explained that its not within this 
services remit to tell a business how to manage its complaint process.
Miss S disagreed with the investigator and said if NatWest had a problem with her evidence, 
it shouldnt have given her the money back in the first place and then taken it back. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
If a consumer has incurred costs as a result of something a business has done wrong, its 
reasonable to expect them to be reimbursed. NatWest may return money to a customers 
account in some situations where theres an issue with a payment. But often, businesses will 
want to see evidence of the loss before it reimburses any amount to a consumer  as the 
consumer would need to prove what their financial loss has been.
NatWest reimbursed £17.22 on three separate occasions using evidence that Miss S had 
provided. Once it discovered that the same evidence had been used three times to evidence 
call costs, it took two of the credits back and requested further evidence from Miss S.
Ive considered whether I think NatWest acted fairly and reasonably by re-debiting Miss S 
account and having done so, I think it did. I will explain why.
Its reasonable for NatWest to request evidence of the costs before reimbursing any amount 
to Miss S. This isnt uncommon  and the onus is on Miss S to provide proof of her financial 
loss. If the same evidence has been used three times, its clear that the cost of £17.22 was 
incurred on at least one of these occasions, but not all three. As a result, it means Miss S 
would have been reimbursed for two occasions in which she hasnt provided sufficient 
evidence  so its reasonable for NatWest to take these credits back until she does.
NatWest asked Miss S to obtain evidence by way of an itemised phone bill, showing the 
dates, times and costs of calls to the number. It declined Miss S offer of a conference call 
with the network provider and I dont think thats unreasonable. NatWest made it clear to 
Miss S what she needs to do to have the call costs reimbursed  and I dont think what it has 
asked of her is unfair. Its unfortunate if Miss S hasnt been able to obtain itemised bills from 
the network provider. But I dont think this means NatWest should explore other ways of 
obtaining this. So I dont consider theres any further action for NatWest to take.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 2 March 2021.
