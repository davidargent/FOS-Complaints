The complaint
Mr H complains about the actions of SumUp Payments Limited. He said it sent him a 
message suggesting that somebody had logged in to his SumUp account from Stroud, but 
he later discovered that may not have been true.
Mr H went on to complain that the gross incompetence and nonchalance of SumUps 
employees had wasted his time and energy. He told us that he suffers ongoing unease 
because he is still not satisfied that no fraudulent activity occurred on his account.
What happened
In January 2023, Mr H had a SumUp account which allowed him to take payments from 
plastic cards.
On 2 January 2023 SumUp sent Mr H a message with the title Did you log in with a new 
device?. The body of the message said:
Weve noticed that a new device was used to log into the account [details of Mr Hs 
account] with your Profile.
When: 1/2/23 9:38 am
Location: Stroud, GB [IP address]
Device type: Windows, Chrome
If this was you, you can ignore this email. However, if you dont recognise this device, 
we strongly recommend that you reset your SumUp password now [link to password 
reset].
If you ever have any concerns or notice something unusual about your SumUp 
Profile, please contact our support team [link to contact details].
Mr H was very concerned by this message, and immediately changed his password. Shortly 
afterwards, he complained to SumUp and explained that he was not in Stroud on 2 January 
2023, or indeed at any other time. Mr H was not satisfied with SumUps response to his 
complaint, and referred the matter to our service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint, but didnt uphold it. He thought the 
reference to Stroud might be because Mr H was using a virtual private network (VPN). He 
was satisfied that SumUp had looked into the matter and found no fraudulent activity, so 
Mr Hs account was not compromised. He also thought SumUp had investigated the matter 
quickly and sufficiently, then explained its findings to Mr H  so he didnt ask SumUp to do 
anything further.
Mr H did not accept our investigators findings. Briefly, he thought that both our investigator 
and SumUp had glossed over the issue. He said that SumUp did not investigate the matter 
quickly; on the contrary he waited at least two weeks for an outcome. It refused to let him 
speak to a manager, and provided factually incorrect information about his own logins, in 
that it said he only ever accessed his account from one device whereas in fact he has 
accessed it from both his phone and his laptop.
Mr H was also concerned about our investigators mention of a VPN, which he said was 
speculative. Mr H made clear that he doesnt believe anybody should speculate when 
dealing with fraud.
Overall, he considers that either somebody in Stroud logged into his account, or SumUp 
made an error in sending the notification  and in either case he should receive 
compensation.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr H is right to say that is possible somebody else attempted to log into his SumUp account 
on 2 January 2023. I think that is exceptionally unlikely, for reasons that I will go on to 
explain, but I cannot entirely exclude the possibility. However, even if an unknown third party 
did attempt to gain unauthorised access to Mr Hs SumUp account, Ive seen no evidence to 
suggest that SumUp was at fault. So I wouldnt award compensation in that case.
The login referred to in SumUps warning message happened at exactly the same time that 
Mr H logged on himself. Neither party has provided any evidence to suggest that anybody 
tried to make unauthorised changes to Mr Hs account. It therefore seems extremely unlikely 
that the attempt was made by a fraudster. It seems much more likely that the login attempt 
was made by Mr H himself. But that leaves the question of why SumUps message 
mentioned Stroud when Mr H was not in Stroud at the time.
SumUp and our investigator both raised the possibility that Mr H was using a VPN, which 
can disguise the location from which a computer is connecting to the internet. I know Mr H 
was not persuaded by that explanation, but I do think it is possible. Another possibility is that 
the reference to Stroud was simply a mistake. I am aware that IP geolocation  the mapping 
of a computers IP address to its real world geographic location  is not precise. IP 
geolocation is generally (but not always) accurate at country level, but it is often less 
accurate for towns/cities within countries.
I dont know whether SumUps message mentioned Stroud because of a VPN, an IP 
geolocation error, or for some other reason. But I am satisfied that I do not need to know that 
in order to reach a fair and reasonable outcome to this complaint, because I would not award 
compensation in either case.
Like many providers, SumUp sends messages to its customers when it detects anything 
unusual about a login. Those messages are a fraud prevention measure, but they are not 
guaranteed to detect fraud. Sometimes, as appears to have been the case here, there are 
false positives where SumUps systems detect something unusual even though the login 
attempt is genuinely from SumUps customer. But regardless of whether the reference to 
Stroud here was an error, all SumUps message did was alert Mr H to the possibility of fraud.
Mr H has suggested that if Stroud was not involved, then SumUp has made a mistake and 
he should be awarded compensation. I cannot be sure that SumUp did make a mistake, but 
even if it did I dont think it would be fair for me to award compensation. I say that because:
Mr H changed his password because of SumUps message, but it is sensible to do 
that on a regular basis anyway. I dont think the inconvenience of changing a password should automatically lead to a compensation payment.
Mr H was clearly distressed by the possibility that a third party had accessed his 
account. But at no stage was there any suggestion that Mr H had lost money. In 
addition, any use of a service like SumUps comes along with a risk of fraud, and 
there is nothing that either Mr H or SumUp can do to completely remove that risk. But 
they can take actions to reduce that risk  and one of the actions SumUp can take is 
to implement a system to send messages to customers whenever it detects unusual 
activity. I dont expect such systems to be perfect, and so I dont think it would be fair 
for me to make a financial award in the event of a false positive or a mistake over 
geographic location.
More generally, Mr H is clearly deeply unhappy with SumUps customer service, and with the 
speed and accuracy of its responses in relation to this issue. But I consider that SumUp did 
act appropriately. I do not criticise it for its speculation over the VPN issue; I consider that it 
was simply trying to explain what might have happened. In any event, Ive seen nothing to 
suggest that Mr H has suffered a financial loss as a result of the issues he complains about.
I also accept that Mr H is suffering ongoing distress because he cannot be certain that no 
fraudulent activity occurred on his account, and I am very sorry to hear that he has found this 
episode so difficult. However, my view is that overall SumUp treated him fairly, and so I 
make no award.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint about SumUp Payments Limited.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 November 2023.
