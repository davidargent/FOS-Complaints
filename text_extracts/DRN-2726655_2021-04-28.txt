The complaint
Mrs J, acting through her husband Mr J, has complained that she didnt set up a home 
assistance insurance policy with HomeServe Membership Limited (HomeServe) in 2016 but 
has been paying premiums since then.
In this decision Ill refer to Mrs J because shes the policy holder rather than Mr J who has 
brought the complaint on her behalf.
What happened
In 2016, Mrs J, through her daughter, set up a water supply account with Anglian Water. As 
part of that process it appears she was offered a policy with HomeServe to provide 
insurance for plumbing and drainage. In 2020, Mrs J queried with HomeServe why shed 
been paying every year since 2016 for plumbing and drainage insurance which she didnt 
need.
HomeServe explained to Mrs J that shed taken out the policy through Anglian Water over 
the phone on 6 August 2016 at an initial promotional premium of £1 a month. HomeServe  
says it sent her a welcome pack on 8 August 2016 which provided her with the details of the 
policy which included her right to cancel it within 28 days.
After the first year, the premium increased to £99 a year, and in 2020 increased to £266. Mrs 
J says she would never have agreed to this, and that she hadnt received any annual 
renewal information. HomeServe says it sent out renewal documents in July 2017 and each 
subsequent year showing what the new premium would be for the forthcoming policy year 
starting on the following 6 August. It also says that as Mrs J had been paying for this policy 
by monthly Direct Debit, regular payments to HomeServe would also have appeared on her 
bank statements.
HomeServe doesnt agree that its acted unfairly in continuing to provide cover for Mrs Js 
property. It says that unless it receives a request from its customer to cancel the insurance, 
or an instruction is received from the bank stating the Direct Debit has been cancelled, it will 
continue to renew the cover. Its records show that the policy was cancelled on 9 October 
2020 as requested by Mrs J.
 
Mrs J wasnt satisfied with HomeServes response to her complaint so she brought it to this 
service. Our investigators view was that the policy had been sold correctly and that 
HomeServe had sent out the documents correctly to Mrs J, so she didnt think HomeServe 
had done anything wrong.
Mrs J doesnt agree with our investigators view and has asked that it be referred to an 
ombudsman. Mrs Js complaint has therefore now been passed to me for a final decision 
from this service.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im not going to uphold Mrs Js complaint and Ill explain why not.
Ive looked at HomeServes records. These show that the policy was taken out in the name 
of Mrs J over the phone on 6 August 2016. Unfortunately a recording of that call is no longer 
available. Ive seen the letter that HomeServe sent to Mrs J on 8 August 2016. This was sent 
to the address appearing in HomeServes records. Following Mr Js complaint to 
HomeServe, its final response letter was also sent to this address. Mrs J has sent a copy of 
this letter to this service. Im therefore satisfied that HomeServe was using the correct 
address for Mrs J.
The letter of 8 August 2016 states the premium is £1.00 a month and covers the period 6 
August 2016 to 5 August 2017. It also shows that Mrs J agreed to pay by monthly Direct 
Debit, and her bank details (omitting some numbers for security) are shown. They show the 
sort code of the bank and the account number from which payments are to be made. It also 
gives information about how the policy can be cancelled.
In subsequent years, the renewal documents were sent out to the same address in July, in 
advance of the policy renewal date in August. These renewal documents showed the cover 
provided, the renewal premiums, and also the premium charged for the previous year for 
comparison purposes.
Im satisfied HomeServe gave sufficient notice to Mrs J of the policy having been taken out, 
its annual renewal, and the new premiums. Homeserve has provided evidence that renewal 
documents  which set out the new premium clearly  were sent to Mrs J in July each year. 
Mrs J says she didnt receive these documents but theres evidence they were sent.
Ive seen a copy of the renewal letter sent on 10 July 2017 relating to the forthcoming policy 
year 6 August 2017 to 5 August 2018. It shows the annual premium was increasing to £99, 
but the Direct Debit payment details have changed, as a different bank sort code and 
account number are given. When I asked our investigator to ask Mr J why the Direct Debit 
instructions had been changed, he said that the bank details were probably changed to Mr 
and Mrs Js joint account. He said these details would only have been changed with Anglian 
Water, not HomeServe.
My conclusion is that I dont consider that HomeServe has done anything wrong here. It sent 
correspondence about the policy to Mrs J at the correct address on a number of occasions. 
HomeServe isnt responsible for any failure by the postal service to deliver, and it would be 
very surprising if every year there was a failure with the postal delivery service. 
HomeServe did what it was required to do in notifying Mrs J of the upcoming renewal of the 
policy at the end of each year and of the new premium, so she had the opportunity to decide 
if she wanted to carry on with the policy. Her bank statements in 2016, and from 2017 the 
statements from her joint bank account, would also have shown the monthly payments being 
made to HomeServe. These should have alerted her to make enquiry of HomeServe or 
Anglian water as to what they were for, and she couldve cancelled the policy. The fact that 
she didnt do so until October 2020 isnt something for which HomeServe is responsible.
Im therefore not going to uphold Mrs Js complaint, and Im not going to require HomeServe 
to do anything.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive given above, Im not upholding Mrs Js complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs J to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2021.
