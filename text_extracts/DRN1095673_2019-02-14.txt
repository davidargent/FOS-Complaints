K822xcomplaint
Mr G has complained about a payment protection insurance (PPI) policy  he was sold by 
Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) alongside  a personal loan. 
background 
Mr G took out a personal loan (ending 1195) in January  1999.  The loan was for £4,000.  
Mr G also took out a PPI policy at the same time. The PPI would have covered Mr Gs loan 
repayments if he wasnt able to work. Mr G paid upfront for the policy and borrowed an 
additional £639.36 to pay for it. This is called  a single premium policy. 
Mr G complained to Barclays that the policy had been mis-sold to him. Barclays rejected  the 
complaint so Mr G brought his case to us to consider. 
Barclays then told us it was going to uphold  the complaint and was making an offer to Mr G 
for the mis-sale. It offered compensation of £1,094.18.
Mr G wasnt happy with the amount Barclays offered. One of our adjudicators  looked at the 
complaint and was satisfied that Mr G was being compensated as we would expect. Mr G 
didnt agree.
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Barclays has agreed that Mr Gs PPI policy was mis-sold, Im not looking at how the 
policy came  to be sold. Im only looking at whether the compensation Barclays  has offered is 
fair. Having  done  so I think Barclays has offered  fair compensation. Ill explain  why. 
If I find, or a business agrees that a PPI policy was mis-sold Id expect it to  as far as is 
possible  put the policy holder in the financial position they should be in but for the PPI. 
This would include  any premiums paid for the policy, any associated interest or costs, plus 
8% statutory interest for the time the policy holder has been out of pocket. 
So for Mr G, the PPI cost £639.36 of which he was  given a partial  refund of the cost of the 
policy of £264.95  (paid to his current account on 18 February 2000) because he refinanced  
the loan early. This leaves a refund due to him of £374.41. Added  to this is a refund of the 
interest of £88.49  plus 8% simple interest  totalling £410.12. Income  tax of £82.02 at a rate of 
20% has been deducted giving a total refund of £791.00. 
In this case, Barclays told us it had already  upheld another  second loan (ending number 
3433) which had refinanced the first loan. It had paid Mr G £4,731.66 in compensation in 
July 2018. And that had been accepted  by Mr G. 
Because of the way single  premium  policies work,  when Mr G refinanced  his first loan with 
the second loan, he would  have  received  a partial  refund  of the cost of the PPI attached to 
the first loan. But as it was only a partial  refund this means a part of the cost of the PPI for 
Ref: DRN10956732the first loan would have  been passed to the second loan. So Mr G would have paid more for 
this when he took out the second  loan. 
To recognise  that, Barclays,  in its offer for the first loan, has added an additional  £43.89 
because of the overpayments made on the second loan for the PPI from the first loan. And it 
has added  a further £324.10 in 8% statutory interest (less £64.81 of income tax at 20%) 
because Mr G had been out of pocket  all of that time. 
In total, in compensating for the first loan (1195) Barclays  added  another  £303.18 to the 
amount of £791.00  because of the costs that had passed to the second loan. So £1,094.18 
in total which  is the amount Barclays has offered. 
The 8% simple interest is added to any premiums Mr G paid to reflect that he has been out 
of pocket of that money. So Barclays has calculated how much Mr G paid for the PPI each 
month and refunded that amount plus 8% simple  interest on each monthly over-payment,  
from when Mr G paid the premium up until the compensation is paid. 
Redress for the first loan is lower  than Barclays paid Mr G for the second  loan. But this is a 
reflection of the lower amount borrowed in 1999,  £4,000 compared to the £12,000 borrowed 
in 2000. The PPI borrowing would have been  higher on the second loan as well, £3,431.57 
compared to the £639.36  on the first loan. So it follows that the compensation for the mis-
sale on the first loan will be a lot lower. 
Taking all of the above into account, I am satisfied that Barclays has calculated the 
compensation for the personal loan (1195) fairly, and as I would expect. 
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, I uphold Mr Gs complaint. But Barclays  Bank UK PLC has 
correctly offered compensation to Mr G and I wont be asking it to do anything more.  It is for 
Mr G to accept  the offer,  if he hasnt already done so. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 March  2019.
