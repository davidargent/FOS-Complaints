The complaint
Ms L complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that shes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. 
Shes being represented in her complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Ms L says that she used a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay 
for a timeshare that she bought in 2009. She says that she became aware in November 
2019 that she had cause to make a claim to Barclays Partner Finance under the Consumer 
Credit Act and she made a claim to it in February 2020. Barclays Partner Finance says that it 
investigated the claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act but concluded that it had 
been brought too late. It said that Ms L didnt bring her claim within the time period set out in 
the Limitation Act 1980 so it didnt need to look into the claim any further. 
Ms L then complained to this service that the timeshare was misrepresented to Ms L and 
that she was pressured into purchasing a product which was unsuitable and failed to provide 
the advantages promised. Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be 
upheld. She said that Ms Ls claim was more than likely time barred under the Limitation Act 
so she thought that Barclays Partner Finances decision not to look into her claim was fair.
Ms Ls representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has provided Ms Ls responses to a set of questions that it has asked her 
about the loan. It says, in summary, that:
theres no statutory time limit on raising a complaint under the Consumer Credit Act 
or for asking this service to look into a refusal by a creditor to properly investigate a 
complaint and the time limit of six years applies to the raising of a court action;
the timeshare company went into liquidation in May 2020 so is unable to provide the 
product to Ms L and the date of knowledge for making a section 75 claim about that 
breach of contract, and the limitation period for doing so, can only logically run from 
the date the company entered into liquidation;
the timeshare company marketed and sold the timeshare as an investment in breach 
of the Timeshare Regulations which was deliberately concealed from Ms L and 
section 32 of the Limitation Act postpones the period of limitation until the 
concealment has been discovered or could with reasonable diligence have been 
discovered  and Ms L couldnt have reasonably become aware of it until after she 
received advice from it May 2019;
Ms L only discovered the actual characteristics of the product many years after she 
purchased it  its a long term contract with unlimited liability for management 
charges which was concealed at the point of purchase and is unduly onerous;
theres an unfair creditor-debtor relationship under section 140A of the Consumer 
Credit Act as the existence and the amount of commission paid by Barclays Partner 
Finance to the timeshare company (or the broker) for the introduction for the loan 
agreement were concealed from Ms L at the point of sale and she could only have 
become aware of the non-disclosure after she sought advice from it in May 2019;
the loan has all the hallmarks of an unaffordable loan given the interest rate and that 
no affordability assessment was made before the loan was made to Ms L; and
the date that Ms L sought advice is the date of knowledge for the purposes of the six-
year limitation period.
It also says that it has now made a claim to Barclays Partner Finance under section 75 about 
the timeshare companys breach of contract. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that she 
had cause for complaint;
Ms Ls complaint is that Barclays Partner Finance turned down her claims under the 
Limitation Act and her representative says that theres no statutory time limit on 
raising a complaint under the Consumer Credit Act and the time limit of six years 
applies to the raising of a court action;
I accept that Ms L has referred her complaint to this service within six years of the 
event that shes complained about  the turning down of her claims under the 
Consumer Credit Act - but I need to consider whether Barclays Partner Finance has 
acted fairly in saying that the Limitation Act applies to her claims;
I consider that the Limitation Act does apply to claims under the Consumer Credit Act 
and that its fair and reasonable for Barclays Partner Finance to apply the Limitation 
Act when considering Ms Ls claims;
Ms Ls claims to Barclays Partner Finance are under sections 75 and 140A of the 
Consumer Credit Act  in this decision Im not determining the outcome of those 
claims as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Barclays Partner Finances response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Ms Ls claim under section 75 is that the timeshare was misrepresented to her and 
that she wouldnt have bought it if it hadnt been misrepresented to her (a claim has 
now been made that theres also been a breach of contract by the timeshare 
company  but that claim is being dealt with separately and is not dealt with in this 
decision);
in making a claim under the Consumer Credit Act, Ms L is seeking a legal remedy so 
if Barclays Partner Finance turned down her initial claim, she would be able to ask a 
court to consider it or ask our service to assess if Barclays Partner Finance had acted fairly - but that means that Barclays Partner Finance is able to consider any 
legal defence that it may have to her claim, whether or not Ms L subsequently 
decided to take her claim to court - so although the Consumer Credit Act doesnt 
contain any explicit time limits within the body of the legislation, Im satisfied that the 
Limitation Act does apply in the way it does to all legal claims;
if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Barclays Partner Finance would 
be expected to consider that claim - unless the claim was brought outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the 
Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred); 
I consider that Ms L could have made a claim to the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that induced her into buying the 
timeshare when she entered into the agreement to buy the timeshare  which it says 
was in October 2009  as that was when she entered into an agreement based on 
the misrepresentations of the timeshare company and suffered a loss as she entered 
into the loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the timeshare;
I consider that her cause of action accrued at that time, so she would have had six 
years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or Barclays 
Partner Finance  but she didnt make a claim against Barclays Partner Finance until 
February 2020, which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;
Ms Ls representative says that Ms L only became aware that she could make a 
claim to Barclays Partner Finance after she sought advice from it in May 2019 - but 
when she had the knowledge to bring a claim doesnt assist her for the purposes of 
the Limitation Act - section 14A of that Act extends the time in some circumstances 
where a claimant doesnt have knowledge at the time when the cause of action 
accrued, but that is only for claims brought in negligence and I cant see that Ms L 
would have such a claim against Barclays Partner Finance;
Barclays Partner Finance says that it investigated Ms Ls claim under section 75 but 
concluded that it hadnt been brought within the time limits set out in the Limitation 
Act - I consider that to have been a fair and reasonable response to Ms Ls claim 
under section 75 and I dont consider that it was required to do more in response to 
that claim;
Ms Ls representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Ms L and 
Barclays Partner Finance - section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other 
things, to require a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit 
agreement if it determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and 
the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that Ms L entered into the loan agreement in October 
2009 and it ended in November 2012 - so Ms L would have needed to make a claim 
against Barclays Partner Finance within six years of November 2012  but she didnt 
make a claim to it until February 2020, more than seven years later, which was 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act;I consider that Barclays Partner Finance should have assessed Ms Ls claim under 
section 140A but Ive seen no evidence to show that it did that  so I cant say that it 
acted fairly in response to Ms Ls claim, but I consider that it wouldnt have upheld 
the claim if it had properly considered it as it would have said that the claim wasnt 
made within the period set out in the Limitation Act;
Ms Ls representative says that information about the credit agreement and 
timeshare was deliberately concealed from Ms L and that she didnt discover the 
concealment until after shed sought advice from it in May 2019;
section 32(1)(b) of the Limitation Act says that, if any fact relevant to the debtors 
right of action has been deliberately concealed from them, the period of limitation 
doesnt begin until the debtor has discovered the concealment or it could with 
reasonable diligence have been discovered by them - and section 32(2) states that 
deliberate commission of a breach of duty which is unlikely to be discovered for some 
time amounts to deliberate concealment of the facts involved in that breach;
Ms L and her representative have set out what they say happened before Ms L 
entered into the credit agreement in October 2009  but I dont consider that theres 
enough evidence to show that theres been a deliberate concealment of any relevant 
information, in fact many of the things that they say werent right would have been 
known to Ms L at the time of the sale, such as the length of the contract and the 
interest rate of the loan  so I dont consider that section 32 is applicable in these 
circumstances;
Ms Ls representative has said that Barclays Partner Finance should have told her 
about any commission it paid to the timeshare company for arranging the loan - but 
Ms L complained that shed been pressured into taking out the timeshare and that 
there was a misrepresentation about the product and its benefits - I cant see that any 
complaint has been made to Barclays Partner Finance about any commission it paid 
to the provider so even if I were to find that the period of limitation was extended for 
that reason, I dont think it would assist Ms L in her complaint about pressure and 
misrepresentation as I think the time limit to bring a claim about that had already 
passed;
Ms Ls representative has said, in response to our investigators recommendations, 
that the loan may have been unaffordable for Ms L and that no affordability 
assessment was made before the loan was made to Ms L;
that complaint wasnt included in the claim that Ms L made to Barclays Partner 
Finance or the complaint that she made to this service, Ive seen no evidence to  
show that the loan was unaffordable for Ms L, and  as the loan was made in 
October 2009  I consider it to be more likely than not that any complaint about the 
affordability of the loan would now be time barred;
I sympathise with Ms L for the issues that shed had with her timeshare and the 
difficulties that shes described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in 
these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to her any 
of the money that she paid under the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation 
or to take any other action in response to her complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms L to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 September 2021.
