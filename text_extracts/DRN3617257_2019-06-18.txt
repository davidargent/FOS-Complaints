K820x#14complaint
Miss B complains  that Bank  of Scotland plc trading as Birmingham Midshires (BM) took 
possession of her mortgaged property unnecessarily and then sold it at an undervalue.
background
Miss B and her partner had a property  mortgaged to BM. They separated  and she moved  
out. The mortgage fell into arrears and in 2011  BM took possession of the property  and sold 
it for £68,000 leaving a shortfall of about  £48,000.  Miss B says the property  was actually 
worth about  £98,000  so was undervalued, and that taking possession was unnecessary.
On Miss Bs complaint to BM it said that after obtaining possession  it had obtained  two 
valuations from surveyors and local estate  agents.  Both gave a market  value of £65,000. BM 
said it had acted reasonably in selling  the property for £68,000, the price  being £3,000 more 
than the market value.
Miss B had told BM that she put the property on the market  in March 2011  at her preferred 
asking price of £98,000. In June 2011 shed reported that there  had been  no interest. So the 
property had been on the market for about three  months  without attracting any potential 
buyers.
Miss B wasnt happy with this and brought her complaint to this service. She said that in 
August 2010 shed  issued  court proceedings against her former partner to force  a sale of the 
property. The court had made an order on 8 March 2011 that it be sold,  and on 10 March it 
was placed with selling agents at an asking price of £98,000. BM had nevertheless issued 
proceedings for possession.
If the property had been sold for its market value  of about £98,000 the shortfall would  have 
been more realistic to come to an agreement on. She never had any communication or help 
from BM. If it had listened and co operated it would have understood there  was no benefit  in 
taking possession.
Our adjudicator didnt  recommend that Miss Bs complaint be upheld.  She said BM had 
accepted an offer of £68,000 which was above the valuation amount. It was entitled to rely 
on the surveyors valuations it had obtained. When the property was put on the market  at the 
higher price  there  was no interest.
Miss B didnt agree and asked  for an ombudsman to look at the case. She still believed  that 
BM under-sold the property. While surveyors did value the property at £65,000 and it sold at 
£68,000, another competitive high street estate agent only a month  prior had valued  it at 
£98,000. 
She said shed emailed her former partner saying the agents had told her of interest in the 
property at about £89,000.  Also that they had advised her that the market was picking up 
and they were confident they could  obtain  a higher price. So it wasnt  true that there  was no 
interest in the property.  This also proved that an amount a lot higher than £65,000 could 
have been achieved.
Ref: DRN36172572my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I think there are two issues here, conveniently identified in Miss Bs email of 1 April 2019:
did BM take possession of Miss Bs property unnecessarily?
did BM sell the property at an undervalue?
On the first issue, I note that Miss B wasnt living in the property. Her former partner was or 
had been living there, but Ive no information  about  the circumstances of his eviction, if any.
BM wrote  to Miss Bs solicitors on 25 August 2010  saying that a payment had recently been 
received and an arrangement to discharge  the remaining  arrears  gradually had been agreed.  
Miss Bs email  to BM of 8 September 2010 suggests  this was made between BM and the 
former partner. 
However BMs letter of 1 September 2010  to Miss B and her former partner indicates  that a 
payment arrangement had been made in respect  of the arrears but this hadnt been  kept to. 
And only three of the last six contractual monthly  payments had been  made.
At the time BM took possession the arrears were  approaching £2,000  and BM was already 
facing a loss. As far as I can see, no monthly payments were being received  from Miss B or 
her former partner.
Miss B had obtained  a court order against  her former partner for the property to be sold and 
had instructed estate  agents to offer it for sale. However the asking price was £98,000, and 
the property had been on the market for some three months without attracting any potential 
buyers.
I cant see that BMs actions could fairly be considered unnecessary.
On the second  issue,  BM commissioned two professional valuations, which were both at 
£65,000. Theres no other valuation available to me. Miss B says her selling  agent  valued 
the property at £98,000, but thats not quite correct.  The agreement with the selling agent 
records only that £98,000 was to be the asking price. Asking  prices  arent valuations.  
Miss B says the agents had told her of interest in the property at about  £89,000, and that this 
proves that a price  a lot higher than £65,000  could have been  achieved. However the 
completion statement  states that the sale was completed on 24 October  2011.  So there was 
plenty of time for higher  offers  to be made  by anybody  interested.  Had the property been 
worth £98,000, or even  £89,000, a buyer would have made an offer within  that period.
Theres no evidence that BM sold the property at an undervalue, and I consider it was 
entitled to rely on the professional advice which it received.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Ref: DRN36172573Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 July 2019.
