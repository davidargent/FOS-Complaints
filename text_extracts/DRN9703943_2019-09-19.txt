K822xcomplaint
Mr C complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  didnt carry out 
sufficient affordability checks before lending to him.
background 
Mr C had 28 loans from Sunny between February 2014 and December 2017, as seen in the 
table at the end of this document. He says he believes Sunny would have declined  his loan 
applications had it carried out a full and proper assessment of his financial circumstances.
Sunny says it carried out creditworthiness checks and assessed Mr Cs ability to afford the 
repayments. It says it acted responsibly  by approving the loans, although it accepts loan 1 
may not have been suitable  for Mr Cs needs.  It offered  to refund interest on this loan.
Mr C did not accept this offer as he says his pattern of borrowing for the other  loans should  
have indicated to Sunny that he may be in financial difficulties.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld. She found that loans 2 and 3 
were approved whilst  Mr Cs first loan account  was still active  and that he was allowed to 
continually draw down  on this first loan account  in a way that was unsuitable for long periods 
of borrowing. She acknowledged  that Sunny had agreed to uphold the complaint about 
loan 1, but recommended loans 2 onwards should also be upheld  as these loans had the 
same effect as continually  allowing Mr C to draw  down on the initial loan. Our adjudicator 
added that, by loan 5, she considered Mr Cs pattern of borrowing indicated he was 
becoming persistently  reliant on this type of borrowing.
Our adjudicator recommended  that Sunny should  refund interest  and charges on loans 2 to 
28 (plus 8% statutory interest), as well as on loan 1, for which  Sunny had already made an 
offer. She added that negative  information should  be removed from Mr Cs file for loans 1 to 
4 and that loan 5 onwards  should  be removed from Mr Cs credit file.
Sunny initially accepted  the adjudicators recommendation, but subsequently responded to 
say that it didnt consider Mr Cs borrowing  pattern showed he was persistently reliant on the 
loans until after it had approved his tenth  loan. It said its affordability assessments were  
sufficiently robust until that point.
Mr C did not accept Sunnys revised  offer.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr C could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN97039432But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr C could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  
repayments on time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it 
ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a borrower wont  be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely to be able to make  their repayments without 
borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Cs complaint.  As Sunny has already agreed to 
uphold loan 1, I wont consider it further here.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loans 2-4 would have shown that 
Mr C:
oHad already made 13 draw downs on his running loan account (loan 1) and 
his outstanding balance was almost  £1,000  on several occasions during the 
15 months the account was running;
oWas approved for loans 2 and 3 whilst loan 1 was still active  with over £500  
still to pay;
oHad been paying high interest  rates on loans intended for short-term use for 
over 18 months.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr C, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Ref: DRN97039433Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Cs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
5. I say this because:
From  loan 5 onwards  Mr C was provided  with a new loan within  weeks  of a previous 
one and often  had overlapping loans. So Sunny ought to have realised  it was more 
likely than not Mr C was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his 
previous loan was leaving  in his finances  and that Mr Cs indebtedness was 
increasing unsustainably.
Mr C wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan  27 was 
taken out 2.5 years  after loan 2 and it was for three  times the amount. Mr C had paid 
large amounts  of interest to, in effect,  service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mr C lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 2 onwards 
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Cs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Mr Cs 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  2 to 28, in addition  to the offer Sunny has already 
made on loan 1, and Sunny should  put things right.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint. Elevate Credit International Limited (trading  as 
Sunny) should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr C paid on all the loans;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
Remove any negative  information about loans 1 to 4 from Mr Cs credit file.
The number of loans  taken from loan 5 onwards means any information recorded  
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 5 to 28 should be removed from 
Mr Cs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr C a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 October  2019.
