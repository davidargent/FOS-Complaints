K820x#14complaint
Mr A has complained about HomeServe  Membership Limited (HomeServe) cancelling  a 
number of insurance policies.
background
Mr A held a Plumbing and Drainage Plus policy, an Electrics Cover policy and a HomeServe 
Combined policy with HomeServe  (the policies).
In December 2018, HomeServe cancelled Mr As policies. It said it had decided  to do this 
because of Mr As abusive behaviour towards its staff over the telephone.
Mr A complained. Mr A didnt accept HomeServes reason for cancelling  his policies  he 
said its staff had continued to speak with him over the phone  so there wasnt  a problem. He 
added that HomeServes staff shouldve notified him of its intention to cancel his policies.
HomeServe said the terms  and conditions of Mr As policies allow  it to cancel them  if a 
customer is abusive to its staff. It also said the staff member Mr A spoke with wouldnt have 
known that HomeServe had decided to cancel his policies  at the time he spoke with him.
As Mr A remained unhappy, he referred his complaint  to our service.  
One of our investigators  didnt uphold the complaint.  He said having listened to the 
telephone calls provided, he found  Mr As conduct  towards HomeServes staff to be 
unacceptable. So, he thought HomeServe  was entitled to cancel Mr As policies in line with 
the terms and conditions.
Mr A didnt agree and asked for an ombudsman to review things. He said his entire  customer  
journey with HomeServe had to be considered  including his previous complaints with it. 
Mr A said his relationship  with HomeServe  continued even  after the telephone calls in which 
it says he was abusive to its staff.  He added that he didnt believe that HomeServes 
customer service  department wouldnt have known of the decision to cancel his policies, and 
so they shouldve notified him.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not upholding it. Ill 
explain why.
HomeServe says it was entitled to cancel Mr As policies under the terms and conditions. 
Ive been provided  with the relevant terms. The terms  for Mr As Plumbing and Drainage 
Plus policy say:
HomeServe  may cancel this policy by giving you at least  7 days notice in writing to the last 
address you provided  us if youre seriously  in breach of the terms of your policy.  Examples 
of a serious breach include  if you use threatening or abusive behaviour towards  our 
engineers or staff.
Mr As other policies include the same term.
Ref: DRN68009172I can see that on 3 December 2018, HomeServe wrote to Mr A explaining that because of 
allegations from its staff about his behaviour towards them, his policies would automatically 
expire on 10 December  2018.
Im satisfied that HomeServe provided Mr A with seven days notice as per the terms and 
conditions of the policies. So, what I now have to consider is whether it was reasonable for 
HomeServe to have  cancelled  them.
HomeServe has provided four telephone call recordings  between Mr A and members of its 
staff in October 2018. Having listened to these, Im satisfied that in all four calls Mr A was 
abusive towards HomeServes staff.   
Mr A has said that because of the stress caused  by his entire customer  journey  with 
HomeServe, he reacted  as any reasonable person would.  I havent  considered  the merits of 
the other complaints Mr A made to HomeServe as these would need to be considered  
separately by our service.  But Ive reviewed the final response  letters  issued by HomeServe 
and I can see the customer service Mr A experienced wasnt good. So, I do appreciate why 
he became frustrated during the phone  calls with HomeServes staff. That said,  Im not 
persuaded that Mr As poor customer service experience justifies  his unacceptable conduct 
during the telephone calls Ive listened to. So, I dont think it was unreasonable of 
HomeServe to rely on the above term to cancel Mr As policies.
Mr A has also said that the member  of staff hed been accused of using abusive behaviour  
towards was happy to continue speaking with him and did so before his policies were  
cancelled. Hes also said that he ought to have been  made  aware that his policies were 
being cancelled  in a particular call with this staff member.
While the staff member may have  been happy to continue speaking with Mr A, HomeServe 
made the decision to cancel  the policies and I cant fault this decision in the circumstances. 
In addition, the policies werent cancelled straight  away as HomeServe needed to investigate  
the allegations made by staff members and liaise with the underwriter of the policy.  I dont 
think it was unreasonable for HomeServes  staff members to continue  dealing with Mr A 
whilst the decision was made.
I understand why Mr A is unhappy that he wasnt made aware his policies had been  
cancelled when he spoke  with the member  of staff on the phone. But Im satisfied by 
HomeServes explanation that the decision to end its relationship  with Mr A wasnt  made 
known to the staff member Mr A spoke with at the time. So I dont  think he was treated 
unfairly in this instance.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 May 2019.
