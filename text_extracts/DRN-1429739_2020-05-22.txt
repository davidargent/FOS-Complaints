The complaint
Miss B has complained about loans granted to her by Elevate Credit International Limited 
trading as Sunny (Sunny or the lender). Miss B says the loans were unaffordable and 
should not have been agreed as she was borrowing from other short term lenders at that 
time. 
Miss B has brought her complaint to this Service through a claims management company. I 
will refer to Miss B throughout this decision for simplicity.
What happened
Sunny agreed 10 loans for Miss B from July 2018 to May 2019. The loans were all 
instalment loans to be repaid over six months and ranged in value from £100 to £300. The 
below table sets out some of the information Sunny has provided about these loans (with 
numbers rounded to the nearest pound). As the table shows many of the loans ran 
concurrently and all were repaid.

Our adjudicator upheld Miss Bs complaint in part and recommended that Sunny refund all of 
the interest and charges she paid on loans 6 to 10. Sunny disagreed with this 
recommendation. The lender said it carried out an appropriate affordability assessment for 
each loan and Miss B paid them all on time or early so it seems that the loans were 
affordable for her.
Miss B didnt respond to the adjudicators recommendation or provide any further information 
for consideration. 
The complaint has now come to me, as an ombudsman, for review and final decision.What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending  including the 
relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Ive followed that 
approach here. 
The Financial Conduct Authority was the regulator when Miss B took out her loans. The 
relevant rules and guidance set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook said that for all loans 
Sunny needed to check that Miss B could afford to meet her repayments in a sustainable 
manner. This meant Miss B being able to meet her repayments out of her normal income 
without having to go without or borrow further. 
The regulations werent prescriptive about what checks Sunny needed to carry out in order 
to reasonably assess whether or not Miss B would be able to meet her repayments 
sustainably. But the regulations said that such checks needed to be proportionate. This 
suggests that the same checks might not be the appropriate thing to do for all consumers, or 
for the same consumer in all circumstances.
In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed checks
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. 
Sunny says it asked Miss B for information about her income and expenses each time she 
applied for a loan. The lender recorded Miss Bs monthly income as £1,588 to £1,955 and 
her monthly expenses as ranging from approximately £525 to £1,355. It seems she had 
about £400 left as a minimum each month to meet her loan repayments. 
Sunny also said that it used information from third party credit reference agencies to ensure 
the loans were affordable for Miss B and to check her credit history, though it hasnt provided 
the results of these checks. 
Miss Bs first three loans ran concurrently but, even considering this, it seems from the 
information she gave to Sunny that she would have enough to be able to meet her combined 
repayments for all three. I have considered that Miss B borrowed over several months 
without fully repaying her loans but the amounts she borrowed werent increasing. 
Altogether, I cant say that Ive seen enough strong indications to suggest that Sunny should 
have gone further in its checks for these loans or declined to lend to her. 
However, I do think Sunny ought to have carried out more comprehensive checks when
Miss B returned to borrow her fourth loan having paid off her first three loans. Shed been indebted to Sunny for about five months at this point and it seems still had a need for credit, 
taking out the same amount as shed initially borrowed.  
Miss B hasnt provided her credit file or any bank statements so I have limited information 
about her financial situation or how she was managing any existing credit commitments.  So 
I dont have enough information to determine what Sunny might have found out about her 
circumstances and whether it would have declined to lend to her at that point. My 
conclusions  are the same for loans 5 and 6.
Miss B took out six loans between July 2018 and January 2019. From the information Sunny 
provided, Miss B borrowed in July, August and September 2018, taking out £650 altogether 
across her first three loans. When she repaid a loan, she took out another one, borrowing 
again in December and then taking two in January. 
When making my decision, I have borne in mind that the purpose of short term lending is to 
address a temporary shortfall in income. Sunny has explained that its customers can take 
out several loans at any one time which offers a degree of flexibility. I accept that point, but 
in Miss Bs case however, I think the emerging pattern of borrowing continuously and taking 
out further credit most months is suggestive of someone who has an ongoing need for credit 
not just a temporary shortfall in income. 
In February 2019 Miss B took applied for her seventh loan which would commit her to 
repaying a total of £600 across four loans. Miss Bs first loan was for £300 and she was still 
indebted to Sunny for an even greater amount some seven months later. So it doesnt seem 
to me that shed managed to make any inroads into her debt in that time.
Sunny has said that Miss B repaid all her loans, sometimes early. Successfully repaying 
loans however, doesnt necessarily equate to being able to repay them sustainably, in other 
words without having to borrow again from elsewhere or going without. 
Taking everything into account, I think Sunny should have stopped lending to Miss B when 
she asked for her seventh loan, in other words in February 2019. Shed been continuously in 
debt to Sunny for about seven months by then and I think at that point, if not before, the 
pattern of lending itself indicated that Miss B wasnt managing to repay her loans in a 
sustainable way. I think Sunny should have recognised this and declined her seventh and 
subsequent loans.
I think Miss B lost out when Sunny agreed loan 7 and went on to agree more loans for her 
because these loans unfairly prolonged her indebtedness and allowed her to take expensive 
credit intended for short term use over an extended period of time. The number of loans she 
borrowed and the length of time she repeatedly borrowed over was likely to be seen 
negatively by other lenders, potentially keeping her in the market for high cost loans. 
Putting things right
As Ive explained above, I find that Sunny was irresponsible to have agreed further credit for 
Miss B from and including her seventh loan taken out in February 2019. In order to put 
things right for her, Sunny should
refund all interest and charges Miss B paid on loans 7 to 10; and
pay interest on all these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to 
the dates of settlement; and
remove all information about these loans from Miss Bs credit file because any 
information recorded about them is adverse.
 *HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I am upholding Miss Bs complaint and require Elevate Credit 
International Limited trading as Sunny to put things right for her as Ive outlined. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 19 June 2020.
