The complaint
Mr and Mrs D complain that First Holiday Finance Limited wont refund to them the money 
that they paid for some holiday club membership points. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs D entered into an agreement for a trial membership of a holiday club in March 
2011 which they paid for using a loan from First Holiday Finance. They traded-in their trial 
membership for some holiday club membership points in July 2011. The price of the 
membership points was £18,090, the trial membership was given a trade-in value of £5,995 
and they made an advance payment of £500 so the amount due from them was £11,595. Mr 
and Mrs D entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with First Holiday Finance for a loan of 
that amount and agreed to make 144 monthly repayments of £165.25 to First Holiday 
Finance. The loan was repaid in October 2011. Mr and Mrs D upgraded to a different type of 
membership in September 2012, they traded in their membership points and paid for the 
remainder of the price using a loan from a different finance provider. 
Mr and Mrs Ds representative made claims to First Holiday Finance under sections 75 and 
140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in 2016. It said that the holiday company didnt 
conduct a proper assessment of Mr and Ms Ds financial position and ability to repay the 
loan, applied considerable pressure to them to procure their agreement to the loan and 
breached EU Law. It also said that the holiday company misrepresented the membership to 
Mr and Mrs D and breached the contract because the membership was illegal. 
First Holiday Finance didnt provide a substantive response to those claims so a complaint 
was made to this service. Mr and Mrs Ds representative also says that a commission was 
paid by First Holiday Finance to the holiday company that wasnt disclosed to Mr and Mrs D. 
The holiday company then provided information about Mr and Mrs Ds memberships.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Ds complaint should be upheld. She 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale and she didnt think 
that the holiday company had breached the contract. She said that she hadnt seen enough 
to suggest that the relationship between Mr and Mrs D and First Holiday Finance was unfair 
and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was 
unfair. She didnt consider that First Holiday Finance had acted incorrectly in connection with 
any commission paid to the holiday company and she didnt think that the acquisition 
agreement or the loan agreement was voidable. She also said that she hadnt seen anything 
persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs D.
Mr and Mrs Ds representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It says that the agreement provides for termination if the maintenance 
fees arent paid which makes Mr and Mrs Ds relationship with First Holiday Finance unfair. It 
has referred to a decision issued by this service on a complaint about the type of 
membership to which Mr and Mrs D upgraded in September 2012 in which it was found that 
the charges were unfair. It says that the charges payable under the acquisition agreement 
are unfair and that the agreement is unfair pursuant to section 140A. It has also provided a 
generic submission from counsel about the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Ds complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Ds claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not First 
Holiday Finances response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Ive not been provided with a copy of the trial membership agreement or the loan 
agreement that Mr and Mrs D signed in March 2011 and Ive not been provided with 
complete copies of the acquisition agreement and loan agreement that they signed in 
July 2011  and its not clear which of those arrangements theyre complaining about 
so Ive in considered both sets of agreements in this decision;
Mr and Mrs D then traded in their membership points and upgraded to a different 
type of membership in September 2012 which they paid for using a loan from a 
different finance provider  but as that arrangement wasnt financed using a loan 
from First Holiday Finance, I cant consider that arrangement in this decision;
Im not persuaded that theres any evidence to show that the trial membership was 
misrepresented to Mr and Mrs D or that the holiday company breached the terms of 
that agreement;
Mr and Mrs D traded in their trial membership in July 2011 and then upgraded to a 
different type of membership in September 2012;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that that membership points 
were misrepresented to them or that the holiday company breached the terms of the 
acquisition agreement;
if the trial membership or the membership points had been misrepresented to Mr and 
Mrs D or there had been a breach of contract by the holiday company, I dont 
consider it to be likely that they would have then entered into another agreement with 
the holiday company in September 2012 and agreed to pay a further £12,095 to it for 
another membership;
Mr and Mrs Ds representative has referred to a judgment of an overseas court which 
it says makes the agreements null and void  but both the trial membership 
agreement and the acquisition agreement have now ended and Im not persuaded 
that the judgment referred to by Mr and Mrs Ds representative shows that theres 
been a breach of contract for which First Holiday Finance would be liable under 
section 75;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of any applicable EU law or other regulation for which First Holiday Finance would be 
liable in these circumstances;
the holiday company has described the holidays that Mr and Mrs D have taken since 
they entered into the trial membership agreement and Im not persuaded that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company in these 
circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Ds representative says that the holiday company didnt conduct a proper 
assessment of Mr and Ms Ds financial position and ability to repay the loan - First 
Holiday Finance hasnt provided any evidence about its assessments of the 
affordability of the loans for Mr and Mrs D but the loan that was made to them in July 
2011 was repaid three months later when a payment of £11,408.81 was made to the 
account;
Ive seen no evidence to show that the loan that was made to them in March 2011 
hasnt been repaid and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
the loans werent affordable for Mr and Mrs D when they were made to them;
the loans were made to Mr and Mrs D in March and July 2011 but Ive seen no 
evidence to show that they asked First Holiday Finance for any information about the 
affordability assessments that it conducted before their representative made claims 
to it in 2016 - I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have raised 
any concerns about the affordability assessments before then;
Mr and Mrs Ds representative says that the holiday company applied considerable 
pressure to Mr and Mrs D to procure their agreement to the loan - but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they were unduly pressurised 
into entering into the purchase agreements or loan agreements in March and July 
2011 or that the holiday company used unacceptable sales practices against them  
if they were concerned about the way that those agreements were sold to them, I 
consider that it would be reasonable to expect them not to have entered into another 
agreement with the holiday company in September 2012;
Mr and Mrs Ds representative says that First Holiday Finance should have told them 
about any commission that it paid to the holiday company for arranging the loans  
but Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was 
paid by First Holiday Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that First Holiday Finance 
wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any 
regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that First Holiday 
Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr and 
Mrs D risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mr and Mrs Ds representative has referred to a decision issued by this service in 
which it was found that the charges were unfair  but this service considers each 
complaint on its individual merits;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the charges that Mr and 
Mrs D were required to pay under the purchase agreements that they entered into in 
March and July 2011 were unfair and I understand that the holiday company 
suspends memberships if maintenance fees arent paid  but Ive seen no evidence 
to show that Mr and Mrs D didnt pay the maintenance fees that were due for their memberships or that their membership points were suspended or terminated before 
they upgraded their membership in September 2012; 
Mr and Mrs Ds representative has provided a generic submission from counsel 
about the holiday company but Im not persuaded that it shows that Mr and Mrs Ds 
relationship with First Holiday Finance was unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Ds 
relationship with First Holiday Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely 
that a court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and 
Mrs D and First Holiday Finance in these circumstances;
First Holiday Finance didnt issue a substantive response to Mr and Mrs Ds claims 
so I cant say that its response to their claims was fair and reasonable  but if it had 
properly responded to their claims I consider that it would have been fair and 
reasonable for it not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs D for the issues that theyve have had with their 
memberships, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances 
for me to require First Holiday Finance to refund to them any of the money that 
theyve paid under the loan agreements, to pay them any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ds complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D and Mrs D to 
accept or reject my decision before 29 March 2023.
