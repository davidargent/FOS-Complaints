The complaint
Mr K complains that Tesco Personal Finance plc, trading as Tesco Bank, wont refund to him 
the money that he paid for a 45kg bale of used mixed denim jackets.
 
What happened
Mr K used his Tesco Bank credit card in April 2021 to pay £350 for a 45kg bale of used 
mixed denim jackets. He says that some of the jackets were damaged so he complained to 
the supplier but it said that he would have to pay to return them. He then claimed a refund 
from Tesco Bank. It said that there was no ground for it dispute the payment under the 
chargeback rules. It also considered his claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974 but said that it was unable to determine any breach of contract. It acknowledged that 
there had been a delay in assessing Mr Ks claim under section 75 and paid him £25 
compensation. Mr K wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She said that there 
were no grounds for Tesco Bank to raise a chargeback and there was no proof of a breach 
of contract or misrepresentation so she couldnt say that Tesco Bank had acted 
unreasonably in declining his section 75 claim and not being able to help him with regards to 
a refund for the goods. Mr K has asked for his complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Tesco Bank considered Mr Ks claim under the chargeback rules but didnt consider 
that it had grounds to claim a chargeback so it then considered his claim under 
section 75 but said that it was unable to determine any breach of contract and it paid 
him £25 compensation for its delay in considering his claim under section 75;
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Ks complaint about Tesco Bank under section 75, I must be 
satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier 
and that Tesco Banks response to that claim wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not 
determining the outcome of Mr Ks claim under section 75 as only a court would be 
able to do that;
the suppliers terms and conditions, which Mr K had accepted, say: Return deliveries 
are strictly returned at your cost  We will check and weigh the goods upon their 
return and once this is done, a credit note will be issued;
Mr K contacted the supplier about his order and was told that he could return it but 
that he would have to pay for the cost of returning it  as hed agreed to that when he 
made his order, I dont consider that the supplier acted incorrectly in saying that he 
had to pay for the cost of returning his order;
Mr K clearly wasnt satisfied with the quality of the goods that he received and hes 
provided photos showing some of the damaged items  but Im not persuaded that 
hes provided enough evidence to show that the supplier hasnt acted in accordance 
with the terms and conditions that hed accepted or that theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
Tesco Bank accepted that there was a delay in considering Mr Ks claim under 
section 75 and paid him £25 compensation - I consider that to have been a fair and 
reasonable response to Mr Ks section 75 claim in these circumstances;
if a consumer disputes a card payment, the card issuer may be able to make a 
chargeback claim to the merchant under the relevant card scheme to try to settle the 
dispute;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made but if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules  and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success  I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
Tesco Bank considered whether a chargeback claim could be made in these 
circumstances but concluded that there was no ground to dispute the payment  and 
as Im not persuaded that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by 
the supplier, I consider that its response to his chargeback claim was also fair and 
reasonable and I dont consider that there was any requirement for Tesco Bank to 
make a chargeback claim for the payment that Mr K had made to the supplier and Im 
not persuaded that it acted unfairly or unreasonably in not doing so; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Tesco Bank to refund to Mr K the £350 that he paid to the supplier, to pay him any 
further compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ks complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 April 2022.
