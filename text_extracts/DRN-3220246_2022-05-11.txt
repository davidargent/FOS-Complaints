Complaint
Mr P says Barclays Bank UK PLC mis-sold him a Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) 
policy with a credit card. He says the redress he received from the mis-sale hasnt been 
calculated correctly and he is due back more money than he got.
Background
I see that one of our adjudicators provided Mr P with a view about this complaint. They 
said that they didnt think the PPI redress had been incorrectly calculated. In fact, they 
said that Mr P had got back somewhat more than he was owed. The adjudicator 
therefore said we shouldnt uphold his complaint.
As the complaint couldnt be resolved informally, it has come to me for an ombudsmans 
final decision.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im afraid Im not upholding the complaint.
Id like to start by saying I certainly dont doubt Mr P honestly and genuinely feels now that 
the money he was paid back hasnt been calculated correctly. Much of this, in my view, is 
due to the poor way Barclays has handled the matter and its communications to Mr P 
have been confusing and unclear. Im not surprised Mr P has difficulty accepting whats 
been said. However, the central point here is that PPI was mis-sold to Mr P with a credit 
card  of that there is no dispute.
Unfortunately Barclays at first said there were two PPI policies but we now know this all 
relates to just one credit card account taken out in 1994 and closed in 2001. It looks like 
the initial card account ended in numbers 0333 but the following numbers were linked to 
the account over the years  4004, 3009, and 6248.
Barclays further confused matters by issuing several cheques to Mr P to compensate him 
for the mis-sale. It also estimated some of the PPI amount hed paid because statements 
were no longer available  we do recognise this as an approach when old data no longer 
exists.
Barclays issued cheques for £2,767.37 and £869.36 to Mr P which he banked. It also 
issued another one for £1550.83, but this was later cancelled and never banked by Mr P.
Unfortunately, Barclays then pointed out that Mr P had actually made a successful claim 
on the PPI policy, in 2000, for unemployment. The payments, over several months, 
amounted to £5,600. Clearly, this was another failure by Barclays in that it should have 
noticed such obvious features on his account before paying him any money at all.
The upshot of all this is that Mr P has banked two cheques of £2,767.37 and £869.36 for 
the mis-sold PPI premiums he paid, plus interest. However, because hed already been 
paid for the successful claim (above), Barclays is entitled to subtract this amount from the 
redress paid for the mis-sale. This is in accordance with the rules, because our role in 
such cases is only to help put consumers back in the position they would have been in 
had they never bought PPI in the first place. Here, in this case, Mr P has been paid 
£2,767.37 and £869.36 and in the circumstances Barclays has said it wont claw these 
payments back.
In short, Mr P received the above payments of £2,767.37 and £869.36 plus the £5,600 
for the successful unemployment claim; hes therefore had much more money back, 
than he ever paid in for the PPI premiums.
I see Mr P has provided us with copies of his old card statements and implied much of 
the estimated PPI redress calculated by Barclays is too low. But Im afraid all this 
becomes irrelevant because hes already effectively been over-compensated, by some 
considerable way.
Im very sorry to disappoint Mr P. I acknowledge the difficult journey hes had with getting 
an explanation but I understand he was also paid a small amount for distress and 
inconvenience by Barclays.
To be clear then, there is no evidence that Mr P is due back any more redress. He was 
paid some money for all the PPI premiums he paid (with interest added) and also had a 
claim for unemployment paid in 2000 which amounted to more than hed ever paid in 
premiums.
He isnt due anything else Im afraid.
My final decision
I do not uphold Mr Ps complaint.
I do not direct Barclays Bank UK PLC to do anything.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, I am required to ask Mr P to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 March 2022.
