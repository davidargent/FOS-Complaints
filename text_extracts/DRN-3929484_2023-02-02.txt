The complaint
Mrs C complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Aqua (NewDay) was irresponsible when 
it opened a credit card facility for her.
What happened
NewDay opened a credit card account for Mrs C in January 2020 in with a credit limit of 
£900. This type of credit was an open-ended or running account facility. NewDay 
subsequently increased Mrs Cs credit limit to £950 in June 2021.
Mrs C complained to NewDay that the credit was unaffordable for her. She said she was 
in a lot of debt at the time and NewDay should have seen this and not opened the 
account. 
NewDay said it acted correctly in providing Mrs C with her account and didnt uphold her 
complaint. It said that it took into consideration information she provided and her credit file 
record. She didnt have any adverse information on her credit file and she met the 
acceptance criteria. 
NewDay also said that it reviews a customers account alongside external credit reference 
agency (CRA) data and if it feels a credit limit increase or decrease is suitable, then one will 
be offered. In this instance it increased Mrs Cs limit as her account balance was over the 
agreed credit limit following the end of a payment freeze. It said it increased the limit to avoid 
any future over-limit fees and reporting over-limit balances to the CRAs. 
Mrs C brought her complaint to us. Our investigator assessed the complaint and found that 
NewDay was irresponsible to have opened the account for Mrs C. They concluded that it 
was unlikely Mrs C would be able to repay the credit within a reasonable period of time given 
her existing debts and her income level. They recommended that NewDay pays Mrs C 
compensation for this.
NewDay disagreed with our investigators recommendation. It said that Mrs C had access 
to her partners income and it took this into consideration in its assessment along with her 
existing debt levels. NewDay also said that Mrs C had made more than the minimum 
payment on her account and didnt incur any fees in the first seven months. 
The complaint has now come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also had regard to the regulators rules and guidance on responsible lending (set out 
in its consumer credit handbook  CONC) which lenders, such as NewDay, need to 
abide by. NewDay will be aware of these, and our approach to this type of lending is set 
out on our website, so I wont refer to the regulations in detail here but will summarise 
them.
Before entering into a credit agreement, NewDay needed to check that Mrs C could afford 
to repay the credit out of her usual means, within a reasonable period of time, without 
having to borrow further and without experiencing financial difficulty or other adverse 
consequences. The checks needed to be proportionate to the nature of the credit, for 
example the amount offered, and to Mrs Cs particular circumstances.
With this in mind, my considerations are did NewDay complete reasonable and proportionate 
checks when it opened the account for Mrs C to satisfy itself that she would be able to repay 
the credit offered within a reasonable period of time? If it didnt do this, what would 
reasonable and proportionate checks have shown and, ultimately, did NewDay make a fair 
lending decision? 
Mrs C told NewDay her salary was £16,000 (about £1,200 a month net) when she applied 
for the account and that her partners monthly income was about £1,600. NewDay recorded 
that she was employed and her existing debts came to £11,800. NewDay said it used a CRA 
tool to check what Mrs C said about her income and to estimate her expenses and found no 
adverse information on her credit file, such as county court judgements, defaults or arrears, 
though it noted that she had a high level of existing debt.
As NewDay will know, the checks it was required to carry out before lending need to be 
proportionate to the loan specifics relative to the circumstances of the borrower. More 
detailed checks might be proportionate where their financial situation is such that the credit 
may be expected to have a more significant impact. As NewDay noted, Mrs C had high 
levels of existing debts. It seems likely to me that she would need to spend a sizeable 
proportion her income repaying these, and it would have been proportionate in this case to 
look further into her circumstances before lending to her. I appreciate NewDay sense-
checked Mrs Cs income and estimated her expenses but I cant see that it verified what she 
was earning or investigated what her expenses were. 
Mrs C confirmed her salary at the time and told us that she was in receipt of £140 a month 
child benefit as she had two dependents. She said she was spending between £400 and 
£500 a month repaying debt, and her living costs came to about £830 including food, 
childcare and phone bills. Mrs C provided a copy of her credit file, her payslips and bank 
statements. Mrs Cs bank statements confirm the payment amounts for her existing loans as 
at least £300, and payments of at least £200 with her credit balances across mail order and 
credit cards of over £8,500. I can see from her payslips that her income varied and could be 
as low as £1,040 a month, as in December 2019 for example. 
NewDay said in its response to our investigators view that Mrs C had access to her 
partners income and it took this into consideration in its assessment. The statements Mrs C 
provided were from a joint account. While I can see that there are deposits from others into 
her bank account there were also other debt repayments, including short term loan 
repayments, and frequent gambling transactions, for example amounting to over £1,100 in 
January 2020. Altogether, I dont think further checks would have shown NewDay that Mrs C 
would be able to meet her repayments for this account without difficulty. Ive concluded as 
our investigator did that it was irresponsible to have opened the account for her.
NewDay also said in its response that Mrs C made more than the minimum payment on her 
account and didnt incur any fees in the first seven months. Mrs C then continued to repay 
more than the minimum each month and her external debt balance reduced. The account 
management information NewDay provided also shows that while Mrs Cs debts dipped 
below £10,000 in one month the general trend was upwards and the last recorded month in 
mid-2021 showed Mrs Cs total debts as over £17,000. And while Mrs C was making more than the minimum payment she was spending her available credit each month  once her 
balance went over £900 in August 2020 it remained above this (aside from two months) and 
she was over her £950 limit for most of the last 15 months of data.   
In summary, I think NewDay should have seen that there was a risk that Mrs C would have 
difficulty meeting her repayments for this credit and further checks would likely have 
confirmed this. I think it was irresponsible to provide her with this facility and Ive set out 
below what it needs to do now to put things right for her. 
Putting things right
As I dont think NewDay ought to have opened the account, I dont think its fair for it to be 
able to charge any interest or fees under the credit agreement. But I think Mrs C should pay 
back the amount she borrowed. Therefore, NewDay should:
Rework the account removing all interest and charges that have been applied. 
If the rework results in a credit balance, this should be refunded to Mrs C along with 
8% simple interest per year* calculated from the date of each overpayment to the 
date of settlement. NewDay should also remove all adverse information regarding 
this account from Mrs Cs credit file. 
Or, if after the rework there is still an outstanding balance, NewDay should arrange 
an affordable repayment plan with Mrs C for the remaining amount. Once Mrs C has 
cleared the balance, any adverse information in relation to the account should be 
removed from her credit file. 
If NewDay has sold the debt to a third party, it should arrange to either buy back the debt 
from the third party or liaise with them to ensure the redress set out above is carried out 
promptly. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to deduct tax from any award of interest. It must 
give Mrs C a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if she asks for one. If it 
intends to apply the refund to reduce an outstanding balance, it must do so after deducting 
the tax.
My final decision
As Ive explained above, I am upholding Mrs Cs complaint about NewDay Ltd 
trading as Aqua and it now needs to take the above steps to put things right for her.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 March 2023.
