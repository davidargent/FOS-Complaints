K821x#15complaint
Ms H complains about the way in which Capital Source Finance Ltd (trading  as 
www.DebtLegal.co.uk) treated  her.
background
Ms H entered into a debt management plan (DMP)  managed by DebtLegal in 2013.  In 
May 2018, DebtLegal withdrew from the DMP market so Ms Hs DMP was transferred to 
another business.
Ms H had a number of concerns about  the way in which DebtLegal  handled her account 
including:
DebtLegal told Ms H it had sent emails which she didnt receive
DebtLegal failed  to send Ms H monthly  statements
DebtLegal continued to take the same  management  fee even though Ms H was 
paying less to her creditors 
DebtLegal charged the wrong  initial set up fee
DebtLegal marked Ms H down as a vulnerable customer
members of staff at DebtLegal shouted  at her on the phone
DebtLegal didnt  make Ms H aware  of changes in the terms and conditions  of her 
DMP
The investigator recommended  that Ms Hs complaint be upheld in part. He thought that 
DebtLegal had taken more in fees than it should have so he asked it to refund some  of the 
money to Ms H.
The investigator thought that DebtLegal should have told Ms H that one of her creditors  - 
limited company L - had changed  the way it communicated with third parties. The 
investigator asked DebtLegal to pay Ms H £150 compensation for the inconvenience this 
failure caused to her.
The investigator also thought that DebtLegal  should  refund the initial  deposit to Ms H as 
ordinarily it would have paid this amount  to Ms Hs creditors  once  the DMP ended.
DebtLegal agrees that it should have charged Ms H a slightly  lower set up fee but it doesnt  
consider that it should pay Ms H £150  compensation or that its appropriate  to refund the 
initial fee.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN45595892DebtLegal says that it kept 100% of Ms Hs first agreed payment of £100  in line with the 
terms of her DMP.  However, it agrees that instead  of retaining 100% of Ms Hs second  
payment of £70, it should have kept 75%.  DebtLegal  has agreed to refund the difference 
between the £170 that it retained and the £152.50 that it should  have retained.  I dont think  I 
need to say much more  about this.
I appreciate that Ms H still has some concerns about  certain aspects of her complaint such  
as DebtLegals  failure to give us call recordings and that her disposable income was always 
less than the figure DebtLegal said it was.
DebtLegal says that once  it stopped providing  debt counselling services,  it deleted the call 
recordings due to the cost of maintaining them. I understand that this is frustrating for Ms H 
but without this further evidence, I cant reasonably find that DebtLegal mistreated Ms H on 
the phone.
Although Ms H says that her disposable  income  was never  £100,  this is the figure  that 
DebtLegal used  for the initial fee received on 21 March 2013.  This figure also appears in 
client records for Ms H. So I cant reasonably find that DebtLegal made  a mistake.
As I agree with what  the investigator has told Ms H, I want to concentrate  on the aspects  of 
his recommendations  which DebtLegal  disagrees with.
incorrect balance figure 
Ms H was concerned that DebtLegal  gave  her an out of date outstanding balance  figure  from 
L. And that due to the fact that L had changed the way it communicated with businesses it 
wouldnt be possible to get an up to date balance before  DebtLegal stopped managing        
Ms Hs DMP.  
I cant see that DebtLegal made Ms H aware of Ls change in policy when it would have  
been helpful to do so. As a result, Ms H didnt have an accurate picture of her financial 
situation before transferring her DMP. I can appreciate that this caused Ms H some 
inconvenience. So I agree  with the investigator  that its reasonable to require DebtLegal to 
pay Ms H £150 compensation for this aspect of her complaint.
refund of initial fee
The relevant  term in Ms Hs agreement  with DebtLegal says that the initial fee is held as a 
security deposit. And that following successful repayment of debt to creditors in the agreed 
program, this deposit will be made  payable at the end of the agreement as a final payment to 
all outstanding creditors as a gesture of good  will.
I appreciate that DebtLegal has a number of concerns about  the investigators  
recommendation that it should refund the initial fee to Ms H. Ive taken  account  of these but I 
still agree  with the investigator that his recommendation is reasonable.
Although it wasnt DebtLegals choice to withdraw its services, it wasnt  Ms Hs choice  not to 
conclude her DMP with DebtLegal either. After Ms Hs DMP ended with DebtLegal,  she 
continued to make payments through a different debt management service. So I cant  
reasonably say that Ms H wouldnt have successfully completed  her DMP with DebtLegal if 
shed been given the chance to.
Ref: DRN45595893Despite referring to the payment to creditors as a gesture of good will, the term in Ms Hs 
agreement says that the payment will be made at end of the agreement. Ms H has now 
repaid her creditors so I consider it reasonable to require  DebtLegal  to refund the initial  fee 
direct to Ms H.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. In full and final settlement, I require  
Capital Source Finance Ltd to:
Pay Ms H £150; 
Refund Ms H the initial fee of £170  that she paid together with interest  of 8% simple a 
year on this amount  from the date on which DebtLegal ended Ms Hs DMP to the 
date of settlement;  and
Refund the additional £17.50 that it retained  from Ms Hs initial payment together with 
interest of 8% simple  a year on this amount from the date of payment to the date of 
settlement.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 7 June 2020.
