K820x#14complaint
Its been agreed in this case that Financial  Insurance  Company Limited  (FICL), as the 
insurer, should accept  responsibility for the complaint. To keep things simple,  Ill refer to 
FICL as the seller  in my decision.
Ms W says FICL mis-sold  her a payment protection insurance (PPI)  policy.
background
This complaint is about a PPI policy Ms W took out on a store card account in July 2002. It 
was added to her account when  she applied for the card in store.
Our adjudicator didnt uphold the complaint. Ms W disagreed with the adjudicators opinion 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach  to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website  and
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Ms Ws case.
Ive decided not to uphold Ms Ws complaint and Ill explain why.
I think FICL  made Ms W aware that she had a choice  about buying the PPI, and that she 
chose to take it. I say this because FICL  has given  us a copy of the store  card application form 
from the time of sale. This shows there was a separate section for PPI and that it is presented 
as optional. Ms W signed on the application  form to say she consented to the information  
contained in it. So I think this reflected what she wanted. Had Ms W not wanted the PPI she 
could have completed the application  and not ticked a box in the separate section agreeing to 
have the cover.
I cant be sure what happened at the time of sale when this application  form was completed by 
the parties, but based on what I know of how sales were conducted  and without further 
information to support  what Ms W is saying, I cannot safely conclude  anything other than the 
form demonstrates a fair reflection of what Ms W wanted at that time (and she signed  at the 
bottom of the application agreeing to have the card and PPI.)
So, on balance,  I think Ms W was aware the policy was optional and she agreed to take it 
out, knowing  it was something she could say no to.
This application was made by Ms W completing an application in a store. So because  of this, 
I dont think a recommendation  was made  by FICL.  So FICL didnt have to check  if the policy 
was suitable for her. But it still needed to make  sure it gave Ms W enough information to 
make an informed choice  whether  the policy was right for her, taking into account her 
personal circumstances.
Its possible the information FICL  gave Ms W about the PPI wasnt  as clear as it should  have  
been. So I need to consider if Ms W would have acted differently and not bought the policy, if 
better information had been provided.  And on balance I dont think  better  information  
wouldve led her to act differently.
Ref: DRN28978862I say this because  I think  the PPI could have been useful to Ms W in that her store card 
payments would be met in addition to any other provisions she held (she says she had 
sickness pay that would have covered her between 3 and 6 months) . The policy would  have 
provided additional cover for longer than her provisions at that time and would have been 
useful if Ms W had lost her job. I also couldnt  see any significant  or limiting terms that would 
have affected  Ms Ws decision to take the policy out either.
Im not sure FICL gave clear information  on the costs of the PPI policy, but I dont think  this 
would have affected Ms Ws decision to take out the policy for the reasons I have  already  
given. 
Ive taken into account all Ms Ws comments,  but for the reasons mentioned above, these 
points dont change  my conclusion.
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above,  I dont uphold Ms Ws complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 23 February  2019.
