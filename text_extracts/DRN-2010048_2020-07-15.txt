The complaint
Mr V is unhappy with what PayPal Europe Sarl& CIE, SCA did when he got in touch with it 
about a payment it had debited from his bank account.
What happened
In August 2019 Mr V set up an automatic payment to a merchant using his PayPal account. 
On 12 November the payment was debited from his account by the merchant and 
PayPal requested the funds from his bank. Later that day Mr V cancelled the payment 
arrangement.
The following day the merchant issued a refund for the payment which credited Mr Vs 
PayPal account. On 18 November he called Paypal to ask why funds had been debited from 
his bank account. PayPal said it hadnt yet received these and wasnt able to process a 
refund until that was the case. PayPal received the money two days later and Mr V was then 
able to transfer the refund into his bank account. However, he was unhappy with the time 
taken and said PayPal hadnt taken into account his disability (which caused him difficulty 
when reading long emails) and the Equality Act when communicating with him.
Our investigator didnt think PayPal had done anything wrong. She noted PayPals user 
agreement said its primary method of communication was by email. But it also offered a 
freephone number for customers to get in touch with it and in this case Mr V had been able 
to discuss his concerns over the phone. 
Mr V didnt agree so I need to reach a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked first at whether there was any delay by PayPal in processing Mr Vs refund. I 
dont think there was given this was made available on the same day it received the funds 
from his bank and Mr V was able to access the refund that day. 
Ive also thought about how PayPal communicated with Mr V. I understand Mr V has 
problems with his sight which make it difficult for him to read long emails. And under the 
Equality Act 2010, PayPal are required to make reasonable adjustments to assist customers 
with disabilities access their services. So Ive taken this into account when Ive considered if 
PayPal acted fairly and reasonably in Mr V's case. 
DRN-2010048PayPals says its primary method of communication is email but it does appear Mr V was 
able to contact it by telephone to discuss his concerns about the money that had been 
debited from his account. I can also see that after Mr V made a complaint (by email) PayPal 
called him in response to that. Its unfortunate Mr V wasnt able to initially answer that call 
but I can see PayPal made follow up calls and he was able to speak to an advisor a few 
days later. 
I understand Mr V was charged for one of the calls he made but that appears to be because 
he called a different number to the freephone one listed on PayPals website. So I cant say 
it should refund the charges he incurred here. And Ive not identified significant delay by 
PayPal in responding to Mr V. 
Overall while I appreciate the difficulties Mr V has with email, PayPal does appear to have 
alternative arrangements in place for those who have difficulty communicating in this way 
which Mr V was able to access in this case. And having accessed those alternatives, he was 
able to get his money refunded in a reasonable time. So I dont think its treated him unfairly.
My final decision
I've decided not to uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr V to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 August 2020.
