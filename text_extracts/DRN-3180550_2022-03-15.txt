The complaint
Ms B is unhappy with the way Unum Limited handled her claim for income protection.
What happened
The background to this complaint is set out in my provisional findings. In summary, Ms B 
needed to claim on her income protection plan following the onset of her illnesses. Her claim 
was accepted, however, Unum paid her too much benefit and so asked that she return the 
overpayment, which was over £5,000. Ms B was also unhappy with the way she was treated 
by Unum, including how she was spoken to over the phone. Unum offered her £250, but Ms 
B didnt think this was fair. 
I provisionally decided that Unum should increase its offer to £500 for the overall distress 
and inconvenience it caused her. I said that it should have handled her claim more promptly 
and that it should have offered her a repayment plan that suited her financial circumstances. 
Both Ms B and Unum accepted my provisional findings. And so, its now for me to make a 
final decision  no additional submissions were made in response to my provisional decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to implement my provisional decision, for all the reasons Ive 
already explained within it. Because there are no further arguments for me to consider, 
theres nothing more to say in relation to this complaint. Im upholding Ms Bs complaint and 
Unum must now pay her the additional compensation to a total of £500 for the distress and 
inconvenience cause. 
My final decision
I uphold Ms Bs complaint and Unum Limited must now pay her the remainder of 
compensation. Ms B is awarded a total of £500 compensation for the overall distress and 
inconvenience caused. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2022.
