Loan 4 was repaid in three instalments  as agreed. 
Loans 5 to 8 were all six monthly instalment loans. 
The interest Mrs R was due to repay on Loan 8 was about £808. MYJAR considered the 
complaint and wrote to Mrs R and offered to reimburse Mrs R for the interest repaid on 
Loan 7. That sum was then due to be set that off against the outstanding balance for Loan 8. 
MYJAR has told us that neither Mrs R nor her representative (at the time) responded. Mrs R 
is not represented anymore.
One of our adjudicators looked  at the complaint and she thought that Loans  4 to 8 ought to 
be the ones that MYJAR put right for Mrs R. She explained that the loan repayments for 
Loan 4 were particularly high and from Loan 6 she thought  that MYJAR ought  to have 
become aware  that Mrs R had taken  out six loans in six months  and the amounts increased 
over this period  and for the rest of the borrowing relationship with you. In my view, the 
pattern of lending itself shows  that the loans from here were unsustainable
MYJAR did not agree and asked for an ombudsman review.  Mrs Rs complaint remained  
unresolved and was passed to me for a decision.  
I have asked Mrs R for additional  information  late last year but I have  not received anything  
and so I am proceeding on the information I have now. 
Ref: DRN78574572my findings
I have considered all the available evidence  and arguments to decide what I consider  to be 
fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. We have set out our general 
approach to complaints about  short-term  lending - including  all of the relevant rules, 
guidance and good industry  practice  - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs R 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include: where a customers income  is particularly low; where the repayments  are 
particularly high; and/or  where the frequency of the loans and the length  of time over which  a 
customer has been given  loans need  to be looked  at: repeated  refinancing could signal that 
the borrowing  had become, or was becoming,  unsustainable.
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that MYJAR was required to establish 
whether Mrs R could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication  a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments.  But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines  sustainable as being the 
ability to repay without undue difficulties. In particular the customer  should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments,  and without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
I have carefully considered all of the arguments,  evidence and information provided  in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Rs complaint.
Loans 1 to 3 were ones which our adjudicator considered to have been lent to Mrs R 
satisfactorily and she has not disagreed with that and so I do not plan to review those three 
loans as they appear not to be in dispute.  But they remain relevant within the context  of this 
lending chain. 
I do note that Loans  1 to 3 were all taken close together and swiftly followed by an 
application for Loan 4. This was for a £1,000  loan to be repaid over three  instalments and 
each was about £505. This meant that Mrs R had applied for £1,425 in two weeks in 
February 2016. My view is that this alone  ought  to have prompted a full and comprehensive  
check on Mrs Rs financial position to ensure that MYJARs creditworthiness  assessment 
Ref: DRN78574573obligations were  met. Its explained its affordability  policy in detail and I have considered  all 
its figures. But the fact remains that the obvious  point to note was this huge  amount of 
lending in a very short  space of time.  
In addition to this, I consider that three separate instalments: one of £505 and two of £527, 
would have translated into a large proportion from her monthly  net declared income of 
£1,500 for several months. So, I think  these points all combined would have been enough to 
lead a responsible lender to not lend that £1,000  to Mrs R in February  2016.  
I uphold Mrs Rs complaint for Loan  4. 
 
Loan 5 was applied for the same  day that the final instalment on Loan 4 was repaid and 
does suggest  that Mrs R may have been borrowing sequentially which  is a sign,  in my view,  
of unsustainable  lending. This combined  with the lending history up to that point leads me to 
think that Mrs R ought  not to have been  approved for Loan 5. 
I have also looked  at the overall pattern of MYJARs lending  history with Mrs R, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR ought to have realised that 
it shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the circumstances of Mrs Rs case, I think that this point was reached by Loan  6. I say 
this because:
From  Loan 6 onwards Mrs R was provided with new loans on the same day she was 
settling the previous  ones. So MYJAR  ought  to have realised it was more likely  than 
not Mrs R was having to borrow  further  to cover the hole repaying her previous loan 
was leaving in her finances and that Mrs Rs indebtedness was increasing  
unsustainably.
Mrs R wasnt  making  any real inroads  to the amount she owed MYJAR.  Loan 8 was 
for £925 and was taken out one year after Mrs Rs first. And it was for a larger 
amount. Mrs R had paid large amounts  of interest to, in effect, service a debt to 
MYJAR over an extended period.
I think that Mrs R lost out because MYJAR  continued to provide borrowing from Loan 6 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Rs indebtedness by allowing  
him to take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended  period;
the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mrs Rs ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for 
these high-cost loans.
So, I am upholding the complaint about  Loans 4 to 8 (MYJAR has conceded  Loan  7) and 
MYJAR should put things right.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs R paid on Loans 4 to 8; and
Ref: DRN78574574pay interest of 8% simple  a year* on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about Loans 4 and 5 from Mrs Rs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from Loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  Loans 6 to 8 should be removed from 
Mrs Rs credit file.
* HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Mrs R a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, I am upholding Mrs Rs complaint in part. MYJAR Limited 
should do as I have set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 February  2020.
