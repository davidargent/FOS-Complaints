The complaint
Miss P complains that Greenwood Personal Credit Limited (referred to here as Provident) 
lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
Provident Personal Credit has explained Greenwoods Personal Credit was purchased by 
the Provident Financial Group and after amalgamating the terms and conditions, business 
processes and operating model to match Provident Personal Credit, Greenwoods was 
closed down in early 2014 with all outstanding debts being transferred to Provident. 
So I will refer to the respondent as Provident.
Miss P has complained about a series of home credit loans issued to her by Provident and 
by Greenwoods. This decision will be issued on both complaint cases. And for the purposes 
of these two complaints one Loan Table has been created.

One of our adjudicators looked at the whole of the lending and wrote to Provident to say that 
she thought that Loans 6 to 14 should be the ones that Provident put right for Miss P. 
In April 2020, one of Providents representatives engaged with Miss P and Provident has 
since offered to refund interest and charges for loans 6 to 16 (less tax) and remove any 
records of Loans 6 to 16 from Miss Ps credit file. The offer included the fact that the 
outstanding balances on some of the loans would be offset against the refunded sums due 
from Provident to her. Providents representative summarised this to Miss P: This would 
leave you with no outstanding balance and a cheque for £297.97. 
Miss P was unclear on some of the detail and around the outstanding balances. So, she has 
rejected the offer. Miss P has also referred to her original complaint made to Provident in 
which she said: Many of these loans were rolled over and taken out at the same time as my 
partners. The initial application used both our incomes, (my partners wages and my tax 
credit and child benefits).
And more recently Miss P has explained that the loan agent used the same income for each 
loan taken and that comprised of her partners wages, and their combined tax credits and 
child benefit. 
So, the combination of the confusion in relation to the offer and exactly what it covers, plus 
this part of the complaint she originally raised with Provident which she does not think has 
been addressed, has led to it being referred to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We have set out our general approach to complaints about high-cost (including home credit) 
lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our 
website. I have carefully considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in 
this context and what this all means for Miss Ps complaint.
Provident needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it did not lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss P 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  But certain factors might point to the fact that Provident should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include: where a customers income is particularly low; where the repayments are 
particularly high; and/or where the frequency of the loans and the length of time over which a 
customer has been given loans need to be looked at: repeated refinancing could signal that 
the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable.
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Provident was required to establish whether Miss P could sustainably repay her loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the Office of Fair Trading Irresponsible Lending Guide (ILG) (superseded by the 
Financial Conduct Authoritys Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC)) defined sustainable 
as being the ability to repay without undue difficulties.
 
In particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments, and without having to borrow to meet the repayments. And it 
follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower will not be able to make their repayments sustainably if they need to borrow further 
in order to do that.
Miss Ps lending covers many years and so in the earlier months and years the ILG will have 
been applicable. In the later years CONC would have applied. 
And I am aware that Providents representative has, in at least two emails to Miss P, referred 
to Providents willingness to concede on Loans 6 to 16. As Providents final response letter 
had clearly referred to and listed 16 loans then I think that the offer to accept irresponsible 
lending on each of Loans 6 to 16 was clear and unequivocal. In those circumstances 
I consider that there is no dispute in relation to Loans 6 to 16 and I say no more about the 
merits of those applications and approvals apart from the section on redress due to Miss P. 
So, I am addressing Loans 1 to 5 which seem to be the ones where the complaint is 
disputed. Because the two firms  Greenwoods and Provident - were part of the same group 
in those years, I think that Provident would've known about any loans sold by Greenwood, 
and vice versa - so I do consider Loans 1 to 5 as part of one chain. 
I have little information about what Provident or Greenwoods knew about Miss Ps income 
and outgoings at the time of lending Miss P Loans 1 to 5. But what I do know from the 
customer details I have been sent by Provident (for both sets of loans) is that she was 
unemployed. 
Miss P has said that the agent considered her partners income and yet I have nothing from 
Miss P to show me what the financial situation for her was in those six months from 
November 2009 to June 2010. Miss P has had several opportunities to send in more details, 
including notification that the complaints were being passed to an ombudsman and that if 
she had anything else to send or say that it was her opportunity to do so. 
Although I do think that Provident and Greenwoods ought to have carried out more checks 
than it did, because she declared that she was unemployed, I have little from Miss P to 
establish what it would have seen if it had done that. So, I am not able to uphold Miss Ps complaint about Loans 1 to 5. 
I understand from emails from Miss P that one of the reasons she was not content to accept 
any offer from Provident was that she is expecting that some of the principal sums still owing 
ought to be written off. First, as Provident has told us that several of the loans were sold to 
third parties then Provident is not the legal owner of those debts and so it is not able to write 
off the debts and I am not able to direct a third party. 
Secondly, if Provident buys back the debts then I have not been given enough reason by 
Miss P to direct that any of those sums are written off. It is not usual for the ombudsman 
service to expect that principal amounts lent to consumers are written off: having had the 
benefit of that money its only right that the principal sums are repaid. 
Miss P has said that Provident did it for her partner. But here I am considering Miss Ps 
complaint, and what Provident may have chosen to do for another person is a matter for that 
firm.
So, I do not uphold that part of Miss Ps complaint. 
Putting things right
In order to bring the complaints to a conclusion, then the redress for Loans 6 to 16 need to 
be clear and carried out by Provident for both complaints. Provident needs to:
refund all interest and charges Miss P paid on loans 6 to 16;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
the number of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. And Provident was content to remove all entries about loans 
6 to 16 and so they should be removed from Miss Ps credit file.
Provident is entitled to set off any monies arising from the redress against any monies 
Miss P may owe it, but to be clear this should only be in respect of the principal sum 
borrowed. Any unpaid charges and interest would need to be removed first and any 
payments made to either loan treated as if Miss P had paid down the principal.
If a third party owns some of the debts  as Provident says it does in this case - then in order 
to do the set off I have outlined above, Provident will need to repurchase that debt. If it does 
not do that then it cannot do the set off and the full amount due will be repayable to Miss P 
directly. Payments made to that third party will need to be accounted for when working out 
the redress.
And in those circumstances the third party will need to be directed by Provident to correct 
any adverse entries on Miss Ps credit file, so far as it is able to do so. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Provident to take off tax from this interest. It must give 
Miss P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. Any tax is to be 
removed before any set-off.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part and direct that Greenwoods Personal 
Credit Limited, part of Provident Financial Group, does as I have outlined above. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 August 2020.
