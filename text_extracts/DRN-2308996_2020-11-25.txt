The complaint
Mr L complains on behalf of his business F, that PayPal reversed a payment he received 
when selling an item via an online website. Hed like this money returned. 
What happened
Mr L has an account with PayPal. 
In March 2020 Mr L agreed to sell a fireplace via a merchant Ill call E, trading as a business 
Ill call F. He advertised the item as collection only. A buyer purchased the item and paid 
Mr Ls PayPal account £1,500 but explained that he couldnt collect the item, and Mr L 
agreed to deliver it. Unfortunately due to the Coronavirus pandemic and the Lockdown which 
came into force in late March 2020 Mr L was unable to deliver the item. 
Mr Ls buyer put in a claim to PayPal for item not received and PayPal upheld this claim and 
returned the funds to Mr Ls buyer, putting Mr Ls PayPal account in deficit. Mr L explained 
that because his PayPal account had been debited hes had problems paying his rent. And 
he wanted PayPal to review their decision. 
PayPal didnt uphold Mr Ls complaint. They explained that theyd applied both their buyer 
and seller protection policies fairly. And as Mr L still had the fireplace he hadnt delivered the 
item as agreed, therefore the buyer was entitled to a refund. 
Mr L didnt accept PayPals conclusion. So complained to our service. 
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ls complaint, but didnt recommend PayPal needed 
to do anything further. He agreed that PayPal had fairly applied their policies. 
Mr L responded to our investigators opinion by saying in summary:
- The buyer broke his contract with him, when he bought the item it was listed as 
collection only. 
- Mr L still has the item ready for collection.
- He was initially told by PayPal there was no right to appeal the decision, but then he 
was later told he could. 
As Mr L didnt accept our investigators conclusion its been passed to me for a decision. 
On reviewing the case I contacted Mr L to explain I thought that PayPal had acted fairly but 
Mr L didnt accept my conclusion. In response he reiterated the points hed previously raised. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so Ive reached the same conclusion as our investigator and for broadly the 
same reasons. Ill explain why below. 
My role here, as our investigator has outlined, is to look at PayPals action as an FCA 
regulated business. And not the actions of Mr Ls buyer. Therefore I need to consider 
whether I think PayPal have applied their buyer and seller policies fairly. And I wont be 
reaching any conclusions on the actions of Mr Ls buyer.  
Ive seen a copy of both PayPals buyer and seller protection policies. The buyer submitted a 
claim saying that the fireplace wasnt received. And on this basis his money was refunded. 
Mr L accepts that due to the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic the item 
wasn't delivered therefore the buyer's claim was successful. Unfortunately Mr Ls also not 
met the eligibility criteria for PayPals seller protection policy  this is because the 
item wasn't shipped to the buyer's address. I fully appreciate why this didn't happen and in 
fact never would have happened because item was listed as collection only. But it isnt for 
me to question PayPals policies. I realise this will be disappointing to Mr L but sellers are 
only eligible for PayPal seller protection when an item is posted to the shipping address 
registered for the buyer  and not for collection only items. For this reason I can't say PayPal 
didn't apply the terms of their policies fairly, and therefore I'm unable to ask them to refund 
the £1,500 to Mr L. 
I understand that Mr Ls very frustrated with the situation hes found himself in - but for the 
reasons I've explained I cant say that PayPal have acted unfairly here.
My final decision
My final decision is I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 December 2020.
