The complaint
Mr G complains that NewDay Ltd closed his branded credit card account without any notice. 
He said that affected his credit rating, as he was now using a much higher proportion of his 
available credit. He wanted NewDay to pay compensation.
What happened
Mr G told us he held a retailer branded credit card with NewDay. NewDay was ending its 
partnership with that retailer, so he said it wrote to tell him the branding on the card would 
change. But he didnt get a new card. Mr G said when he asked NewDay about that, it said it 
had closed his card, and told him it had written to him. Mr G understood it had only written 
through the retailers own app, which hed never had. 
Mr G said his credit score had gone down, because his overall credit utilisation increased 
when this card was closed. So he said hed missed out on better lending rates as a result. 
Mr G wanted an apology, and for NewDay to pay him compensation, as a goodwill gesture.
NewDay didnt think it made a mistake. It said Mr Gs retailer branded card was dormant, he 
hadnt been using it. So when NewDay ended its partnership with the retailer, it also decided 
to close Mr Gs account. 
NewDay said it was entitled to close the account as long as it gave Mr G the required notice, 
and it said it had written to him to do so. NewDay said it also followed up that letter with SMS 
messages to Mr G, reminding him the account was going to close. 
Our investigator didnt think this complaint should be upheld. He said NewDay is entitled to 
close Mr Gs account with notice, and NewDay had given Mr G almost three months of 
notice in writing. It wasnt NewDays fault if Mr G didnt get that letter. And it had shown us it 
sent him SMS reminders. 
Mr G asked to see the closure letter, and the terms of the account, so our investigator sent 
these to him. But Mr G said NewDay didnt send that letter to his home, it sent it through the 
retailer app, which hed never had. Our investigator said it was sent by post, to Mr Gs home 
address. Mr G looked again at the letter our investigator sent, and then said he thought 
NewDay was only telling him the account would change branding, not that it would close. 
Our investigator said he could see why Mr G thought that, having reread the letter. But he 
didnt think things would have been different if the letter had been clearer. NewDay had 
already decided to close Mr Gs account, and that decision wasnt likely to change. So our 
investigator thought that NewDays apology provided a fair outcome here.
Because Mr G didnt agree, this case was passed to me for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can see that Mr G wanted a little more time to make submissions to our service on this 
case, as hed made a subject access request to NewDay. But Mr G asked for that extension 
of time in early July. Our service hasnt heard from him again since then. And I do think I 
have sufficient information to fairly decide this case. So Ill now set out that decision.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator. Like him, I do 
think that NewDays letter to Mr G, telling him the account was closing, could have been 
clearer. But overall, I do think NewDay had told Mr G his account was closing, and that the 
administration of the account would be handled differently from 11 November onwards. The 
letter said this  
As of 11th November 2022 your Amazon Platinum Mastercard account will 
close. After this date, you will not be able to make any further purchases on your 
card.
The text in bold above, appears in bold on the original letter.
Theres then quite a lot more text in that letter, explaining what happens to the account after 
this. I think NewDay was trying to explain to Mr G here that there would be different 
arrangements going forward, with a new name on the account, until it was paid off. I have 
read this, and I do quite understand why Mr G says this wasnt clear. 
But I also have to bear in mind that Amazon did set out, in bold text, that Mr Gs account was 
closing. And I cant see anywhere in the letter that it mentions issuing him with a new card. It 
just says its going to close the account, and Mr G wont be able to use the card for 
purchases any more. 
NewDay says that as well as this letter, it also sent Mr G a series of SMS messages to 
remind him this account would close. Im satisfied that the terms of Mr Gs account with 
NewDay allowed it to close the account with two months notice, and that NewDay gave Mr 
G the required notice. Its not clear if Mr G did get this letter or not. His original complaint 
refers to having been told he didnt need to do anything, which seems to me likely to be a 
reference to this letter. But I do think that both a letter and some SMS reminders were sent 
to him, so even if Mr G didnt see these, thats not NewDays fault. 
Mr G said the closure of this account affected his credit score. Our investigator has 
explained that a credit score is an assessment of someones overall credit file position, done 
by a credit reference agency. When lenders decide whether to offer someone lending, they 
dont usually just look at that score, they usually do their own assessment of whether to lend, 
based on the credit file itself. So a change in Mr Gs credit score doesnt necessarily mean 
lenders wont offer him lending. 
And, unfortunately, NewDay did have the right to end this agreement with Mr G, in the way 
set out in his terms. And its followed those terms. So even if this change did mean Mr G 
couldnt now get the best deals on credit elsewhere, I wouldnt say that meant NewDay had 
to reopen the card for him, or to pay him compensation. 
I know that Mr G will be disappointed, but, like our investigator, I also think that an apology 
for the fact that its letter could have been clearer, is all that NewDay needs to do in this case. 
So, although Mr G will be disappointed, I dont think his complaint should be upheld. My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 December 2023.
