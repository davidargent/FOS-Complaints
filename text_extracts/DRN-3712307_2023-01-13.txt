The complaint
Mr and Mrs B complain that Barclays Bank UK PLC (Barclays) has refused to refund them 
the amount they lost as the result of a scam.
As Mr B had most of the dealings with the scammers and Barclays for ease of reading, Ill 
refer to him alone through this decision. 
What happened
Mr B were looking to invest some of their money and found an advertisement online for the 
business 23 Traders. 23 Traders claimed to be specialists in binary options and as this was 
of interest to Mr B he completed a contact form.
23 Traders contacted Mr B by telephone and built confidence with him. Mr B was convinced 
to transfer funds from other sources before transferring funds from his Barclays bank 
account. The investments that were made appeared legitimate. Mr B was then convinced by 
23 Traders that investing more would maximise his potential profit.
Mr B sent a total of £53,100 to 23 Traders from his Barclays current account (using his Visa 
debit card) between 3  10 January 2017 as set out below: 
1. 3 January 2017 - £250
2. 3 January 2017 - £4,750
3. 3 January 2017 - £5,000
4. 3 January 2017 - £5,000
5. 10 January 2017 - £4,100
6. 10 January 2017 - £4,000
7. 10 January 2017 - £5,000
8. 10 January 2017 - £5,000
9. 10 January 2017 - £5,000
10. 10 January 2017 - £5,000
11. 10 January 2017 - £5,000
12. 10 January 2017 - £5,000
The 23 Traders website was then shut down and it stopped replying to Mr Bs emails.
Our Investigator considered Mr Bs complaint and thought it should be upheld. She thought 
the third payment to 23 Traders of £5,000 made on 3 January 2017 (the second large 
payment that day) should have been significant enough to trigger Barclays fraud prevention 
measures, and it should have stepped in at this stage to ask questions about the payments.
Our Investigator felt that had Barclays stepped in at this time and asked relevant questions it 
was likely Barclays would have been able to see the payments were most likely part of a 
scam and prevented any further loss.
Barclays disagreed so this complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The circumstances of this complaint are not in dispute and the evidence provided by both 
Mr B and Barclays set out what happened well. What is in dispute is whether Barclays 
should refund any of the money Mr B lost because of the scam.
Mr B has accepted he authorised the payments he made to 23 Traders, so the starting point 
here is that Mr B is responsible. However, banks and other Payment Services Providers 
(PSPs) do have a duty to protect against the risk of financial loss due to fraud and/or to 
undertake due diligence on large transactions to guard against money laundering.
Having looked over Mr Bs bank statements for the 12 months prior to the payments made to 
23 Traders I can see that the account balance was kept relatively low with no payments over 
£1,000 being made. Except for one large payment of over £100,000 being in August 2016.
On 3 January 2017 Mr B made several consecutive payments to 23 Traders, a business he 
had not made any payments to before. The first payment was for a low amount of £250 
which was not too dissimilar to other payments usually made from this account, so I think it 
was reasonable that this payment was processed without any intervention by Barclays.
The second payment Mr B made from this account was for a much higher amount of £4,750 
to 23 Traders. While this was to a business Mr B hadnt made payments to before this day, 
at this point it was one singular larger payment and I dont think it would be reasonable for 
me to suggest that Barclays needs step in and stop all larger payments made by its 
customers. In any event this payment wasnt of such a significant value that I think it would 
reasonably trigger Barclays fraud prevention systems by itself.
The third payment on the same say was for £5,000 this is a significant value not in keeping 
with the way Mr B previously used their account. It was also the third payment made that day 
and was becoming an unusual pattern of payments. This payment brought their total 
payments that day to £10,000 which was also out of keeping with the usual running of the 
account.
I think this series of payments should have been sufficient for Barclays to have intervened to 
check that all was well. At this stage Barclays should have stepped in and asked Mr B in 
depth questions to find out what the payments related to.
If Barclays had stepped in, I think its likely Mr B would have explained the reason they were 
making the payments. Barclays would have likely warned them about the high risk of binary 
option investments and the types of scams they have seen, which I think would have been 
like that Mr B weas experiencing at the time. I note 23 Traders were operating without being 
licensed by the UKs Gambling Commission (as required at the material time) and they 
appeared to be pressuring Mr B to pay larger sums quickly. With the information Barclays 
ought to have known about binary options scams at the time, I think these would have been 
key red flags and they would have likely explained their concerns that this was likely a scam. 
With this explanation I think its likely Mr B wouldnt have made any further payments and 
further loses would have been prevented.
In addition to the expectations on Barclays to have effective fraud prevention systems in 
place its expected that customers should take responsibility for their decisions. In the 
circumstances I dont think it would be fair to say Mr B contributed to the loss. I say this because Mr B had no previous experience in this type of investment and were lulled into a 
false sense of security by a business that went to great lengths to appear to be legitimate.
So, I dont think it would be fair to reduce compensation on the basis that Mr B should share 
blame for what happened.
I think Barclays is responsible for the loss Mr and Mrs B incurred after the £4,750 payment 
made on 3 January 2017 and should refund Mr and Mrs B all the amounts, they paid 23 
Traders after this payment was made.
Putting things right
Barclays Bank UK PLC should refund all the payments Mr B made as part of the scam after 
the first payment of £4,750 was processed on 3 January 2017 as I think all additional losses 
should have been prevented by Barclays Bank UK PLC stepping in.
Barclays Bank UK PLC should add 8% simple interest per year to the amount it pays Mr and 
Mrs B from the time Mr B made the payments to the time Barclays Bank UK PLC provides 
the refund (less any lawfully deductible tax).
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and require Barclays Bank UK PLC to refund Mr and Mrs B as set out 
above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs B to 
accept or reject my decision before 10 February 2023.
