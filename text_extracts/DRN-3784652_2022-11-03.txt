The complaint 
Mr B complains that Mitsubishi HC Capital UK plc, trading as Hitachi Capital, has rejected 
the claims that hes made under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Hes being represented in 
his complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in October 2022 in which I described what 
had happened as follows:
Mr B and his wife entered into a trial membership agreement in November 2010 for 
the right to reserve five holiday weeks within the following three years with a 
timeshare company. The price of the trial membership was £3,995 and Mr B entered 
into a fixed sum loan agreement with Hitachi Capital for £3,000 which he agreed to 
repay by 24 monthly instalments of £148.47.
Mr B and his wife entered into an acquisition agreement to buy some holiday club 
membership points from the timeshare company in December 2011. They traded in 
their trial membership and agreed to pay an additional £9,334. Mr B entered into a 
fixed sum loan agreement with Hitachi Capital for that amount and he agreed to 
make 180 monthly payments of £146.55.
Mr Bs representative complained to Hitachi Capital in January 2018 under sections 
75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act. It complained about a number of issues 
including that the membership had been sold as an investment and had been 
misrepresented and mis-sold to Mr B and his wife, and that there was an unfair 
relationship between Hitachi Capital and Mr B. It also asked for information about the 
commission that was paid by Hitachi Capital to the timeshare company.
Hitachi Capital sent a detailed response to that complaint in which it set out the 
reasons that it didnt believe that the evidential threshold for these types of claims 
had been met. Mr B wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to 
this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She didnt 
think that the memberships had been misrepresented to Mr B and his wife or that 
Hitachi Capital had acted unfairly when it decided not to uphold his claim under 
section 75. She thought that it was unlikely that a court would find that there was an 
unfair relationship between Hitachi Capital and Mr B and she said that she hadnt 
seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for him.
Mr Bs representative, on his behalf, says that it wants this complaint to be referred to 
an ombudsman and that a full substantive response would follow in due course upon 
receipt of instructions from Mr B  but no further response has been received.
I set out in my provisional decision the reasons that I didnt consider that Mr Bs complaint 
should be upheld which were:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and our 
rules, which we are required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that we 
cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years after the 
event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on which the 
complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) that they 
had cause for complaint;
Mr Bs complaint is that Hitachi Capital turned down the claims that hed made under 
sections 75 and 140A and I accept that his complaint was referred to this service 
within six years of that happening - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 
applies to his claims;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr Bs section 75 and section 140A claims in this 
decision as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Hitachi Capitals response to those claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met);
Mr Bs claim under section 75 is that the memberships were misrepresented to him 
and his wife and that they wouldnt have bought them if they hadnt been 
misrepresented to them - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 were met, Hitachi 
Capital would be expected to consider that claim unless the claim was brought 
outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act in which case the claim would 
be time-barred;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or section 9 of 
the Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr B could have made a claim to the timeshare company or Hitachi 
Capital about the misrepresentations that he say induced him and his wife into 
buying the memberships soon after they entered into the acquisition agreement in 
December 2011 as that was the latest time that any misrepresentations would have 
been made and any loss would have been incurred as that was when he also 
entered into the loan agreement for £9,334 with Hitachi Capital;that loan agreement shows a date in December 2012 next to Mr Bs signature but the 
acquisition agreement was dated in December 2011, the payment was due by a 
specified date in December 2011 and the membership certificate that was issued to 
Mr B and his wife was dated in January 2012  so I consider it to be more likely than 
not that Mr B signed the loan agreement in December 2011 and that it was dated in 
error as December 2012 rather than December 2011;
I consider that Mr Bs cause of action accrued in December 2011, so he would have 
had six years from then to bring a claim against either the timeshare company or 
Hitachi Capital  but a claim wasnt made under section 75 until January 2018, more 
than six years later which was outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation Act 
so I consider that his claim under section 75 is now time-barred;
Mr Bs representative says that Mr B only became aware that he could make a claim 
to Hitachi Capital at a later date - but when he had the knowledge to bring a claim 
doesnt assist him for the purposes of the Limitation Act  the time limits for a claim 
under some sections of that Act are extended where a claimant doesnt have 
knowledge at the time when the cause of action accrued, but I dont consider that 
those sections are applicable to Mr Bs claim;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim under 
section 140A is six years;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr Bs loan agreement ended more than six years 
before he complained to Hitachi Capital so I consider that Hitachi Capital was right to 
consider Mr Bs claim under section 140A but I consider it to be unlikely that a court 
would find that the relationship between Hitachi Capital and Mr B was unfair in these 
circumstances;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr B was sold the 
memberships as an investment  the trial membership agreement gave Mr B the 
right to reserve five holiday weeks within the following three years with the timeshare 
company and he bought some holiday club membership points from the timeshare 
company under the acquisition agreement and I dont consider that either agreement 
would reasonably be considered to be an investment;
Mr Bs representative has asked about the commission that Hitachi Capital paid to 
the timeshare company for arranging the loans  but Ive not been provided with any 
evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid by it to the timeshare company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Hitachi Capital wouldnt 
have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it under any 
regulatory duty to disclose the amount of commission paid in these circumstances - 
and I dont consider that the level of commission that was normally paid in this type of 
situation was sufficiently high to mean that Hitachi Capital should have appreciated 
that not disclosing any commission to Mr B risked the relationship being unfair under 
section 140A;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr B was unduly 
pressured into buying the memberships or entering into the loan agreements or that 
the timeshare company used unacceptable commercial practices against him  he 
didnt complain to Hitachi Capital about those issues until January 2018  more than 
six years after he entered into the acquisition agreement and I consider that it would 
be reasonable to expect him to have complained to Hitachi Capital about any such 
issues before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of any laws or regulations for which Hitachi Capital would be liable in these 
circumstances;
Hitachi Capital issued a substantive response to Mr Bs claims in March 2018  
although I consider that it should have said that his claim under section 75 was time-
barred, I consider that it was fair and reasonable for it to say that there wasnt 
enough evidence to support his claims; and
I sympathise with Mr B for the issues that he and his wife have had with their 
memberships and the difficulties that theyve experienced, but I find that it wouldnt 
be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Hitachi Capital to 
refund to Mr B any of the money that hes paid under the loan agreements, to pay 
him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
Subject to any further representations by Mr B, his representative or Hitachi Capital, my 
provisional decision was that I didnt intend to uphold this complaint. Both Mr Bs 
representative and Hitachi Capital have confirmed that theyve received my provisional 
decision but Ive not received any other comments on it.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As none of Mr B, his representative and Hitachi Capital has made any comments on my 
provisional decision, I see no reason to change the findings that I set out in my provisional 
decision. I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Hitachi Capital to refund to Mr B any of the money that hes paid under the loan agreements, 
to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Bs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 December 2022.
