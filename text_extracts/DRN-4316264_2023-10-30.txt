The complaint
Mr B complains about National Westminster Bank Plcs (NatWest) handling of a fraud claim 
on his account.
What happened
In March and April 2023, three debit card payments were made from his account to a 
company Ill refer to as G. These payments were for £200, £122.30 and £94.89. Mr B didnt 
authorise or make these payments and reported them to NatWest as fraudulent.
As a result, NatWest refunded Mr B for all three of the fraudulent transactions, but they 
accidentally refunded him twice for the first payment. This meant Mr B received an additional 
£200 credit to his account.
Mr B wasnt happy with NatWests handling of his fraud claims and raised a complaint. In 
response, NatWest apologised for the poor level of service Mr B had received and agreed to 
not take back the additional £200 hed been paid in error. They also made a further payment 
of £100 compensation for the distress Mr B had experienced.
Mr B wasnt happy with NatWests response, so he brought a complaint to our service.
As part of his complaint, Mr B raised the following concerns:
He found it difficult to report the fraudulent transactions to NatWest and had to chase 
them to get updates. Also, he didnt receive an acknowledgement after hed 
completed the online retail dispute forms.
NatWest should have a fraud team available 24/7, its not acceptable for customers 
to not be able to talk to the fraud team when the fraud happens.
NatWest shouldve prevented the second and third payments from being taken by G, 
when they cancelled his debit card after the first payment was reported. He doesnt 
understand how they allowed two further payments to be taken from his account.
NatWest told him to call G but didnt provide him with any contact information. G is a 
major company who doesnt have a phone number, so he couldnt call them to report 
the fraud as NatWest suggested.
He was left with only a few pounds in his account as a result of the fraudulent 
transactions and was unable to pay bills or buy food for three days. But NatWest 
didnt do anything to help him, and he had to rely on friends and family which was 
embarrassing. 
Multiple calls he had with NatWest were disconnected and resulted in him having to 
call back. 
All of the fraudulent transactions shouldve been flagged by NatWest and not allowed 
to go through in the first place, as he hadnt made any genuine payments to G since 
2017.
NatWest made numerous mistakes and errors, including making several debits and 
credits to his account in relation to the first fraudulent transaction he reported. This 
was confusing. 
He was already struggling with poor mental and physical health which NatWest were 
aware of, and NatWests errors and mistakes added to the stress he was already 
facing.
An investigator looked into Mr Bs complaint and didnt uphold it, saying that the £300 Mr B 
had already received was fair for the poor service hed received.
Mr B asked for his complaint to be reviewed by an ombudsman, raising the following points:
The investigator had highlighted some serious failures by NatWest and their handling 
of the situation but felt the £300 was fair  Mr B disagreed.
Mr B was already struggling with his mental health and this whole ordeal set back his 
recovery and added to the stress he was already facing.
NatWest failed to protect Mr Bs money or his well-being.
The payments shouldve been flagged by NatWest and not allowed to go through in 
the first place.
Its not clear why NatWest failed to stop/block further transactions by G, after he was 
told they would be blocked.
While he had benefited from the additional £200 that was paid to his account, this 
wasnt something he wanted or intended. He just expected NatWest to handle his 
fraud case with more consideration to the facts and in a more swift and efficient way.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered all of the points that Mr B has raised, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as the investigator and wont be asking NatWest to pay Mr B anything further. Ill 
explain why.
Mr B is unhappy with the availability of NatWests fraud team and their process for 
customers wanting to raise fraud claims. Our service is unable to comment on or make 
recommendations to businesses around their processes, operations or procedures. This falls 
within the remit of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), not our service. However, I can 
consider the impact that they may have on a customer.
In this case, Mr B wanted to raise his fraud claim by talking to NatWests fraud team, but 
they werent available when he called. So, Mr B was asked to complete an online form which 
is used for retail disputes, which is what his claim related to. I appreciate that this wasnt the 
way Mr B wanted to report the fraud, however he wasnt prevented from making the claim 
and the completed form was sent to the relevant fraud team for investigation. 
Mr B is concerned that despite cancelling his debit card after the first fraudulent transaction, 
G was able to take another two payments. In their response to Mr B, NatWest explained that 
Mastercard and Visa offer a service where they provide certain retailers with up-to-date card 
details  to ensure no disruption to subscriptions or monthly payments. This is a facility put in 
place by Mastercard and Visa, not by NatWest. So, while NatWest had cancelled Mr Bs debit card after the first payment, the new card details were given to G under the 
Mastercard/Visa arrangement which enabled G to take a further two payments. In order to 
prevent this NatWest told Mr B to contact G so that they could cancel the 
subscription/agreement and prevent further payments being taken. 
I understand Mr Bs frustration to not be given a phone number for G, as they are a large 
company with a predominantly online presence. So, Mr B couldnt find a phone number 
online to report the fraud which was frustrating. However, NatWest dont have a contact 
phone number for G, and I cant fairly say that they were required to have one or provide one 
to Mr B  although I appreciate that it wouldve been helpful. From what Ive seen, NatWest 
took the appropriate steps on being notified of the fraud by cancelling Mr Bs card and 
recommending that he contact G. 
Mr B feels that NatWest shouldnt have allowed the transactions to G to go through in the 
first place, highlighting that he hadnt made a payment to G in a number of years. However, 
based on the size of the payments, I wouldnt have expected NatWest to have flagged them 
as suspicious or to have prevented them from going through. A balance has to be struck 
between NatWest identifying potentially concerning payments and minimising disruption to 
legitimate payments. The fact that Mr B hadnt made a payment to G for a significant period 
of time, by itself, isnt enough to put NatWest on notice that the payments taken from Mr Bs 
account mayve been fraudulent. So I cant agree that NatWest shouldve been concerned or 
blocked the payments when they were made.
NatWest has accepted that they made some mistakes, and that Mr B didnt receive the level 
of service that he shouldve. I can see that they incorrectly raised a second fraud claim in 
relation to the first payment Mr B made. Ultimately, there ended up being seven payments 
(debits and credits) made to Mr Bs account for £200, which resulted in him being refunded 
an additional £200 in error. NatWest have also agreed that several calls Mr B made to them 
were disconnected in error. 
Having listened to the calls Mr B had with NatWest, I think NatWest shouldve been more 
responsive to Mr B when he told them of his short-term financial difficulty due to the 
fraudulent transactions leaving his account. I cant see that they offered any possible 
solutions or sign posted him to any charities or organisations that mightve been able to help. 
Overall, I agree that NatWest has made some mistakes and that Mr B didnt receive the level 
of customer service that he shouldve from NatWest.
Im sorry to hear about the poor health Mr B has experienced, and the impact the fraudulent 
transactions had on his health. I accept that the mistakes made by NatWest added to the 
distress Mr B experienced as a victim of fraud, however the awards we make are modest 
and I cant make an award against NatWest for the distress caused by someone fraudulently 
taking money from Mr Bs account. 
NatWest left the additional refund of £200 in Mr Bs account and paid him another £100 in 
compensation. So, in total hes received £300 compensation. Having carefully considered 
everything Mr B has told us, Im satisfied that the £300 already paid by NatWest is in line 
with what I wouldve recommended they pay in these circumstances. I realise that Mr B 
received the additional £200 credit due to NatWest accidentally over crediting his account, 
but they were entitled to ask for that money to be returned, so its only fair that I take that into 
consideration when deciding the overall award. On that basis, I wont be asking NatWest to 
pay Mr B anything further.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint against National Westminster Bank Plc.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 November 2023.
