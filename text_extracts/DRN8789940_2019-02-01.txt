K820x#14complaint
Mr B complains that CURO TRANSATLANTIC LIMITED (trading as WageDayAdvance)  
placed a default on his account without notification.
background
Mr B borrowed £600 from WageDayAdvance on 29 December 2016. It was due to be repaid 
in four instalments of just under £247, with the final instalment due on 27 April 2017.
WageDayAdvance says it was notified about  Mr Bs financial difficulty  by a debt 
management charity on 10 January 2017.  It says that, as a result, no further interest or 
charges were added  to the loan and a repayment  plan was agreed at £47.56 per month. 
WageDayAdvance says it received the agreed  payments in February, March and April 2017, 
with a further £12.96 on 16 June 2017,  but that no further payments have been received.
WageDayAdvance acknowledges Mr B offered a new monthly repayment of £80 and says it 
requested information  about his income and expenditure on 5 and 12 September 2017. It 
says it did not receive the requested information until 29 November 2017, but that a new 
repayment plan was agreed at £50 per month. However, it says no payments were received.
In the meantime, WageDayAdvance says it sent Mr B a default  notice on 11 September  
2017 advising him a default may be registered if no payments were received. So, it says, it 
could not agree the default  was registered  incorrectly and advised Mr B to contact the debt 
collection agency that was now dealing with the account to discuss a repayment solution.
Mr B says he sent the income and expenditure  information, along with a monthly repayment 
offer of £80, to WageDayAdvance on 29 August 2017, and again  a few days  later. He says 
that when he received  no response to his offer, he sent further information on 29 November  
2017, and offered to repay  £50 per month. He says that by the time WageDayAdvance 
agreed to the £50 offer, a default  had already been  applied to his account.
Our adjudicator did not recommend the complaint should be upheld. She acknowledged 
WageDayAdvance couldve set up a repayment  plan sooner, but she also considered what 
was likely to have happened had it done so. She said that, as Mr B hadnt made payments 
since the plan was set up, she thought  it likely that would  have  been  the case even if it been 
set up earlier. So she found  it likely  WageDayAdvance would still have recorded a default.
Mr B responded to say, in summary, that the reason he made no payments when the 
repayment plan was finally set up was because  the default had already been placed on his 
account at that stage.  He clarified  that he never  received  a default letter and that the debt 
was fully repaid  in 2018 when he was contacted by the debt collection agency.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im satisfied Mr B made no payments  after 16 June  2017, until he repaid it in 2018.  So, I 
dont find it unreasonable for WageDayAdvance to have sent a default notice when it did. I 
acknowledge Mr B says he didnt receive it, but Ive seen records  that show it was sent on 
11 September 2017 and WageDayAdvance confirmed it was sent to the right address.
Ref: DRN87899402I now need to consider  whether I find WageDayAdvance acted correctly when it registered 
the default on Mr Bs credit file on 11 October  2017.
WageDayAdvance emailed Mr B on 29 August 2017 and offered a 10% reduction on the 
total owed. It also said that if he couldnt repay  that amount within  30 days,  then it would 
consider a repayment plan for the full balance, subject to Mr B providing  his income and 
expenditure.
I have seen a copy of the email that Mr B says he responded  with the same day, and re-sent 
on 2 September  2017. In it he offers to repay the full amount at £80 per month and has 
completed the requested information. WageDayAdvance says it didnt receive such  an 
email, but has acknowledged it received the £80 per month offer.  As a result,  on 6 
September 2017, WageDayAdvance sent Mr B another email requesting information about 
his income and expenditure, and asking  for bank statements.
Again, Mr B responded  within a day and explained that he had already sent the requested  
information, but that bank statements werent  originally requested. WageDayAdvance 
repeated its request for information on 12 Sep 2017.
As Mr B had heard nothing further, he finally contacted WageDayAdvance again on 29 
November 2017  and this time offered to pay £50 per month.  This payment plan was then set 
up but, after two failed attempts to take the first payment due in December 2017, 
WageDayAdvance passed  the account  to a third party debt collection agency.
When the evidence  is incomplete, or contradictory,  as some of it is here, I must make  my 
decision based on the balance of probability   that is, what  I consider is most likely  to have 
happened.
Based on the evidence  I have seen, I find it likely that WageDayAdvance received Mr Bs 
email with the £80 repayment offer, but overlooked the income and expenditure figures he 
provided at the same  time (they were  included within the body of WageDayAdvances email, 
rather than within Mr Bs response). So I accept WageDayAdvance could  have set up a 
repayment plan earlier than it did.
But I also think it more likely than not that Mr B received the default notice and, therefore, 
would have known  the consequences  for a further period of non-payment. The lack of a 
repayment plan did not preclude  Mr B from making repayments.
Indeed, even when WageDayAdvance  set up the £50 repayment plan in December  2017,  Mr 
B failed  to make his first repayment. I accept he says that was because he knew  about  the 
default by then, but WageDayAdvances records show  two repayment attempts failed due to 
the card payment being declined.
Ive also considered what is likely to have happened  had WageDayAdvance set up a 
repayment plan in September 2017. Given  that Mr B failed to make any £50 repayments  in 
December 2017,  I find it unlikely that he would  have been able to sustain higher monthly 
repayments of £80. So I consider it likely  that the agreement would have broken down and 
WageDayAdvance would still have applied a default to Mr Bs account. Indeed, had that 
have been the case, Mr B would have  been  in a worse  situation, as the default would have 
taken longer to clear  his credit file. 
Ref: DRN87899403In conclusion, I cant agree that WageDayAdvance was wrong  to apply the default  to Mr Bs 
account. Im satisfied that the default  notice was sent, and that no payments were made 
within the notice  period.
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019.
