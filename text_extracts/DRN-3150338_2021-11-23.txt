The complaint
Mr J complains that PayPal (Europe) S.a.r.l. et Cie S.C.A (PayPal) rejected his claim under 
its buyer protection policy. He would like his claim for  a refund upheld.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I agree with the conclusion reached by our investigator for the following 
reasons :-
Its always difficult for a consumer to prove they didnt get an item they ordered. In 
this case there is a disparity between the recorded delivery weight of the item sent 
(3.5kg) and the weight showed on delivery (5 kg). However, both weights are more 
consistent with that of a PlayStation rather than just a PlayStation controller. I cant 
explain the difference in weights . But they dont prove to me that Mr J got the smaller 
item not the PlayStation he ordered.
PayPals buyer protection policy says it has sole discretion as to whether a claim is 
eligible for a refund or not. I have considered if PayPals refusal to refund the item 
was fair and, in this case, I think it was for the reasons given below.
PayPal has shown us an email it sent to Mr J advising him of concerns with his 
account . It warned that it might need to reconsider his access to the Buyer 
Protection Programmed as a result. I believe this email was sent on or around June 
2020. PayPal has shown us , in confidence, information on Mr Js account after this 
date which resulted in its decision to suspend its Buyer Protection Pprogramme for 
Mr J. This information was shared to us in confidence. I appreciate its frustrating for 
Mr J that I cant as  a result I cant share this in detail with him. But from what I have 
seen I think PayPal made a reasonable decision to suspend its Buyer Protection 
Programme. And as a result, I dont think it was unreasonable for it not to refund the 
claim Mr J made in September 2021.
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 December 2021.
