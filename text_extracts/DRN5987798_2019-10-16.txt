K822xcomplaint
Mrs E complains on behalf of a limited company (B) for whom  shes  a director. Mrs E is 
represented by Mr E in this complaint  but, for ease, Ill refer to all submissions as being 
made by Mrs E directly.   
Mrs E complains that WorldPay (UK) Limited  took too long to release funds to B. She says B 
suffered substantial financial implications because of that, and she wants  
WorldPay (UK) Limited to increase the amount  of compensation its said itll pay.
background 
B is a family run restaurant  and used WorldPay (UK) Limited (hereafter WorldPay) as its 
merchant acquire  that meant  WorldPay provided  the restaurant  with the facility to accept 
card payments. 
In 2018, Bs accountant made  an error which resulted in the companys status being listed  
as pending strike off. And WorldPay diverted Bs funds into a holding account  because of 
that. B was able to rectify that error and had its status amended though,  so WorldPay agreed 
to release its funds.  WorldPay said itd take seven to ten working days  for that release to 
happen. But it didnt  release Bs funds within that timeframe and took an additional two 
weeks to do so. 
Mrs E complained on Bs behalf  and WorldPay accepted  responsibly  for causing the two 
week delay. To recognise the inconvenience that its delay may have caused, WorldPay  
offered B £150 compensation. But Mrs E didnt  think £150 provided  a reasonable resolution 
to Bs complaint and approached this service. 
On Bs behalf, Mrs E said that WorldPay had held on to Bs funds illegally and, despite 
continuous phone calls to and promises from WorldPay, its delay had caused  B to suffer 
substantial financial implications. 
One of our investigators  looked at what had happened and agreed that WorldPay had taken 
two weeks too long to release Bs funds. She upheld Mrs Es complaint and recommended 
WorldPay increased its compensation  offer to £500. WorldPay  agreed  to that 
recommendation, but Mrs E still didnt think £500 accurately reflected the impact on B. So as 
no agreement was reached the complaint was passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Im not persuaded that 
the amount of compensation recommended  by our investigator should be increased.  I realise  
that Mrs E will be further disappointed by that, but let me explain why. 
The diversion of Bs funds  was likely  to have been inconvenient for the restaurant. But as Bs 
merchant acquirer, Im satisfied that WorldPay was acting in line with its obligations when it 
initially diverted  that money. WorldPay has said it normally takes seven to ten working days  
to reverse such action  because doing so involves   registering  a strike off as discontinued, 
ensuring all payments are sent back into it, reconciling its accounts, and sending the 
relevant funds back to the merchant. I think that represents a reasonable explanation as to 
why WorldPay told Mrs E thats how long itd take to release Bs funds. But I accept  
WorldPay didnt go on to release Bs funds until some two weeks after that.
Ref: DRN59877982Mrs E says that during those two weeks  B wasnt able to pay its staff or its suppliers, it had 
to borrow money, its suppliers lost faith in it, and B was no longer able to gain credit. Our 
investigator asked Mrs E whether B was able to provide any information  to support those 
points, and I can see that Mrs E provided  some of Bs bank statements in support of what 
had been said.  Looking at those, I can see that B did have reduced funds during the time in 
question. But Bs statements havent,  in isolation,  corroborated the financial implications that 
have been reported. 
Im aware that Mrs E has said B had no access to its bank  accounts  and many of its 
suppliers accounts  etc. were handled  face to face.  And whilst I appreciate B was a family run 
restaurant and recognise that having  reduced  funds longer than necessary  was likely to 
have caused it prolonged inconvenience, I dont think that the extent of that inconvenience  
has been sufficiently  substantiated. So Im not persuaded that I can fairly say WorldPays 
delay impacted B in the manner thats been described. Thats not to say B wasnt  impacted 
by the two week delay  just that theres not enough  evidence to persuade me that it was 
impacted to the extent being  reported.
I fully understand  why Mrs E wants this service  to take into account  the anxiety and pressure 
that she personally experienced because of WorldPays  delay too. But Mrs E brought  this 
complaint on behalf of B  a limited company  and I must consider the impact that 
WorldPays actions had on B itself. Having said that, I can see that representatives of B were 
in contact with WorldPay  regarding the delayed  funds  and I dont doubt  that Mrs E was likely 
to have been inconvenienced by what had happened.  But the matter I have to decide  in this 
case is whether £500 compensation represents a fair and reasonable resolution to Bs 
complaint. And for the reasons given  above I think it does. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint. WorldPay (UK) Limited should pay £500 
compensation.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs E on behalf  of 
B to accept  or reject  my decision before 16 November 2019.
