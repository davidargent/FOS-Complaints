The complaint
Mrs A complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) have incorrectly applied a
default to her credit rating due to missed payments on her account.
Mrs A is represented, and Ill refer to him as Mr H.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on 11 March 2021outlining my initial thoughts and why I 
wasnt minded to uphold the complaint. I gave a deadline of 25 March for parties to reply and 
in that time Mr H responded. In summary, he disagreed with my decision stating;
- There was no evidence PayPal had posted anything to Mrs A.
- He hadnt finished sending us evidence and was waiting on call received logs from a 
mobile phone provider.
- The notice demand was for £44.28 reflecting three missed months, but payment was 
made in May and PayPal reported to the credit file company that a payment was 
made in time.
- Further time was required to receive call logs on calls received.
The summary of the complaint is as follows;
Mrs A held a PayPal credit account and says she missed two payments. She feels 
she brought the account up to date, so PayPal shouldnt have recorded the account 
in default.
PayPal said that Mrs A had missed three payments in 2019. When they issued a 
default notice, Mrs A made a partial payment. But as the account remained in 
arrears, PayPal continued to default the account.
Mr H raised a complaint to PayPal saying Mrs A hadnt received any default notices, 
and theyd only made a partial payment to keep the account ticking over. Mrs A only 
became aware of the default notice when she checked her credit file.
PayPal didnt provide a response and our investigator considered the information 
available to him. He upheld the complaint and said the relationship between Mrs A 
and PayPal hadnt broken down. And due to the small amount owing, he felt the 
default had been applied too quickly given the circumstances. He recommended that 
the default marker should be removed and replaced by arrears notifications instead.
Mr H agreed with his findings, however PayPal didnt. They said they had a 
responsibility as a lender to provide accurate information as to what was happening 
on the account. As Mrs A hadnt made any attempt to contact them about the debt 
and arrears, they felt the default had been applied fairly.
PayPal disagreed with our investigators findings.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I explained my provisional findings as follows;
PayPal have a duty to fairly and accurately report information about Mrs As 
behaviour on her account with them.
Its not in dispute that Mrs A missed the contractual payments on the account over
three consecutive months (March, April and May 2019) and didnt pay the full arrears 
amount owing.
PayPal provided Mrs A with information in the form of arrears and default notices and 
what was needed to restore the account. PayPal held the correct address for Mrs A, 
and they arent responsible for the post once it enters the postal system.
The default notice was issued on 21 May 2019 and Mrs A made an online payment 
for around a third of the arrears on 30 May 2019 (without making direct contact with 
PayPal). I wouldve expected her to contact PayPal to discuss her situation if she 
couldnt repay the full amount, which was also specified in the default notice.
Even though a partial payment was made, this wouldnt have been enough to stop 
any action that PayPal can take in their capacity as a responsible lender. I havent 
seen that the account was fully brought up to date to include the balance and any 
owing arrears.
In this case Im satisfied its reasonable that PayPal continued with the default for the 
account even though a small partial payment had been made. Theres no set 
threshold of how much a debt must be before further action is taken. The key is that 
several payments had been missed and PayPals notice set out the amount to be 
paid and the date by which to effect payment.
Ive considered recent evidence Mr H has sent of a call lasting around 27 minutes 
with a PayPal telephone number on 4 June 2019. Theres no context about what that 
conversation related to except Mr H says it goes to show the relationship between 
Mrs A and PayPal hadnt irreparably broken down.
The reality though was that Mrs A had prioritised other payments above PayPal but 
made no contact with PayPal about her situation. And its not asserted by Mr H that 
the call of 4 June manifested in an agreement between Mrs A and PayPal to defer 
the default or that an alternative repayment arrangement had been made.
Having thought carefully about everything, Im persuaded PayPal were within their 
rights to proceed with default action within the timeframe they did.
Im satisfied PayPal acted reasonably, given the circumstances and the lack of 
contact from Mrs A. So, I wont be asking them to do anything differently regarding 
the information theyve reported.
Having thought very carefully about this complaint and taking into account what Mr H said 
Im not persuaded to reach a different decision.
We wrote to Mr H by email on 24 March saying I wasnt inclined to provide an extension of 
time for the received call logs. I did though caveat this with an extension until 1 April for 
Mr H to outline what he considered the calls would prove. As at the time of writing this 
decision Ive seen no further contact from Mr H, and so am not persuaded delaying the case 
further is warranted.
The first matter to address is that of the missed payments. The credit agreement is clear that 
payments are required to be made by the payment due date. Payments were due on 18 
March 2019, 15 April 2019 and 16 May 2019 but no payments were made by Mrs A. The 
default notice issued thereafter clearly stated the following;
- Outstanding account balance of £528.68
- Amount of arrears £44.28
- The breach could be remedied by paying the arrears by 4 June 2019.The payment made at the end of May did not fully discharge the arrears and so was, in my 
determination, a partial payment of arrears and a payment for May in accordance with the 
credit agreement. And it did not remedy Mrs As breach of said agreement.  
It is not part of Mrs As case that she paid the arrears and PayPal made a mistake, or that 
PayPal had agreed to waive the breach. There is no evidence presented or suggested that 
persuades me PayPal agreed to extend the notice period for Mrs A to clear her arrears. 
Indeed, Junes payment was missed too so Im satisfied arrears remained.
Im satisfied PayPal acted fairly and were within their rights to proceed with default action 
within the timeframe they did. Im satisfied PayPal acted reasonably, given the 
circumstances and the lack of contact from Mrs A. So, I wont be asking them to do anything 
differently regarding the information theyve reported.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 May 2021.
