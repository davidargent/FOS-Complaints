The complaint
Miss E complains that Freemans plc hasnt credited her account with the value of all of the 
items that she returned to it.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Miss E used her credit account with Freemans for some online shopping and 
between September and November 2019 she returned five packages to it  it 
received the five packages but theres a discrepancy between the items that Miss E 
says that she returned and the number of items that Freemans says that it received 
(the difference is 17 items with a total value of £1,027.40);
Miss E complained to Freemans but wasnt satisfied with its response so complained 
to this service;
our investigator said that it wasnt going to be possible for either Miss E or Freemans 
to prove what was sent back in each of the packages but Miss E had suggested that 
the amount in dispute be reduced by 50% and he felt that that would be a reasonable 
solution for both  so he recommended that Freemans should refund £513.52 to 
Miss Es account;
Freemans didnt agree with that recommendation so our investigator looked at the 
evidence again and felt that it was more likely than not that Miss E did return all of 
the disputed items so he recommended that Freemans should refund the total 
disputed amount of £1,027.04 to her account;
Freemans says that its highly irregular for there to be issues like this with a number 
of packages and for a number of returned items not to be credited from each 
package  and for a customer to suggest a 50% settlement so early in the 
investigation of a complaint;
neither Freemans nor Miss E has been able to provide enough evidence to show 
what happened in these circumstances but where the evidence is incomplete, 
inconclusive or contradictory (as some of it is here), I reach my decision on the 
balance of probabilities  in other words, what I consider is most likely to have 
happened in light of the available evidence and the wider circumstances;
Miss E has had an account with Freemans since 2005 and its clear she had 
previously ordered and returned a large number of items  so its consistent with her 
previous conduct that she would return the items that she claimed she did  and 
during that time theres only been one issue with her returns;
she had also ordered the same items in more than one size with the expectation that 
she would return at least one of the sizes;
Ive carefully considered Freemans comments about: the likelihood of multiple items 
in multiple packages not being dealt with correctly; Miss Es delay in contacting it 
about the returns; and her settlement offer;
but having done so, I agree with the investigator that its more likely than not in these 
circumstances that Miss E did return the items to Freemans and that it didnt deal 
with those returns correctly; and
I find that it would be fair and reasonable for Freemans to credit £1,027.40 to 
Miss Es account.
Putting things right
I find that Freemans should credit £1,027.40 to Miss Es account.
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Miss Es complaint and I order Freemans plc to credit £1,027.40 
to Miss Es account.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss E to accept 
or reject my decision before 1 March 2021.
