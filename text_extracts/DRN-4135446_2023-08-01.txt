The complaint
Ms A complains NewDay Ltd didnt treat her fairly when it made changes to her credit card 
account.
 
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them here. 
Instead, I will focus on the reasons for my decision.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Miss A had an Amazon branded NewDay credit card account. In August 2022 NewDay 
informed Miss A its partnership with Amazon was ending. It said, in brief, her existing 
account would close unless she opted into a new account branded as Pulse. It gave her a 
deadline of 11 November 2022 to opt in. While I accept Miss A considers an opt out 
process should have been used, rather than an opt in one, it was for NewDay to decide 
how it wanted to manage the change and I dont find anything inherently unfair or 
unreasonable with NewDay doing as it did.
NewDay has shown it sent two emails and two text messages to Miss A to make her aware 
of the change and the need to review a letter in her online account. While Miss A considers 
this insufficient communication, and says NewDay made things difficult and confusing, I 
dont agree. In my view the number of communications were reasonable and proportionate. I 
find the letter which set out what was happening, why, what Miss As options were and what 
she needed to do, was clear. And I find the process to opt in, and the timeframe provided to 
do so, reasonable.
Miss A says she wanted a Pulse account and did opt in, so she should have been given one. 
Im not persuaded Miss A did opt in before the deadline. I say this because NewDay has 
provided its system notes and a search of its incoming calls logs. These show contact from 
Miss A in July 2022 and December 2022. There is therefore no evidence from NewDay, and 
I have seen no compelling evidence from Miss A, that any calls took place within the opt in 
period. As Im not persuaded Miss A opted in by the deadline, it follows I find it was fair and 
reasonable for NewDay not to change her account to a Pulse account.
My final decision
I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss A to accept 
or reject my decision before 29 August 2023.
