The complaint
S complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and their decision to permanently limit 
its account, while holding the funds within it.
S has been represented by its director. For ease of reference, I will refer to the comments 
and actions taken by both as S throughout the decision.
What happened
In January 2022, S opened a PayPal account, which it used to conduct its business activity 
online. PayPal reviewed this account at the start of April and took the decision to 
permanently limit the account. S responded to this, attempting to appeal the decision. But 
PayPal responded explaining the limitation was final and that the funds in the account would 
be held for up to 180 days before they could be withdrawn. S was unhappy about this, so it 
raised a complaint.
S didnt think PayPals decision to limit the account was fair and it was unhappy that a 
detailed explanation as to why hadnt been provided. And S didnt think it was reasonable for 
PayPal to hold the entire balance for up to 180 days so it wanted the majority of this 
available for withdrawal immediately, while recognising a small balance could be left in case 
sellers raised any disputes in the meantime.
PayPal responded to the complaint and didnt uphold it. They thought theyd acted in fairly, 
and in line with the user agreement, when taking the decision to limit the account and hold 
the accounts funds for up to 180 days. And they thought their reasoning for the limitation fell 
under their own commercial judgement, which they had no obligation to disclose. So, they 
didnt think they needed to do anything more. S remained unhappy with this response, so it 
asked our service to investigate.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. They thought the user 
agreement allowed PayPal to limit accounts that show high risk behaviour. And they were 
satisfied from the evidence PayPal had provided that there had been risk involved in the 
account activities. So, they didnt think PayPal had done anything wrong when limiting the 
account. Nor did they think PayPal were unfair to hold the funds in the account for up to 180 
days, as the user agreement allowed PayPal to do so. So, they didnt think PayPal needed 
to do anything more.
S didnt agree and remained unhappy and again queried why it hadnt been provided a 
detailed reason as to why the account was limited. As S didnt agree, the complaint has 
been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on S. I appreciate the permanent 
limitation wouldve come as a surprise to S and its short term business plan. And as PayPal 
havent explained exactly why they thought the limitation was appropriate, I can understand 
the difficulty this would place on S to plan how it intended to trade moving forwards. I can 
also appreciate the financial impact the limitation has had on S, as its been unable to 
access a significant amount of money still held in the account that its unable to withdraw 
until the 180-day time scale has elapsed. So, I understand why S think this shows PayPal 
acting both unfairly and unreasonably.
But for me to say PayPal have done something wrong, Id need to be satisfied they failed to 
act within the terms of the accounts user agreement when they placed the limitation and took 
the decision to hold the funds. Or, if I think PayPal did work within these, that it was unfair of 
them to do so. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
The user agreement S agreed to when it opened its account with PayPal explains that, 
where PayPal believes an account has engaged in restricted activities, they may Terminate 
this user agreement, limit your account and/or suspend your account, immediately and 
without penalty to us.
So, I think PayPal were able to permanently limit S account and prevent it from being used 
again without any notice, if they had reasonable reason to believe the account was engaging 
in activities that placed it as greater risk.
PayPal have provided me with evidence, as well as detailed comments, explaining why they 
decided to limit the account. And having considered this, I think PayPal were fair to do so 
and that this information qualified the account to be limited as shown in the term Ive quoted 
above.
While I appreciate S would like to understand the exact reasoning, this isnt something Im 
able to disclose as its commercially sensitive information. And I dont think PayPal have an 
obligation to disclose this information either, as by doing so they would be revealing 
information that forms a part of their commercial judgement relating to how they assess the 
risk of the accounts they provided. So, while I do understand S frustration surrounding this, I 
cant say PayPal have acted unfairly here. And I dont think they need to do anything more 
for this aspect of the complaint.
The user agreement also states that where PayPal reasonable believes a customer has 
engaged in restricted activities that they may hold your funds for up to 180 days if 
reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability. So, while I recognise S believes 
this timescale to be excessive, I think PayPal have acted fairly, and within the terms of the 
user agreement, when holding the funds for this length of time.
I can see PayPal have explained in their closure email that the funds are held to ensure 
there are funds to cover any chargebacks or disputes raised by S customers. And Ive seen 
in S complaint email to PayPal that this need was accepted. So, I dont think PayPals 
reasoning for holding the funds is unfair. PayPal have confirmed they will contact S to 
discuss the withdrawal of the remaining funds at the end of the 180-day period and this is 
what Id expect them to do. So, I dont think they need to do anything more on this occasion.
I understand this isnt the outcome S was hoping for. And I appreciate the situation will have 
been inconvenient and financially impactful. But Im only able to direct PayPal to do something if I feel theyve acted unfairly, or outside of the terms of the account S held. And I 
dont think thats the case here.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold S complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et 
Cie SCA. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask S to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 September 2022.
