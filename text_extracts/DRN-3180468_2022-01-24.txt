The cost per week column is the individual cost per loan per week. Where loans overlapped 
the cost per week will be greater. 
LAH has told us that Ms W had some problems repaying her final two loans and based on 
the information in its file submission to this Service, an outstanding amount remains.
Mrs Es representative had already referred the complaint to this Service when LAH issued 
its final response letter (FRL).  
LAH issued its FRL on 29 April 2021. It explained that Mrs E had made her complaint too 
late about loans 1 - 11, so it didnt investigate Mrs Es complaint further about these loans. 
LAH then considered loans 12  18 and following its investigation it concluded it hadnt made 
an error when these loans were advanced.   
 
One of our adjudicators looked at Mrs Es complaint. The assessment was split into two 
parts. 
In the first part, the adjudicator concluded, this Service could investigate loans 1  11 
because he couldnt see a reason to suggest that the loans had been complained about too 
late. Therefore, these loans were referred to this Service on time. Loans 12  18 could 
already been considered, as LAH hadnt said that these were complained about too late. 
 
In the second part, the adjudicator considered the merits of the complaint to see whether 
LAH had done anything wrong when it advanced these loans. He hadnt seen enough to 
uphold loans 1 - 7. 
But the adjudicator thought loans 8 - 18 should be upheld. She concluded that by loan 8 the 
pattern of lending had become harmful to Mrs E. So, LAH shouldnt have approved this loan, 
or any remaining loans.   
Mrs Es confirmed she agreed with the outcome the adjudicator reached. 
LAH didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment. In its response to the adjudicator LAH 
didnt focus on the merits of the case, instead it focused on whether this Service had the 
jurisdiction to consider loans 1  11. In summary it said:
It disagreed with the approach this Service had taken.
The approach is at odds with other, more recent complaints LAHs parent company 
had received. LAH provided examples of cases where a customer receiving arrears 
notices was sufficient to say that they ought to have been aware that they could 
complain. 
LAH told this Service Mrs E received arrears letters in 2013. She also requested her 
payments to be stopped and requested a chargeback request rom her bank in order 
to recover the payments between 2014  2016. In October 2016, LAH also carried 
out a financial difficulties assessment. 
The adjudicator has disregarded LAHs points about jurisdiction and the regulations 
this Service must follow. 
No evidence has been provided as to why this case is in this Services jurisdiction 
and as such, LAH hasnt given this Service approval to consider these loans.  
The adjudicator went back to LAH and explained why its comments didnt change his mind. 
He said he wasnt commenting on the cases LAH provided because he was assessing
Mrs Es complaint. He also reiterated hed not seen anything to make him think Mrs E had 
complained too late. 
As no agreement could be reached the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
Why I can look into this complaint
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments provided by Mrs E and LAH to 
decide whether we are able to look at loans 1 -11. Having done so, I have reached the same 
conclusion as the adjudicator  that I have the power to consider loans 1  11 (as well as 
loans 12  18). Ill explain why. 
The rules I must apply say that, where a business doesnt agree, I cant look at a complaint 
made more than six years after whats been complained about. Or if later, more than three 
years after the complainant in this case, Mrs E knew, or ought to really have known they had 
reason to complain. This is set out in Dispute Resolution rule 2.8.2R and can be found online in the FCAs Handbook. 
Its clear loans 1 to 11 were complained about more than six years after they were taken. 
However, Ive not seen anything to persuade me Mrs E was aware or ought to have been 
reasonably aware more than three years before she raised this complaint, that she had 
reason to complain. 
LAH has said that when Mrs E experienced repayment problems and received arrears letters 
in 2013, and chargeback payments between 2013 and 2016, these shouldve caused her to 
realise she had reason to complain. But I dont think this is enough in this particular case to 
demonstrate that.
I say this because whilst experiencing repayment problems and therefore struggling to repay 
the lending would no doubt have led Mrs E to realise there was a problem (in terms of her 
financial difficulty), Im not persuaded this would have (or ought to have), in itself, made her  
aware that these problems were caused by LAH doing something wrong when it agreed the 
loans.
And I havent seen anything else to persuade me that Mrs E was or ought to have become 
aware earlier of cause to complain more than three years before they complained. 
So, like our adjudicator, I think loans 1 to 11 were raised within the time limits I need to apply 
and that I do have the power to consider these loans Mrs E was given. Ill now go on and 
consider whether or not I think all the loans complained about were lent responsibly. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice
at the time the loan was provided.
LAH needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mrs E could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts, and
the consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might point to the fact that LAH should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for Mrs E. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become or was becoming
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.I think that it is important for me to say that LAH was required to establish whether Mrs E 
could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is
the case. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this
context and what this all mean for Mrs Es complaint.
Loans 1 to 7
The adjudicator didnt uphold Mrs Es complaint about these loans. Mrs E agreed with the 
adjudicators findings, so I no longer think these loans are in dispute. 
But I have kept in mind these loans when thinking about Mrs E overall lending relationship 
with LAH.  
Loans 8 - 18
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 8 - 18 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. 
In addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Mrs E, LAH also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Mrs E.
Having looked at the overall pattern of LAHs lending history with Mrs E, LAH should 
reasonably have seen that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the 
time it provided loan 8. I say this because:
By loan 8 it was just over 8 months into the lending relationship with Mrs E indebted 
to LAH for the entire time. And, by this point Mrs E now had four loans overlapping 
and was repaying £40 per week. In my view, Mrs Es loan history up until this point 
was a clear indication that her underlying financial situation didnt seem to be 
improving. 
Mrs Es first loan was for £100 with loan 8 being £200  so it was for twice the 
amount and as Ive said above, there were three other loans running at the same 
time, so her overall indebtedness had increased significantly.   
Mrs E, up to this point, had showed signs that when a loan had been repaid a new 
one was taken out on the same day, for example loans 3  4 and loans 6 - 7. LAH 
ought to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs E, on these occasions, was 
having to borrow further to effectively cover a long-term financial need. To me, this is 
an indication of her indebtedness not being sustainable.
From loan 8 onwards Mrs Es pattern of taking new loans shortly after a previous 
loan had been repaid continued and she continued to have up to three loans running 
at the same time. 
Mrs E showed no meaningful decrease in the amount she borrowed. Indeed, the 
longer she borrowed the more her weekly commitment went up, and by loan 18 she 
was paying LAH £70 per week. I think its most likely this consistent pattern of 
borrowing over the period showed that Mrs E didnt just have a short-term cash-flow 
problem but was probably supporting regular living expenses or other financial 
commitments over a longer term.By the point of loan 18, Mrs E was making a commitment to make repayments to 
LAH for almost another year, after already being indebted for the last 6 years. This 
was also one of the largest loans Mrs E took.  The amount of time that Mrs E spent 
indebted to LAH meant that she was in effect servicing a debt to LAH over an 
extended period of time.
The above further reinforces my view these loans were unsustainable, because 
Mrs E went on to have significant repayment problems and loans 17 and 19 remain 
outstanding over two years after being advanced.   
I think that Mrs E lost out when LAH provided loans 8 - 18 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Es indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the number of loans and time in debt was likely to have had negative implications on 
Mrs Es ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 8 - 18. Ill go on to set out what LAH 
should do to put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress LAH should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what
might have happened had it not provided lending from loan 8, as Im satisfied it ought to
have. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mrs E may have simply left matters there, 
not attempting to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed
between them and this particular lender which they may not have had with others. If this
wasnt a viable option, they may have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative 
assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would
have been able to lend to Mrs E in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Mrs E would more likely than not have taken up any one of 
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce LAHs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
LAH shouldnt have given Mrs E loans 8 - 18. If LAH have sold the outstanding debts it 
should buy these back if it is able to do so and then take the following steps. If LAH are not 
able to buy the debts back then it should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the 
results outlined below
A. LAH should add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs E towards 
interest, fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything it has already refunded.
B. LAH should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs E 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs E originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C. LAH should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mrs E as though they had 
been repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mrs E 
having made overpayments then LAH should refund these overpayments with 8% 
simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the overpayments 
would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. LAH should then refund the 
amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus then the surplus should be paid to Mrs E. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then LAH should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with 
Mrs E. LAH shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made up of principal it has 
already written-off. 
E. The overall pattern of Mrs Es borrowing for loans 8 - 18 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so LAH should remove these loans entirely from 
Mrs Es credit file. LAH do not have to remove loans 17 and 18 from Mrs Es credit 
file until these have been repaid, but LAH should still remove any adverse 
information recorded about these loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires LAH to take off tax from this interest. LAH
must give Mrs E a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained above, Im upholding Mrs Es complaint in part.
 
S.D. Taylor Limited should put things right for Mrs E as directed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs E to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 February 2022.
