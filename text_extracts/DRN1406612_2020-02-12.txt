K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains on behalf of P, a limited company that National Westminster  Bank  Plc 
closed its business  accounts. Mr M also complains  that NatWest placed  a fraud marker 
against his name. 
P is represented by its director Mr M. 
background
Mr M had a business account with NatWest. Following a review  of the account NatWest 
closed it giving Mr M 60 days  notice.  NatWest also closed his personal  accounts.
Mr M complained to the bank, he didnt think anything had changed in the way he used the 
account that could prompt NatWest to give him notice of closure. He thought the closure  of 
his accounts had been prompted by a complaint he had made to the bank about his 
business account. He was concerned that someone may have compromised his identity. 
And thinks the accounts were closed unnecessarily.
NatWest said it hadnt  made a mistake when it closed the account. And had done so in 
accordance with the terms  and conditions of the account. 
Mr M complained to our service. The investigator thought  NatWest  hadnt acted unfairly in 
closing the business account. NatWest had given 60 days  notice and complied with the 
terms and conditions.
Mr M wasnt happy with our view because he felt he had been unfairly treated by NatWest  
and he said the Banking: Conduct of Business Sourcebook (BCOBS) should  override the 
banks terms and conditions. Mr M would like his accounts reinstated.
As no agreement could be reached  the matter has come to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
A bank  is entitled  to close an account with a customer just as a customer may close  an 
account with a bank. But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way which 
complies with the terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions  of the account  which both NatWest and Mr M had to comply with 
 say that it could  close  the account by giving him 60 days notice. NatWest  has done this. 
So, its entitled to close the accounts  as it seems its already done.
Mr M says NatWest  have not treated him fairly. Hes argued  BCOBS  should override the 
terms and conditions.
As Mr M has mentioned  it, I have looked at BCOBS  paragraph 5.1.1R  which says a firm 
must provide a service which is prompt, efficient and fair. I have also considered  the 
principles in the FCA handbook. Principle 6 requires a firm to treat its customers  fairly. I 
know that Mr M feels NatWest havent treated him fairly because  it has closed his account.  
But the bank can make a commercial  decision  about who it offers  banking  services to. But in 
Ref: DRN14066122making the commercial  decision to close his business account  NatWest must treat him fairly. 
I have looked  at whether NatWest has done  so, and I am satisfied that it has acted fairly.
I know Mr M was disappointed NatWest decided to close his business account. But as I have 
said, the bank  can make commercial decisions about who it offers banking services to. It 
cannot unfairly discriminate against a customer.  But it can say it no longer wishes to do 
business with individuals  or small  businesses. Thats because  it has the commercial freedom 
to decide who it wants to contract  with. I am satisfied that NatWest has exercised its 
commercial decision legitimately when  it decided to close  Mr Ms business account so I cant 
fairly and reasonably say its done  anything  wrong.
As an individual representing the company Mr M was also concerned about a fraud marker 
that NatWest placed on his account.  NatWest gave him the impression this was the reason 
why the account was closed. It has confirmed the marker is internal only and it was placed 
on the account when the account closed and in order to prevent  future  applications from 
Mr M. I am satisfied the marker is not an external marker which  would affect Mr Ms ability  to 
get banking services elsewhere  as an individual or as a representative of a company.
In summary,  I recognise how strongly Mr M feels about whats happened, and I dont doubt it 
was a frustrating  time. I realise Mr M will be disappointed  by my decision, but overall,  based 
on the evidence  Ive seen, I cant say NatWest  has acted  unreasonably and treated Mr M 
unfairly when it closed his account. So, Im not going  to ask them to do anything.
my final decision
For the reasons  I ve explained I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M on behalf of 
P to accept  or reject  my decision before 12 March 2020.
