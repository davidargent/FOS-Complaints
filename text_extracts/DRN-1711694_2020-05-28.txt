Complaint
Mr H says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) irresponsibly provided 
unaffordable credit to him.                           
Background
This complaint is about one running account facility and sixty-seven high-cost short term 
credit instalment loans Sunny provided to Mr H between November 2014 and April 2019. 
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Hs complaint and thought that he shouldnt have been provided 
with instalment loans 5 to 67. Sunny didnt agree. So the complaint was passed to me.
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all the key relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr H could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided. Having 
looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr H, I think that Sunny should 
reasonably have seen that Mr H was unlikely to have been able to make his payments in a 
sustainable manner by the time it provided Mr H with instalment loan 5. I say this because transitioned Mr H from a facility which its own product literature said 
shouldnt be used for extended periods to a series of instalment loans which had the same 
effect. Mr H was then provided with new loans shortly after repaying previous ones. In my 
view, Mr H was displaying a pattern of borrowing consistent with someone who may have 
been in financial difficulty rather than to cover a short-term need.  
Sunny continued lending to Mr H even when this pattern was repeated and in circumstances 
where it ought reasonably to have realised that any further loans were more likely than not 
unsustainable for him. 
Mr H had to pay interest and charges on loans that Sunny shouldnt have provided him with. 
So I think that he lost out and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mr H paid on instalment loans 5 to 67;
 
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement;
 
The number of loans provided means any information recorded as a result of 
instalment loans 5 to 67 is adverse. So all reference to these loans should be 
removed from Mr Hs credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Hs complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should pay Mr H compensation as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 June 2020.
