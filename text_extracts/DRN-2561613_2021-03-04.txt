The complaint
 Mr B and Mrs B complain that they were unable to transfer money from their National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) joint account, to an account they had elsewhere with a 
different bank (X).
What happened
 The details of this complaint are well-known to both parties, so I will not repeat them again 
here in any great detail. Mr Bs account with NatWest was subject to fraudulent activity. His 
debit card was stopped. In June 2020 Mr B attempted to pay money into his bank account 
with X by writing a cheque on his NatWest account, but it was returned unpaid. He tried for a 
second time by getting Mrs B to sign the cheque, but it was returned again, and he was told 
that was because there was no mandate set up on the account.
In its final response letter dated 20 July 2020, NatWest acknowledged it had provided a poor 
service, so it paid Mr B and Mrs B £150 in compensation and £10.80 for the cost of the calls 
they had incurred in contacting NatWest.
Mr B and Mrs B were unhappy with NatWests final response and so approached this service 
to see if we could assist in resolving the dispute. Our investigator thought that although there 
had been poor service, the amount of compensation NatWest offered and paid was enough 
to put things right.
Mr B and Mrs B didnt agree and asked for the complaint to be passed to an Ombudsman for 
a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
 As a starting point Mr B and Mrs B have held their account with NatWest for many many 
years and never experienced any problems when issuing cheques. NatWest have accepted 
that there were no signing rules in place on Mr B and Mrs Bs account and have candidly 
accepted that they do not know why that is. And although the matter had never arisen 
before, NatWest suspect that might be because of the amount of money Mr B was seeking 
to transfer which triggered the cheque being returned. Nat West have however confirmed 
that Mr B and Mrs Bs account became operational again from 8 September 2020.
Mr B has pointed out that he has been kept out of his money for quite some time, and I 
would agree that he has. It is very unfortunate that NatWest had not made sure its 
processes were up to date because it was this which caused Mr B and Mrs B the problems.
NatWest has accepted that it didnt get things right and because of that it compensated Mr B 
and Mrs B with £150 as well as paying £10.80 to cover 2 hours of calls costs. As Mr B and 
Mrs B didnt think that was enough to put matters right, Ive given this some further. I do of 
course note that when NatWest made its offer that was in July 2020 and the difficulties for 
Mr B and Mrs B continued after that for another 7 weeks. And I take into account from Mr Bs 
correspondence that he became reliant on family and friends to some degree to get by.
I issued my Provisional Decision on the 28 January 2021 and Mr B and Mrs B and NatWest 
have responded. NatWest said they had nothing further to say. Mr B and Mrs B said they 
they felt NatWest had totally ignored their letters which had caused them further distress.
Putting things right
 As I said in my Provisional Decision I do think NatWest should compensate Mr B and Mrs B 
and I do think that the sum of £150 is insufficient, since it does not take account of the entire 
inconvenience and distress caused. I know Mr B and Mrs B have since my Provisional 
Decision raised the issue of being ignored by NatWest, but as this wasnt part of their 
original complaint I cant take it into account. I therefore intend to award £300 as I think this 
will be enough to put matters right and is fair and reasonable. I think in the absence of any 
direct evidence as to the cost of the calls Mr B made, the sum of £10.80 is fair and 
reasonable and so I do not intend to make any further award in respect of that.
 
My final decision
National Westminster Bank Plc shall pay Mr B and Mrs B £300 compensation plus £10.80 
towards the cost of calls, to settle this complaint.
 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs B and Mr B to 
accept or reject my decision before 1 April 2021.
