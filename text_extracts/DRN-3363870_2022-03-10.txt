Mr B complained that 118 118 Money shouldnt have lent to him as he had a gambling 
addiction.
118 118 Money looked into his complaint and didnt uphold it. It said it had carried out proper 
checks and it thought the loans were sustainable. Mr B referred his complaint to us. 
I issued a provisional decision explaining why I was minded to uphold this complaint in part. 
An extract from my provisional findings is set out below:
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending - 
including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions 
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr Bs complaint. These two 
questions are:
1. Did 118 118 Money complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr B would be able to repay the loans without experiencing significant adverse 
consequences?
If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
If not, would those checks have shown that Mr B wouldve been able to do so?
2. Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
The rules and regulations in place required 118 118 Money to carry out a reasonable and 
proportionate assessment of Mr Bs ability to make the repayments under this agreement. 
This assessment is sometimes referred to as an affordability assessment or affordability 
check.
The checks had to be borrower-focused  so 118 118 Money had to think about whether 
repaying the loan would be sustainable. In practice this meant that the business had to 
ensure that making the repayments on the loan wouldnt cause Mr B undue difficulty or 
significant adverse consequences. That means he should have been able to meet 
repayments out of normal income without having to borrow to meet the repayments, without 
failing to make any other payment he had a contractual or statutory obligation to make and 
without the repayments having a significant adverse impact on his financial situation.
In other words, it wasnt enough for 118 118 Money to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr B. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a 
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the 
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of 
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount/type/cost of credit they are seeking. Even 
for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have 
been more thorough:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Bs complaint.
Loan 1
When he applied for the loan, Mr B told 118 118 Money that his monthly income was £2,840 
and he said he had no regular outgoings. To check that, 118 118 Money carried out a credit 
search and verified his income. 118 118 Money calculated that Mr B had monthly living 
costs of £710 and credit commitments of £303.90. On those figures he would have had a 
disposable income of £1,664.60 after making the new loan repayment of £161.50 to 118 118 
Money.
118 118 Money also carried out a credit search before granting the loan. This showed that 
Mr B had a hire purchase account, a credit card and a telecommunications account, all of 
which hed paid well. There were two defaults from five years previously on credit accounts 
that had since been settled.
I think 118 118 Moneys checks were proportionate given the size and term of the loan and 
the value of the repayment in relation to Mr Bs monthly income So I dont think 118 118 
Money ought to have been concerned the loan wouldnt be sustainably affordable for Mr B. 
It follows I dont think 118 118 Money was wrong to give Mr B Loan 1. Loan 2
Using the same approach as for Loan 1, 118 118 Money carried out a credit search and 
verified Mr Bs income of £2,007 a month. It calculated that Mr B had monthly living costs of 
£1,080 and credit commitments of £380. On those figures he would have had a disposable 
income of £878.43 after making the new loan repayment of £114.67 to 118 118 Money. 
118 118 Money carried out another credit search before granting this loan. This showed that 
Mr B had three current accounts, a hire purchase account, a credit card and a 
telecommunications account, all of which hed paid well. There was a late payment on a loan 
in the previous 24 months which had since been settled and on a utility bill in 2015. It also 
knew that Mr B had repaid Loan 1 in line with his agreement.
Again I think 118 118 Moneys checks were proportionate given the size and term of the loan 
and the value of the repayment in relation to Mr Bs monthly income. I can understand why 
overall 118 118 Money thought the credit check was satisfactory and that the loan would be 
sustainably affordable for Mr B.
In February 2018 Mr B told 118 118 Money that hed been underpaid and wouldnt be able to 
make the repayment due in March but could make two payments the following month which 
he duly did. In August 2018 Mr B told 118 118 Money he couldnt make the repayment due 
that month due to having to pay a deposit and fees in connection with moving house. Again 
he made up for it the following month. This loan was later repaid in full out of the proceeds of 
Loan 3.
Loan 3
When he applied for this loan, Mr Bs monthly income was still £2,007 and he said he paid 
rent of £700. 118 118 Money carried out a credit search and verified his income again. It 
calculated that hed have other regular outgoings of about £501.70. Based on the credit 
search 118 118 Money calculated that Mr B had monthly credit commitments of £380. On 
those figures he would have had a disposable income of £269.99 after making the new loan 
repayment of £155.31 to 118 118 Money.
118 118 Money said it carried out a further credit search before granting the loan and the 
result was similar to the previous one. The search would probably have shown that Mr B 
had missed a repayment with another finance company but hed cleared the arrears within 
two months as he had with Loan 2.
Ive carefully considered what 118 118 Money has said about how it calculated Mr Bs 
disposable income before it made Loan 3. I dont think its checks were proportionate. This 
was now Mr Bs third loan with 118 118 Money, and it was for a larger amount. His 
repayments would be about 35% higher than for Loan 2 where hed twice struggled to make 
repayments on time. His credit commitments with the Loan 3 repayment would be more than 
25% of his monthly income. Due to these factors I think 118 118 Money should carried out 
further checks to assure itself that Mr B would be able to repay the loan in a sustainable way 
over the 24-month term. I think it ought to have carried out a more thorough review of Mr Bs 
finances. As I cant see that this was done, I dont think that the checks carried out before 
providing Mr B with this loan were reasonable and proportionate.
Ive looked at Mr Bs bank statements from around the time he applied for this loan. Im not 
suggesting here that these are the checks that 118 118 Money should necessarily have 
done. But I think looking at these would have given a good indication of the extent of Mr Bs 
gambling addiction at this time. These show that in the two month period before he took out 
Loan 3 he spent at least £2,900 on gambling. So I can be certain that 118 118 Money would 
have uncovered information showing the loan would be unaffordable for Mr B because of his addiction to gambling. So I dont think that 118 118 Money treated Mr B fairly when it agreed 
to make Loan 3 as it was likely that giving him more credit would simply add to his 
indebtedness.
Ive also thought about whether 118 118 Money acted unfairly in some other way and I 
havent seen any evidence that it did.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As both parties agreed with my provisional findings, I see no reason to change them and 
they now form part of this final decision.
Putting things right
To put things right I think 118 118 Money should:
remove all interest, fees and charges applied to Loan 3;
treat any payments made by Mr B as payments towards the capital amount of 
£1952.61;
if Mr B has paid more than the capital then any overpayments should be refunded to 
him with 8% simple interest* from the date they were paid to the date of settlement,
but if theres still an outstanding balance, 118 118 Money should come to a 
reasonable repayment plan with Mr B; and
remove any negative information about Loan 3 from Mr Bs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires 118 118 Money to take off tax from this interest. 118 118 
Money must give Mr B a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold Mr Bs complaint and require Madison CF UK Limited 
trading as 118 118 Money to put things right for Mr B as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 April 2022.
