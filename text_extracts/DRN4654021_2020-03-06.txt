K820x#14complaint
Ms C has complained PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA wont  pay her for bitcoins she sold in 
February 2018. She thinks PayPals systems allowed these fraudulent transactions to take 
place.
background
Ms C was selling bitcoins using her PayPal account  to collect  funds. She sold two lots to two 
different parties  on 18 February 2018. She was paid £2,839.71 and £609.97 for the sales.  
She then found  out both parties who she thought  had bought  her bitcoins hadnt. Both 
parties had said their own PayPal accounts had been misused along with their credit cards  
to pay for something theyd not authorised. PayPal received  chargeback requests which they 
had no choice but to repay. Ms C had initially withdrawn both lots of funds to her own bank 
account but had repaid £2,879.31 on 22 February to PayPal. But in the end Ms Cs PayPal 
account ended up with a negative balance which  PayPal was asking  her to repay.
Ms C brought her complaint to the ombudsman  service.
Our investigator thought PayPal should repay  the money to Ms C. He found it difficult to tell 
whether PayPal had used  the right criteria to agree to refund payments under the 
chargeback rules as PayPal wouldnt share  this information. He noted Ms Cs transactions 
werent eligible  for seller  protection but felt PayPal  hadnt acted fairly or reasonably.
PayPal disagreed with this outcome.  Theyve asked an ombudsman  to consider this 
complaint.
I completed a provisional decision on 27 January 2020. I felt PayPals  seller  protection didnt 
apply to the transactions Ms C had made  and I didnt  think PayPal had any choice but to 
accept the chargeback requests and refund  the money Ms C had received.  
PayPal accepted this outcome. Ms C didnt.  She re-sent copies of confirmations from PayPal 
that shed received money in her account  following her bitcoin sales  and other 
correspondence with PayPal. This confirmed  shed been told buyers wouldnt be able to 
submit PayPal requests  for refunds as their transactions  wouldnt be covered by PayPals 
buyer protection policy. This didnt clarify these transactions  could still be subject to 
chargeback requests. She still felt shed been misled by PayPal.
I now have all I need to complete  a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive reached the same 
conclusion as I did in my provisional  decision. Ill explain why.  
The facts  of this complaint  arent  really in dispute.  Ms C sold bitcoins and received payment 
through her PayPal  account. She then withdrew the money from her PayPal account.
Someone had misused both of the buyers  accounts and their credit  cards. The real buyers 
had not authorised these purchases. On this basis PayPal had no choice but to repay the 
money which had never been authorised. 
Ref: DRN46540212I know our investigator felt we should see more information about the chargeback requests 
and the original buyers. In an ideal world I agree. But I think in all likelihood this information 
would have shown  that the card use had been unauthorised. The card companies  would 
have been legally obliged to refund their customers  and PayPal would  have had no choice 
but to refund  the monies  involved.
I dont think Ms C disagrees with this either  as she accepts all parties  involved  are victims of 
this fraud.  She believes PayPal told her there could not be successful chargebacks. 
Unfortunately there is no copy  of this phone conversation as PayPal rarely retains this 
evidence. I agree with Ms C this is unfortunate but its not suspicious.  Ive considered 
whether they may have told her this or not. I think this is possible but by that stage shed 
already made the decision to proceed with the sale which  she accepts. So I dont think this 
would have made any difference to what Ms C did.
Ms C doesnt understand why she didnt get the same sort of protection afforded  to the 
buyers. Actually like the buyer, Ms C received no protection through  PayPals User 
Agreement.
Ive reviewed PayPals  User Agreement. This states  there is no seller protection given when  
bitcoins are involved. Although Ms C has told us she wasnt  aware of this, I find that 
surprising. I agree Ms C didnt get transactions emails from PayPal confirming the 
transactions werent eligible  for seller protection but I dont think, as I state above, this would 
have made  any difference. I suspect if shed viewed  transaction  records on her account this 
information would have been  clear.
In both cases PayPal  categorises the transactions to have involved personal  payments. 
Ms C seemed to confirm  she was aware of this limitation in an email (although wonders how 
someone could  be expected to keep abreast of the User Agreement  that closely). Those 
also do not fall under any protection PayPal offers sellers  nothing  is being sent for delivery 
in that way. Ms Cs sales were digitally-based.
I know Ms C is upset  about how shes been asked  to repay the debt. This has now been 
hanging over her for over a year and a half. But I dont think  it would  be fair to ask PayPal to 
repay the money she lost on the bitcoin  sales. I believe  the User  Agreement terms were 
clear and Ms C wouldve been  able to find this out before she made the original transactions.
Ms C blames PayPal for what happened. She thinks their systems are insecure and led to 
the frauds happening in the first place. Shes  also critical about the lack of action and 
investigation they carried out. I absolutely  appreciate PayPal advertise their services as the 
safer way to pay and Ms C feels this isnt the case. PayPal is an online payment  scheme  
and not a bank offering a full range  of services so their systems and the way they manage 
these will differ. The customers  they attract also offer different services.
Ive said previously it is not the ombudsman services role to investigate what PayPal  do 
more generally when dealing with fraud. Were not their regulator.
Both Ms C and the people whose accounts  were misused are victims of fraud. Two of them 
got refunded whilst Ms C has lost out. Ms C has neither her bitcoins nor the money.  I 
absolutely understand how this outcome must seem unfair to her. But unfortunately I cant  
ask PayPal to refund  her.
Ref: DRN46540213my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given, my final decision is not to uphold Ms Cs complaint against 
PayPal Europe  Sarl & Cie, SCA.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 April 2020.
