In Early August 2022, she complained to Skyline and explained that had they carried out 
sufficient checks during the application process, they ought to have known the loans were 
unaffordable for her.
Skyline looked into Mrs Rs concerns and issued their final response in September 2022. 
They explained they could only investigate the loans taken out within the last six years, and 
having done so, they could only agree additional checks should have been carried out for 
loans 9, 10, and 11. Because of that, they offered to refund the interest Mrs R paid towards 
those loans, and 8% simple interest. They also offered to remove details of those three loans 
from Mrs Rs credit file. Mrs R remained unhappy, so she brought her complaint to our 
service.
Our Investigator looked into Mrs Rs complaint and explained we could investigate all 13 
loans. However, he didnt comment on the lending decision for loans 1 and 2. Regarding the 
other loans, our Investigator thought Skyline also shouldnt have given Mrs R loans 7, 8, 12 
and 13. 
Skyline disagreed with our Investigators findings, so Mrs Rs complaint was passed to me 
for a decision.
I issued my provisional decision on 3 November 2023. I explained I was minded to consider 
there were an additional two loans that we had the power to investigate  however, I wasnt 
persuaded there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate they shouldnt have been approved. 
I also considered Mrs R shouldnt have been given additional borrowing from loans 6, 
onwards.
Both parties had until 24 November 2023 to respond. Mrs R didnt respond at all, and 
Skyline said there wasnt enough evidence to show the first two loans existed. While I took 
on board what Skyline had said, I wasnt persuaded to change my mind. So, my decision 
has remained the same.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding Mrs Rs complaint, in part. Ill explain my reasoning below.
Skylines offer for loans 9, 10, and 11
Skylines final response letter accepted theyd made a mistake with loans 9, 10, and 11. To 
put things right, they offered to:
Refund the interest paid towards those loans.
Pay Mrs R 8% simple interest on the refunded amount.
Remove details of those loans from Mrs Rs credit file.
This offer is line with our services approach to irresponsible lending. As such, I wont be 
asking Skyline to do anything further regarding these loans, and my decision will focus on 
the other loans complained about.
Loans 1 and 2
The Financial Conduct Authority sets the rules that govern our service, and the relevant rule 
in this case is DISP 2.8.2. This says we can only consider complaints raised within six years 
of the event complained of. If later, within three years of the consumer becoming aware or 
when they ought reasonably to have become aware they had cause for complaint.
Mrs R complained about Skylines lending decisions, so these are the events complained of. 
In turn, this means Mrs R had six years from the date each loan was approved, to complain 
about them. 
Skyline has no evidence for loans 1 and 2 due to the time thats passed. However, Mrs R 
says they were approved in December 2011 and January 2012. The fact Skyline doesnt 
have evidence of these loans, isnt proof in itself that they didnt exist. So, I dont agree with 
their assertion that our service shouldnt consider them as part of this complaint. When 
Mrs R complained to Skyline, she included these loans in her complaint letter and detailed 
how much she borrowed. Given the information in her complaint letter somewhat matched 
the details Skyline held about her other loans, Im inclined to believe loans 1 and 2 were 
given to her. But as the loans were approved more than six years before Mrs R complained, 
her complaint for these loans was raised out of time under the six-year part of the rule.I next considered the three-year part of the rule. To this, I had to determine when Mrs R 
became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware:
1. the loans were unaffordable;
2. the unaffordable loans caused her loss; and
3. Skylines actions (or failure to act) contributed to her loss.
Mrs R says she only became aware there may have been a problem with her loans after she 
was contacted by a claims management company. And after reflecting on the financial 
difficulties she experienced while the loan accounts were open, she felt Skyline may have 
lent to her irresponsibly and that is when she raised her complaint.
Ive seen no evidence, from either party to suggest Mrs R ought reasonably to have become 
aware she may have been unhappy with the loans before she raised her complaint in 2022. 
So, its for that reason Im satisfied her complaints about loans 1 and 2 were raised in time.
While Im persuaded Mrs R complained about these loans in time, I cant ignore the fact that 
neither Skyline nor Mrs R has clear evidence to confirm how much the loans were for (that is 
why I havent commented on their value in the table above), or what her financial 
circumstances were at the time of borrowing. I dont consider its unreasonable either party 
has minimal information given the time thats passed. 
I can only ask Skyline to put things right if I can safely conclude their actions resulted in 
Mrs R experiencing a loss. So, in the absence of the evidence detailed above, Im not 
upholding Mrs Rs complaint about loans 1 and 2.
Loans 3, 4, and 5
Due to the times that passed theres limited information available to detail Mrs Rs financial 
circumstances at the time. While Ive been unable to see what information was showing on 
Mrs Rs credit file when she took out these loans between December 2016 and July 2017, 
Skyline has sent us the income and expenditure they relied on.
The information Ive seen shows that Mrs R had a disposable income of between £162 and 
£53 pounds per month. This was after the loan payments were added to her expenditure, 
alongside a buffer of £15 per month. This suggests the loans ought to have been affordable 
for Mrs R, and in the absence of anything else I cant safely conclude that Skyline ought to 
have carried out additional checks before lending to her.
Given the above Im persuaded Skyline relied on sufficient information for these loans, and 
that information suggested the loans were affordable for Mrs R. As such, I dont consider 
anything needs to be done to put things right for these loans.
Loans 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13 
By the time Mrs R applied for loan 6 in December 2017, I consider she was starting to show 
a pattern of borrowing. This loan was taken out just five months after loan 5, and for an 
increased amount. This ought to have made Skyline consider whether Mrs R was becoming 
reliant on borrowing to supplement her financial circumstances. So, its at this stage they 
ought to have carried out additional checks.
Had Skyline carried out further checks at this point, I consider they would have realised this 
pattern of borrowing may not be sustainable for Mrs R. I say this because Ive seen Mrs Rs 
bank statement from November 2017. This showed that she was paying for borrowing elsewhere and that she was frequently using her overdraft. This demonstrates she was 
unlikely to be able to afford this loan without borrowing from elsewhere.
In light of this, and because this pattern of borrowing continued over a relatively short period 
time, I consider Skyline shouldnt have approved loan 6, or any of the other loans after this.
For the reasons above, Im upholding Mrs Rs complaint in respect of loans 6, 7, 8,12, and 
13.
My final decision
My final decision is that Im upholding Mrs Rs complaint about Skyline Direct Limited.
To put things right, Skyline Direct Limited should:
Add up the total amount of money Mrs R received as a result of having been given 
loans 6,7,8,12, and 13. The repayments Mrs R made should be deducted from this 
amount. 
a) If this results in Mrs R having paid more than she received, any overpayments 
should be refunded along with 8% simple interest (calculated from the date the 
overpayments were made until the date of settlement). 
b) If any capital balance remains outstanding, then Skyline Direct Limited should 
attempt to arrange an affordable and suitable payment plan with Mrs R.
To remove any negative information recorded on Mrs Rs credit file relating to loans 
6,7,8,12 and 13.
Skyline Direct Limited has already offered to put things right for loans 9,10, and 11. 
They should apply the same award detailed above to those loans if theyve not 
already done so.
 If HM Revenue & Customs requires Mrs R to take off tax from this interest, Skyline Direct 
Limited must give Mrs R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 January 2024.
