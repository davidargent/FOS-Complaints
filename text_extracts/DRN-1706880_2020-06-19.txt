The complaint
Mr P says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr P says the lending was unaffordable for him. He is now in a debt management 
plan.                            
What happened
This complaint is about 28 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mr P between July 2017 and 
February 2017. Mr Ps borrowing history for the first 15 loans is as follows:

Mr P took a further 13 loans between October 2016 and February 2017. The amounts 
borrowed ranged between £150 and £950. My understanding is that loans 24, 27 and 28 are 
still outstanding. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ps complaint and thought the loans from loan 12 
onwards onwards shouldnt have been given as it looked likely Mr P was persistently reliant 
upon this type of credit. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan 16. But because of the 
outstanding balance on the loans, nothing would be payable to Mr P.
We put the offer to Mr P, but he wasnt willing to accept it. He said he wanted the 
outstanding balance written off, loans 16 and onwards to be removed from his credit report 
and to be paid £150 as a gesture of goodwill.
In response, Sunny said it was willing to write off the outstanding balance of £911.72 and 
remove the loans from loan 16 onwards from Mr Ps credit report. But it wasnt willing to pay 
a goodwill gesture of £150.
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me to decide in my role as 
ombudsman. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr P could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
 
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable). 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr P could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr P didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to 11 shouldnt be upheld. 
Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. So, I 
wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr P had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
the complaint in part. Ill explain why.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr P, with a view to seeing if 
there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Ps case, and like the adjudicator, I think that this 
point was reached by loan 12. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr P was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr P had taken out 12 loans in 14 months. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr P was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Ps 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mr Ps first loan was for £150 and loan 12 was for £600.  At this point Sunny ought to 
have known that Mr P was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in his 
income but to meet an ongoing need. 
 
From loan 12 onwards Mr P was provided with a new loan within days or weeks of 
settling a previous one. As examples, Loan 12 was taken the same day that loan ten 
was repaid  and it was for the same amount. Loan 16 was taken two days after 
loans 13 to 15 were repaid and it was for the largest amount borrowed of £950. So, I 
think this further indicates the borrowing was unsustainable for Mr P.
 Mr P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 28 was 
taken out 19 months after Mr Ps first. And it was for a larger amount. Mr P had paid 
large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
 
I think that Mr P lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 12 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
 
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr P borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Ps ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 12 to 28 and Sunny should put things right.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do
If the outstanding balance due on Mr Ps loans has been transferred to a third party Sunny 
should buy the loans back if it can. If Sunny cant buy the loans back, then it needs to work 
with the third party to make sure the following is achieved: 
 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mr P towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr P which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr P originally made the payments, to the 
date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding loans, 
and treat any repayments made by Mr P as though they had been repayments of the 
principal on all outstanding loans. 
If this results in Mr P having made overpayments then Sunny should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date the 
overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. 
Sunny should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus, 
then the surplus should be paid to Mr P. However, if there is still an outstanding balance 
then Sunny should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr P. 
E) The number of loans taken from loan 12 onwards means any information recorded about 
them is adverse. So, all entries about loans 12 to 28 should be removed from Mr Ps credit 
file. Sunny does not have to remove loans 24, 27 and 28 from Mr Ps credit file until these 
have been repaid, but any adverse information recorded about these loans should still be 
removed.                                                                                                                                * HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
If after doing the above Mr P still has an outstanding balance due, then Sunny should try and 
work together to come to a mutually agreeable repayment plan with Mr P in order to repay 
what is owed. But Id remind Sunny of its obligation to treat Mr P fairly. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Ps complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 July 2020.
