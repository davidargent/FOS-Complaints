The complaint
O complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) restricted pay-outs from its 
account.
What happened
O had had an account with PayPal for its trading for ten years or so. It had a restriction of 
£300  whereby payments to O were limited to £300 each month. Above that figure, O had 
to wait for 21 days to receive money for its sales.
O complained. It said the limit was restrictive and hurt its cashflow. It said that PayPal told it 
in a webchat that it was because Os sales turnover had gone up  when it had gone down. 
O showed us sales figures to confirm that.
PayPal said (in their final response) that the restriction for O was set at £1,800. So O could 
draw up to £1,800 each calendar month. And above that, O had to wait for 21 days. PayPal 
said this was common industry practice and was in place to ensure there was enough 
money to meet chargebacks or disputes. 
PayPal also said it was in their user agreement. PayPal said the restriction could be avoided 
by using one of their shipping carriers and adding the tracking details on the PayPal activity 
page  then funds could be released in one day; or ask buyers to confirm receipt and then 
funds would be released instantly. PayPal showed how to do that in the app. PayPal also 
said O could request an increase in its release limit and described how to do that.
O brought its complaint to us. Our investigator put it to PayPal that Os limit was £300  not 
£1,800 and Os turnover had gone down, not up. PayPal accepted theyd made an error and 
offered compensation of £200.
O didnt accept this and asked that its complaint is referred to an ombudsman  so it has 
come to me to make a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
We cant tell businesses to change their operations, processes, or procedures  thats up to 
them, and we cant interfere. But our role is to decide if customers have been treated fairly in 
the circumstances of their complaint.
PayPal has the right to withhold some funds  to ensure there is money to meet any 
chargebacks or disputes. PayPal have said that this is standard industry practice  and I 
think thats a reasonable point for PayPal to make. O argue theyve not had any disputes in 
the ten years theyve been trading through PayPal  and I accept that, but I still dont think 
they could expect (for example) a zero restriction. 
I looked at PayPals terms and conditions, and  as PayPal quoted in their final response, 
they do have the right to withhold funds. The User Agreement says: Under certain 
circumstances, in order to protect PayPal and the security and integrity of the network of 
buyers and sellers that use the PayPal services, PayPal may take account-level or 
transaction-level actionsTo request information in connection with an account limitation, 
hold or reserve, you should visit the Resolution Centre or follow the instructions in our email 
notice with respect to the limitation, hold or reserve. You acknowledge and agree that any 
funds held under this user agreement may be placed in your reserve account and that you 
will provide to us any information as we may reasonably request to allow us to determine 
whether the risk has passed.
I considered what PayPal said in their final response about Os limit  they said it was 
£1,800. But O showed us evidence it was £300. So - PayPal made an error here. But 
equally, PayPal also made some practical suggestions about how O could get its money 
faster -  which I think was helpful.
Also, during our investigation, PayPal said theyd reviewed Os account and (in January 
2023) made the decision to increase its restriction limit to USD2,000. That should, by now, 
be in place for O to use  I hope that is helpful to O.
PayPal accept they made an error in their final response about Os limit and offered 
compensation of £200. I think that was a reasonable thing for PayPal to do. And I agree with 
our investigator that PayPal should pay that amount to O.
I know that O didnt accept that to be a fair outcome - but in the circumstances of this 
complaint, I think it is  and therefore Im not asking PayPal to do any more than that.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA must:
Pay compensation of £200 to O.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask O to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 March 2023.
