The complaint
Ms R complains about extensive delays to her application to remortgage a buy to let (BTL) 
property with National Westminster Bank Plc, when she first applied for a BTL mortgage 
then for a residential mortgage. She wanted NatWest to refund additional interest shed paid.
What happened
Ms R said she knew the current fixed interest rate was coming to an end, on the mortgage 
for one of her many BTL properties. So she told us she applied, in good time, for a new BTL 
mortgage with NatWest. Ms R complains about the extensive delays she experienced when 
trying to arrange a new mortgage.
Ms R said NatWest had offered her £200, but she wanted it to pay £2,276.10 to cover the full
value of all the additional mortgage payments she had to pay because of NatWests delays, 
plus compensation for her wasted time in trying to do what should have been a simple 
remortgage.
NatWest accepted it had caused some delays in this process, as it had been quite busy
during this time. But it said Ms R had changed from a BTL application to a residential
mortgage application, which did mean it had to start the process again. NatWest offered to
pay Ms R £200 for its part in the delays shed experienced, and for some poor service.
Our investigator set out her understanding of what had happened. She thought Ms R started
her application in May. Some appointments with NatWests mortgage advisors couldnt go
ahead because Ms R hadnt uploaded documents in time. Our investigator understood
NatWest was ready to offer Ms R a BTL mortgage in July 2021, subject to a survey which
unfortunately couldnt be done until August. But Ms R then decided she wanted a different
sort of mortgage, for residential property instead of rental, which meant NatWest would need
different information. This application was later withdrawn.
Our investigator said NatWest had upheld Ms Rs complaint in terms of service, and didnt
dispute that she faced some delays. But our investigator thought the £200 which NatWest
had offered was enough to reflect the service which Ms R received, including the delay in
arranging mortgage appointments and the change in advisers.
Ms R didnt agree. She said we hadnt looked at all of the facts. She wanted us to contact a
specific advisor, who she said would tell us what a shambles the whole process was.
Ms R said shed first contacted NatWest in March to arrange an appointment. Ms R said
shed spoken to numerous mortgage advisors, and did upload her information quickly to
NatWests online document management system. She said it was later, after shed been told
that a residential application would process faster, that further mistakes were made.
Ms R said NatWest had acknowledged it made a mistake about her income for a residential
mortgage. She said the valuation was also done on the wrong basis, and that caused further
delays. She said shed sent a spreadsheet at the start setting out full details of her rental
properties, so that, and her other mortgage applications in previous years, meant NatWest 
and its underwriters had everything they needed.
Ms R sent us a number of further documents. She said she wanted her complaint to be
considered by an ombudsman, so it was passed to me for a final decision. I then reached my 
provisional decision on this case.
My provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint and explained why I only proposed to 
uphold it in part. This is what I said then: 
There remains some dispute in this case about what happened, and when. So Ill set out 
what I think has happened. 
I think Ms R first contacted NatWest to arrange the remortgage of one of her buy to let 
properties in May 2021. Ms R has told us more recently that she was in touch with 
NatWest as early as March 2021, but I havent been able to see any evidence that shed 
tried to book a mortgage appointment in March. And in her complaint emails to NatWest, 
she said shed been trying to remortgage since May. I think her recollection closer to the 
time is more likely to be accurate.
Ms R wanted to secure a remortgage to follow closely on from the end of her existing 
fixed rate deal. That appears to have finished at the end of July. Ms R was given an 
appointment for 15 June, but this meeting appears to have been arranged at quite short 
notice, and Ms R hadnt had time to upload the required documents to NatWests online 
system. So this meeting didnt go ahead. I dont think thats NatWests fault, although I 
accept that given the timescales, it may not have been Ms Rs fault either.
Ms R called NatWest on 15 June, as she was trying to complete her remortgage online 
instead of waiting for another appointment. I understand that Ms R wasnt able to apply 
for a BTL remortgage online, because of the number of buy to let properties she has. 
NatWest prefers to speak to customers like Ms R directly. I think thats reasonable, as 
the issues and risks for NatWest are different when someone has a larger rental 
property portfolio.
Ms R says NatWest should have been clear with her that she wouldnt be able to do an 
online application, because of the number of properties she has. Im aware that Ms R 
had already told NatWest how many properties she had, at this stage. But I think that on 
15 June, Ms R was just having a very general conversation about how to apply online. 
So I dont think its reasonable to expect the advisor she spoke to about her online 
application to have been aware of the number of properties she had, and to have 
advised her she wouldnt be able to complete an online application.
I think its clear from this call that Ms R was also very frustrated at having to supply 
documents to NatWest that she didnt think it really needed, and that she didnt want to 
have to give NatWest information she thought it already had. Ms R said shed done a 
couple of mortgage applications the year before, so she thought NatWest already had 
almost everything it needed.
I think its reasonable for NatWest to ask for up to date documentation for Ms Rs new 
mortgage application. And, although Ms R said NatWest didnt need income information 
because her rental income is paid into its account, NatWest has pointed out that it wont 
know how much of this is profit for Ms R. So I dont think it would be reasonable to expect NatWest to rely solely on the information it already had from Ms Rs accounts 
with it. 
Ms R also said she had sent a spreadsheet detailing all of her rental properties to 
NatWest at the start. But, whilst this may well have provided a useful overview for 
NatWest, I would also not expect it to accept this as the sole evidence of Ms Rs 
income, expenditure and overall profit from each property. So again, I think it was 
reasonable for NatWest to ask for more, to validate what Ms R had said.
I understand Ms R had another appointment on 18 June, and that this was also 
cancelled because NatWest didnt feel it had sufficient documentation to go ahead. The 
advisor who was working with Ms R at this time said Ms R had emailed a considerable 
number of documents to her, rather than uploading those to NatWests online document 
management system. And the advisor said Ms R sent screenshots of her statements, 
which couldnt be accepted because they didnt include her name and account details. 
So NatWest couldnt validate these. It couldnt be sure they were Ms Rs statements.
Ive already said I do think it was reasonable for NatWest to request up to date 
information from Ms R. I also think its reasonable for NatWest to request that this 
information is supplied through its online document management system, and that 
documents are supplied in advance of a mortgage application meeting. And I think its 
reasonable for NatWest to say these documents must show full name and account 
details, so they can be validated. 
I do think there have been considerable delays in getting Ms R through the mortgage 
application process with NatWest. But I think that a significant amount of these delays 
have been as a result of difficulties that Ms R has found both in collecting the required 
information, and in working with NatWests online document management system. I 
havent been able to see that those difficulties are NatWests fault.
Ms R then booked another appointment for 7 July. This appointment was cancelled. 
Again, this seems to have been as a result of difficulties Ms R had in uploading 
documents, and NatWests advisor says that he spent time on 7 July supporting Ms R to 
work with the online document management system.
I should note here that we do have evidence from the specific advisor Ms R asked us to 
contact. He has provided detailed input into NatWests response to Ms Rs complaint.
Ms R booked another appointment for 12 July. This appointment went ahead, and Ms 
Rs BTL mortgage application then appeared to be proceeding. An appointment was 
booked for a BTL valuation of her property, on 11 August. I know this didnt happen as 
quickly as Ms R would have liked. NatWest has told us it was very busy with mortgage 
appointments at this time, so it seems likely that surveyors would also be equally busy. I 
havent seen anything to make me think that NatWest had delayed this appointment.
Ms R didnt receive a mortgage offer following this appointment and the survey. I think 
this is likely to be because shed already told NatWest that she wanted to change the 
mortgage type. The advisor who spoke to her on 12 July said Ms R wanted to explore 
this option. 
Ms R told us she had decided she wanted to proceed with a residential mortgage 
application instead, because NatWest told her that would be quicker. And she told us 
she had planned to move into the property. But the advisor Ms R spoke to on 12 July 
said something different.She said Ms R had been surprised and disappointed at the BTL rates NatWest could 
offer her, and had referred to seeing better rates online. That advisor said these were 
residential rates. Ms R said in response to this that it was possible her daughter would 
move into the property instead, so she might want a residential mortgage instead.
It doesnt appear, from the advisors evidence, as if Ms R had been clear at the time on 
how she might want to proceed. So I dont think it was unreasonable for NatWest to go 
ahead with the BTL mortgage application that Ms R had submitted.
I can see that Ms R emailed NatWest in mid-August to say shed just found out the 
survey that had been completed was a BTL survey. Ms R queried why that had gone 
ahead, when shed discussed providing tax returns for the purposes of a residential 
mortgage. I think that was because Ms Rs plans werent clear, at the time of the 12 July 
appointment. I havent seen anything to make me think that Ms Rs BTL application 
should have been withdrawn by NatWest at that stage.
Ms R refers in her emails to being asked to do an up to date tax return for a meeting on 
24 August, and I can see she had an appointment booked for this time, so it seems 
likely that this was to discuss a residential mortgage. But this appointment was 
cancelled. It seems likely that this is because Ms R hadnt uploaded her documents in 
advance. She emailed NatWest on 24 August to say that shed only done her tax return 
the day before, and had supplied some information once that was done, but her tax 
assessment doesnt appear to have been processed in time for this meeting.
I do think its most likely Ms R had been made aware by this time that documents 
needed to be uploaded well in advance of a mortgage application appointment. So I 
dont think its NatWests fault that this meeting didnt go ahead.
By 15 September, Ms R had uploaded further documents. On 16 September, she was 
trying to complete her application online, but wasnt able to. Ms R said she was advised 
to try this by NatWest, but it wasnt actually possible. I can see NatWest emailed Ms R 
on 17 September to say a fresh application would be needed, she couldnt convert an 
existing application to a different mortgage type. So I think it is likely that Ms R was 
given incorrect information about whether she could do her application online at this 
point, and that may have wasted some of her time on 16 September.
NatWest accepts that it did cause a delay with her application at this point, because it 
processed her residential mortgage application including income from the property that 
she was planning to stop letting out. There was then some difficulty internally in winding 
back from this position and reconsidering Ms Rs application on the basis of a revised 
income assessment. I think this caused a delay of around four weeks, which is a little 
longer than NatWest suggested. I also think NatWest is responsible for that delay. Ill 
bear that in mind when I think about compensation in this case.
Ms R said she initially offered to show NatWest her full tax return for 20/21, but was told 
it wasnt needed. But she said when NatWest reconsidered her application, it decided it 
did want this after all. I have seen an email dated 19 October, where NatWest asks Ms 
R to resubmit documents she has previously supplied, because the lapse of time meant 
her payslips would no longer show her most recent payments. It also said that during 
this lapse of time since her last meeting, its policy had changed, and it now needed to 
see a full tax return.
Ive noted that this lapse of time between Ms Rs appointments was NatWests fault, so I 
think its NatWests fault that Ms R was then asked to resubmit documentation.I also note that although NatWest has repeatedly requested documents be uploaded to 
its online document management system 48 hours before any mortgage appointment 
meeting, it only gave Ms R a days notice of the new documents it wanted her to upload 
for the meeting on 20 October. Ms Rs email to NatWest suggests that she only found 
out about the new requirement for full tax returns because she had contacted NatWest, 
and asked it to check (insisting the advisor speak directly to an underwriter) whether or 
not this document would be needed. The late timing of this emailed request for extra 
documents does, in my view, tend to support what Ms R has said about this.
So I think this is poor service by NatWest. I note that it was at this point that Ms R 
cancelled her application altogether, and submitted a complaint.
I know that NatWest wasnt always able to arrange mortgage appointments at short 
notice. But I do think that the initial delays in this case were caused mainly by Ms Rs 
difficulties in uploading documents to NatWests online document management system, 
and her unhappiness about supplying details which she considered NatWest would 
already hold. Ive said that I dont think either of those things were NatWests fault.
I also think there was then some confusion about what sort of mortgage Ms R wanted, 
and initial residential mortgage applications also seem to have been cancelled because 
the required documentation for a residential mortgage hadnt been supplied by Ms R. 
But, on or around 16 September, Ms R does appear to have settled on making a 
residential mortgage application. NatWest has accepted responsibility for a mistake over 
her income at this point. Its also said it had difficulty getting its underwriters to 
reconsider, which caused a delay.
I think this delay ran up until Ms Rs further appointment on 20 October. I think that the 
request for up to date documents that Ms R received on 19 October was only necessary 
because of the delay NatWest had already caused. And I accept that Ms R would not 
have received this request at all, if she hadnt made further enquiries herself.
So I do think the later stages of Ms Rs mortgage application, and particularly her 
residential mortgage application, did represent poor service to Ms R. NatWest has 
offered £200 for delays and poor service. But I think it should pay a little more than this. 
I think NatWest should pay £350 in compensation.
Im aware that Ms R was paying significantly more for her mortgage during this time, 
and I know she wanted NatWest to pay that additional amount. But I have to bear in 
mind that its not clear, if Ms Rs second mortgage application had progressed without 
delay, that this would have suited Ms R in the medium or longer term. It seems as if Ms 
R then changed her mind about moving into the property, as the address she gave our 
service recently also seems to be where she was living when she made these 
applications to NatWest. So it seems as if the delay to arranging her residential 
mortgage may also have meant, fortuitously, that Ms R wasnt left with a mortgage 
which would have prevented her continued letting of this property, once shed decided 
not to move in herself.
I invited the parties to make any final points, if they wanted, before issuing my final decision. 
Both sides replied.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.NatWest replied to say that it wanted to comment on two specific areas of my decision. The 
first was when Ms R became aware that she needed to supply tax returns for NatWest. 
NatWest said Ms R was aware on 12 July 2021, when she first discussed a residential 
mortgage instead of a BTL mortgage, that she would need a new tax return, because her 
previous years tax return didnt show affordability for a residential mortgage. Her next two 
appointments, on 21 July and 24 August, were cancelled because she hadnt uploaded 
those documents. When her residential mortgage appointment was rebooked on 14 October 
2021, her SA100 tax return was requested for the appointment. So NatWest said these 
documents werent requested at late notice, Ms R should have been aware for some time 
that these were needed.
NatWest acknowledged that its advisor had told Ms R that this was a change to its 
procedures, but it said that it has always been a requirement for self-employed mortgage 
applicants to provide this information.
Ms Rs complaint to NatWest refers to having been asked to provide SA302s, not SA100s. 
But I can see that the advisors email to Ms R refers specifically to SA100s, and these are 
the documents that Ms R was asked to upload onto NatWests online document 
management system. There are a number of previous requests for Tax Calculation and 
Tax Overview. For those reasons, I do now think it is likely Ms R was already aware that 
NatWest would like to see a tax return document from her, when the advisor emailed to ask 
for an SA100. However, I note that previous requests dont use the HMRC form number, and 
Ms R said this made the document requests confusing. I also note that NatWests advisor 
specifically told Ms R that its requirements had changed. NatWest itself says it doesnt know 
why that was done. So I still think this represents poor service from NatWest in the later 
stages of Ms Rs mortgage application, although not in the way I had initially concluded. This 
doesnt change my overall conclusion on this complaint.
The second finding NatWest wanted to challenge was the length of the delay I thought 
NatWest was responsible for. NatWest said Ms R requested a change to a residential 
mortgage on 16 September 2021, and on 17 September the mortgage underwriters 
confirmed that a new residential application would be needed. NatWests advisor has told us 
that getting this exception agreed took around three weeks. NatWest took issue with my 
suggestion that this caused a delay of four weeks.
I do still think the delay caused here was of four weeks. I have seen an email which said that 
the exception Ms R needed for her residential mortgage application to proceed was in place 
by 13 October, but Ms R had then gone on holiday, and an appointment couldnt be booked 
until the following week. I do think Ms R had started this application in good time before her 
holiday, and I think NatWest is then responsible for the delay that then ran into her holiday 
period. So I think it is NatWest, not Ms R, that is responsible for the extra delay caused by 
the exemption she needed not being resolved until she was on holiday. 
NatWest said it thought its previous offer of £200 was appropriate, and pointed to areas 
where I found it had behaved reasonably. However, Ive explained above why I havent 
changed my mind in response to NatWests arguments. I still think NatWest provided Ms R 
with poor service in the later stages of her mortgage application, and that a payment of £350 
is the right amount to provide a fair and reasonable outcome to this complaint. 
Ms R also replied to disagree with my provisional decision. She said she didnt think I had 
ascertained what had actually happened. She asked me to obtain further emails from 
NatWest, and to ask it for recordings of all the calls she had with its advisors. Our service does have documentation from NatWest, and I requested additional 
documentation in order to formulate my provisional decision. In addition, our service has 
requested all the recordings of calls with Ms R that NatWest held between May 2021 and 
January 2022. NatWest has sent us what it has, and has explained it doesnt have 
recordings of all the calls that Ms R made. (I also note, for completeness, that NatWest 
refers in its own internal emails to not being able to retrieve recordings of all Ms Rs calls.) 
I do think I have sufficient documentation to resolve this complaint.
Ms R complained that I hadnt referred to advisors by name, so she said it wasnt clear which 
advisor I was referring to. I dont think its appropriate to refer to advisors by name in my 
decision, for broadly the same reasons as our service refers to Ms R by her initial only. 
Instead I have sought to set out the dates of Ms Rs appointments so that she can locate the 
events Im referring to. 
Ms R said she had some difficulties uploading documents at some stages but actually all 
those difficulties were due to NatWests document management system, and she said she 
had emails to prove this. I was aware when I wrote my provisional decision of the difficulties 
Ms R reported, and I do accept that this system didnt always work seamlessly. But it 
appears from Ms Rs emails that she was not uploading documents 48 hours before her 
appointment. I think that, rather than the occasional problem with the online system, is the 
core reason why a number of appointments didnt go ahead.
Ms R said that she sent a summary property spreadsheet at the beginning of the process. I 
understand Ms R saw this spreadsheet as key to her applications. But I still think that it was 
reasonable for NatWest to ask Ms R to show her bank statements and other independent 
validation of the information on that spreadsheet. 
Ms R also said she had a lengthy phone call with an advisor about this spreadsheet, 
showing her where these figures could be found. She wanted to know why we hadnt 
listened to that call. Ive explained that NatWest no longer has this call recording. 
Ms R insisted that all necessary documents were uploaded. But I have seen emails to Ms R, 
saying that appointments were cancelled because she hadnt uploaded documents. So I still 
think that was the case.
Ms R stressed how much of her time this took up. She said it was making her ill. She told us 
that NatWest had done the same before, and it had to pay her compensation that time for 
the extra mortgage costs she incurred. I have considered how much of Ms Rs time these 
applications have taken, in deciding an appropriate award in this case. But I dont think 
NatWest has to pay her additional mortgage costs now, just because it has done so before. 
Ms R objected to being asked for tax returns. She said she had asked exactly why NatWest 
needed tax returns and what those returns would show that it couldnt already see from her 
bank statements and salary slips. But she never received any answer. She said that was 
because there was no logical reason for requesting tax returns. 
I dont agree that NatWest had no reason to request tax returns. I dont think NatWest can 
tell, every time Ms R makes a purchase using her bank account, whether that is for a tax 
deductible expense or not. And even if it was able to tell whether purchases were likely to be 
tax deductible, I dont think its reasonable to expect NatWest to work out Ms Rs profits, 
when that information is available on tax returns. 
Ms R said she was told to do her residential application online, when this wasnt suitable for 
her. I have accepted that this may well have wasted some of Ms Rs time on 16 September.Ms R also said her decision to change to a residential application was only taken because 
she was fed up with how long the BTL application was taking, and she had understood a 
residential mortgage application would be much quicker. She said her daughter had thought 
of moving into the property at the time, although Ms R does now have a BTL mortgage with 
a different bank. So it seems likely that a residential mortgage would not, in fact, have suited 
Ms R. 
I explained in my provisional decision that this does impact on the outcome of this complaint. 
It does look as if the delay to arranging her residential mortgage may also have meant, 
fortuitously, that Ms R wasnt left with a mortgage which would have prevented her continued 
letting of this property, once shed decided that she wasnt going to use it for residential 
purposes, but would continue to rent it out for profit. So Ms R was able to continue to benefit 
from the income from this property, which I would anticipate would not have been possible if 
her residential mortgage application had been completed. 
Ive considered the further arguments that both sides have provided in response to my 
provisional decision. But I havent changed my mind on the appropriate outcome in this 
case. So Ill now make the award I originally proposed. 
My final decision
My final decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must pay Ms R £350 in 
compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms R to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 November 2022.
