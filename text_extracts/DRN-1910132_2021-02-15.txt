The complaint
Mr L is unhappy that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA, didnt reimburse him an amount of 
money under their seller protection scheme.
What happened
Mr L sold an item online and received payment via his PayPal account. After Mr L had 
received the money, the buyer asked Mr L to post the item to a different address than the 
one stated on the buyers account. Mr L agreed to this request and posted the item to the 
address requested.
A few days later, Mr L noticed that the money he had received for the item had been 
reimbursed to the buyer. Mr L contacted PayPal about this and was told that the buyer had 
reported that the payment was unauthorised, and that PayPal had accepted this claim and 
had reimbursed the money to the buyers account because of this.
So, Mr L found himself in the position of having dispatched the item but not having received 
any money for it. PayPal looked into what had happened to see whether Mr L qualified for a 
reimbursement of the money under their seller protection scheme. But, because one of the 
criteria for the seller protection scheme was that the item needed to have been dispatched to 
the address on the buyers account  which hadnt happened in this case  PayPal said that 
Mr L wasnt eligible for a reimbursement under their scheme.
Mr L wasnt happy and so he made a complaint. PayPal looked at Mr Ls complaint, but they 
confirmed that the transaction didnt qualify for reimbursement under the seller protection 
scheme, so they didnt uphold the complaint. However, PayPal did acknowledge that they 
hadnt provided Mr L with the level of service during the complaint process that they would 
have liked, and made an offer of £100 to Mr L by way of an apology because of this.
Mr L wasnt satisfied with PayPals response, so he referred his complaint to this service. 
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. But they felt it had been appropriate for 
PayPal to decline Mr Ls claim under the seller protection scheme, and they felt that the offer 
of compensation that PayPal had made was a fair one. So, they also didnt uphold the 
complaint.
Mr L remained dissatisfied, and so the matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
To begin Ill state that I sympathise with Mr Ls position here, and I can understand why he 
might be frustrated with what he must feel is a refusal of PayPal to reimburse him when it 
appears that he may have been the victim of a scam. 
However, the scope of this complaint doesnt cover the broader issue at hand here, but 
rather is focussed on whether PayPal should reimburse Mr L under the seller protection 
scheme as he wants them too. So, what I must decide is whether PayPal have acted unfairly 
or unreasonably in declining Mr Ls claim under the scheme, based on all the relevant 
circumstances here  and ultimately, I cant say that they have.
I say this because the conditions of the seller protection scheme confirm that, in order for a 
payment to qualify, the item sold must have been dispatched to the buyers address as it is 
listed on the buyers account. And, because this wasnt the case in this instance, the 
transaction doesnt qualify for seller protection, as per the conditions and requirements of the 
seller protections scheme.
This means that I cant fairly censure PayPal for not making a reimbursement to Mr L under 
that scheme.
Mr L has also expressed his dissatisfaction that he has had to spend considerable time 
contacting PayPal about this and has appealed PayPals decision on several occasions to 
no avail. PayPal have acknowledged previously to Mr L that the level of service that they 
provided wasnt to the standard that they would have liked and offered Mr L a payment of 
£100 because of this.
I think that this is a fair outcome here, and I wont be asking PayPal to take any further action 
beyond honouring this offer - if they have not already done so. 
I understand that Mr L doesnt think that this amount is commensurate for the amount of time 
that he has had to spend on this issue. However, it must be noted that Mr L has repeatedly 
appealed a decision from PayPal which I can only conclude was a decision that it was 
appropriate for PayPal to have made, and so it wouldnt be reasonable for me to ask PayPal 
to compensate Mr L further because of this.  
I realise that this wont be the outcome that Mr L was wanting, and I hope that he is able to 
resolve this issue via alternative channels. But I hope that he can understand, considering all 
that I have explained above, why I wont be upholding this complaint or asking PayPal to 
take any further action at this time. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 March 2021.
