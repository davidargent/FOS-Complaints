The complaint
Mr W complains that Standard Life Assurance Limited (SL) delayed his requested switch to 
cash in his Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP). He says this led to a financial loss of 
around £8,000.
What happened
Mr W has a SIPP with SL. It was invested in two different funds until March 2020. Mr W 
received an annual statement from SL dated 8 March 2020. This showed a total fund value 
of £62,424.45 in the SIPP at that date. 
Mr W said that after he received his statement he called SL on 12 March 2020. He named 
the SL employee that he spoke to. He said that during this call, he asked for his investments 
to be switched to cash due to the impact of the coronavirus on the financial markets.
SL said they had no record of Mr W calling them on 12 March 2020. They said that he had 
called them on 17 March 2020. They said he requested the switch to cash during that call.
SL said that they sent Mr W a letter on 23 March 2020 which said that the transaction date 
for the requested switch to cash was 23 March 2020 for both funds. And the settlement date 
for the cash was 27 March 2020. 
Mr W said that he didnt receive confirmation from SL that his funds had been switched to 
cash until August 2020, after hed written to them several times for that information. In their 
letter dated 29 July 2020, SL acknowledged Mr Ws earlier requests for confirmation. And 
confirmed when his investments had been sold to cash. 
SL wrote to Mr W again on 18 August 2020. They confirmed the value of his SIPP on 18 
August 2020 was £54,011.79. And explained what he would have to do if he wanted to re-
start his investments. They also said that they were legally unable to give Mr W any financial 
advice. 
Mr W called SL on 24 August 2020. He wanted to know why he hadnt had any updates 
about the value of his SIPP. He said hed received a letter saying his SIPP was only worth 
£54,011.79. But that it should be worth £62,000.
SL wrote to Mr W after this call. They said hed asked them to sell his two investments on 17 
March 2020. And that theyd sent his contract notes on 23 March 2020. They said that his 
SIPP was now fully in cash.
Mr W complained to SL on 21 November 2020. He felt that theyd taken too long to switch 
his investments to cash. He said hed requested the switch to cash on 12 March 2020 by 
phone. He also wanted to know why he hadnt had the switch confirmed until August 2020. 
SL issued their final response on the complaint on 25 January 2021. They didnt consider 
that theyd done anything wrong. They said theyd been unable to find any record of a phone 
call on 12 March 2020. But that theyd listened to the call of 17 March 2020. They felt that Mr 
W had given the instruction to switch to cash during this call. They confirmed that the 
investments had been sold to cash as instructed and that the sales completed on 27 March 
2020. SL said that theyd followed their process correctly. They didnt agree that Mr W had 
suffered a financial loss as they felt he was in the position he shouldve been in.
Mr W didnt agree with SL. He said that his first sale instruction had been given during a call 
on 12 March 2020. And that hed made the call on 17 March 2020 to ask for confirmation 
that his wishes of his first call had been carried out. 
Unhappy with their response, Mr W brought his complaint to this service. He felt it was 
suspicious that SL couldnt find a record of the call hed made on 12 March 2020. He also 
said that even if he had asked to sell on 17 March 2020, which he hadnt, it wouldve still 
taken too long to process his request. He also couldnt remember speaking to the person SL 
said hed spoken to on 17 March 2020. 
Our investigator didnt consider that the complaint should be upheld. He said hed listened to 
the call from 17 March 2020. And that during that call, Mr W had made no reference to a 
previous call having been made on 12 March 2020. Or to a previous instruction to switch to 
cash. Our investigator said that during the call on 17 March 2020, SL had told Mr W that the 
switch could take up to five working days. And that Mr Ws investments had been sold within 
five working days of his instruction. He also said that SL had used the correct address for the 
contract note, which wouldve informed Mr W about the sale if he had received it. As he 
couldnt verify the discussions that had taken place between Mr W and SL on 12 March 
2020, and given the content of the call on 17 March 2020, he felt there was no evidence that 
Mr W had given the sale instruction before 17 March 2020. Therefore he felt SL hadnt 
delayed the sale to cash. 
As agreement couldnt be reached, the complaint has come to me for a review.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not going to uphold it. I dont consider that SL caused delays after Mr W 
gave them a sale instruction. And Im satisfied that they confirmed that the sale had 
concluded in their 23 March 2020 contract note. I understand this will be disappointing to Mr 
W. Ill explain the reasons for my decision.
I first considered if I had any evidence  other that Mr Ws testimony  that he made a 
request to sell his investments before 17 March 2020. 
I listened to the 17 March 2020 call. At the start of the call, Mr W asked to speak to the 
named person he said hed spoken to on 12 March 2020. He said that this person had been 
looking into some information for him and he was wondering if it might be better for me to 
withhold my investments and re-invest in six months. I consider that this indicates that Mr W 
was still considering his options. And that he hadnt yet decided to switch to cash. 
Later on in the 17 March 2020 call, SL said to Mr W: you were sort of not sure what might 
be the best action for your plan?. Mr W replied: Im in two minds. Whether to stop it while 
this coronavirus is going on. I could lose money on it, couldnt I?. After this exchange, SL 
gave Mr W the options available to him. He said he didnt know what to do. SL agreed that 
Mr W could move to cash for now and reinvest at a later date. They told him that they could 
take his instruction to sell his investments by phone. And said that it would take up to five 
days to action his request.I acknowledge that Mr W is adamant that he made his switch request during an earlier call. 
He has asked this service if we asked SL if they employed the named individual he said he 
spoke to on 12 March 2020 on their phone answering system. He said that his call of 17 
March 2020 was to confirm that his investments had in fact been stopped. He queried why 
he wouldve asked for the named individual on the 17 March 2020 call unless hed spoken to 
her previously. 
Im not questioning that Mr W made a call on 12 March 2020. I agree its likely that he spoke 
to the named individual he mentioned at some point. But theres no point during the 17 
March 2020 call that Mr W indicated hed already decided to switch his investments to cash. 
Or that he had previously called SL to request that his investments be sold. And he doesnt 
ask SL during the 17 March 2020 call to confirm that his investments had in fact been 
stopped, which he told this service was the purpose of that call. So it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable for me to accept that Mr W made a sale instruction to the named individual he 
said hed spoken to on 12 March 2020. I say that given the content of the 17 March 2020 
call. 
I next considered whether SL acted fairly and reasonably when it took them four working 
days to set up the sale instruction.
SL told Mr W in the 17 March 2020 phone call that his request would take up to five days to 
process. They didnt specify this meant business days, but I consider that it is reasonable to 
assume that to be the case for financial transactions. The transactions were carried out four 
working days after Mr Ws request, on 23 March 2020. It then took a few days for the trades 
to complete. 
From what Ive seen, SL followed their correct process to carry out Mr Ws instruction. Ive 
found no evidence that they delayed the process.
I next considered if SL provided confirmation  in a timely manner - that Mr Ws sale 
instructions had been followed. 
Ive seen the contract note dated 23 March 2020, which confirmed that Mr Ws investments 
were sold on 23 March 2020 and settled on 27 March 2020. The address on the contract 
note is the same address that was successfully used on the 8 March 2020 annual statement, 
and all other letters Ive seen. 
From what Ive seen, SL issued the confirmation of the sale in a timely manner. So, although 
its unfortunate that Mr W didnt receive the confirmation of his sale instruction nearer the 
time of the sale, I cant reasonably hold SL responsible for that.
I acknowledge that Mr W attempted to take action to ensure that the value of his SIPP didnt 
go down due to the impact of coronavirus. But Ive no evidence that SL have done anything 
wrong. I dont uphold the complaint. Im satisfied that 17 March 2020 was the first date that 
Mr W gave the sell instruction. Im not persuaded that SL caused delays after Mr W 
instructed them to sell his investments to cash. And Im satisfied that SL did write to him in a 
timely fashion to confirm that the sales had completed. Therefore I dont uphold the 
complaint. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint. Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 October 2022.
