K821x#15complaint
Ms D says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading  as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly 
lent to her. Ms D has said her financial situation wasnt fully assessed and short-term lending  
wasnt suitable for her. 
background
This complaint is about one running  credit facility followed  by 35 short-term  loans (Ill refer to 
them all as loans in this decision and have numbered them for ease of reference) Sunny 
provided to Ms D between  July 2014  and March  2019. Ms Ds borrowing history is attached 
as an appendix  to this decision.  
Our adjudicator partially upheld Ms Ds complaint.  They  said that within  the borrowing there 
were three chains  loans  one to 11, loan 12 and then loans 13 to 36. Our adjudicator 
thought loans five to 11 and 18 to 36 shouldnt have been given.  And they also thought the 
information about those loans had an adverse  impact on Ms Ds credit  file so all information 
about them  should be removed. 
Sunny didnt agree but it did offer to partially uphold the complaint from loan 19 onwards. We 
put the offer to Ms D, but she didnt accept  it and asked for her complaint  to be passed  to an 
ombudsman for a decision.
While the complaint was waiting  to be allocated to an ombudsman  another of adjudicators  
reconsidered the case and came to a different conclusion. She thought there  were  only two 
chains to be considered, loans  one to 12 and then loans 13 to 36. She concluded that for the 
running credit facility (loan 1) any drawdowns  from December 2014  shouldnt have been 
given. And she further thought loans two to 12 and loans 20 to 36 shouldnt have been 
given. With reference  to Ms Ds credit  file she said only adverse information about the 
borrowing for the drawdown (loan one) from December  2014 onwards and loans two to five 
should be removed.  But that all information  about  loans  6 to 12 and loans 20 to 36 was 
adverse and should be removed. 
Both parties  have been made  aware of this proposed change  in outcome. 
As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms D could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN44616652But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Ms D could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course,  the loan payments being  affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ms D didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that part of the running credit borrowing  
(up until December 2014) and loans 13 to 19 shouldnt be upheld. Because of this, I dont 
think there is any ongoing disagreement  about  these loans. So, I wont be making a decision 
about this lending. But the loans  were part of the borrowing relationship Ms D had with 
Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ds complaint. After doing so Im going  to uphold the 
complaint in part. Ill explain why. 
Loan one  running credit facility
Ms Ds first borrowing was a running  credit facility which she took in July 2014 with a limit of 
£750. Ms D made two drawdowns in July totalling  £175 which  she repaid on 26 July. She 
then came back for more  borrowing in August  with six drawdowns totalling  £375 which  was 
repaid on 22 August.  Ms D made a further four drawdowns in September  for £475 and 
repaid that borrowing on 25 September. This pattern continued  with six drawdowns totalling 
Ref: DRN44616653£375 taken in October and repaid, and seven drawdowns totalling £450  in November and 
repaid. 
Like the adjudicator,  I think  the pattern of borrowing on a monthly or batch basis, repaying  
and then returning for more borrowing was most likely an indication that Ms D was coming 
back to help cover the shortfall left in her finances after repaying  the previous loans. The 
amounts being  borrowed  generally  increased each month  as did the number of times  she 
returned for more  borrowing within the month. So, I think by the 26th drawdown, at the 
beginning of December,  there was sufficient  evidence  to suggest that Ms D was struggling 
with her finances and was becoming  persistently reliant upon  the borrowing. 
So, I dont think Sunny should  have  allowed any further borrowing  from the beginning of 
December 2014  at the 26th drawdown.  
Loans two to twelve
The running credit facility (loan 1) was repaid on 26 December 2014 and no more  
drawdowns were allowed.  But this was followed two weeks later by Ms D being  given an 
instalment loan which effectively had the same impact as allowing her the previous further 
drawdowns on the running  credit facility. Ms D was clearly having problems managing her 
money, so I dont think further borrowing was fair. 
Looking at Ms Ds borrowing behaviour  from loan two onwards it would suggest  Ms D was 
juggling her finances. She was given loan two on 8 January 2015 for £400 and returned for 
more borrowing of £100 just over a week later. She then repaid loan three  on 6 February but 
came back  for a larger amount of £300  one day later. And she borrowed again three days 
after that on 10 February for £250  and £100  on 12 February. So, in February the amount 
borrowed had increased to £650.
Ms D was repaying loans  early just to come  back for further borrowing. And while  I 
appreciate this would have  save Ms D interest, it can equally be an indication  of someone 
juggling their finances. I would question why someone would repay a loan well before the 
agreed loan term, only just to return for more borrowing  very shortly afterwards. 
I think that when  loan six was applied for Sunny should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. It wasnt  just a case  of Ms D not managing  
her money. And so Sunny  should  have realised  that it shouldnt have provided any further 
loans. 
I say this because  at this point  Sunny  ought to have realised Ms D was not managing to 
repay her loans sustainably. Ms D had taken out six loans  (and which included 33 
drawdowns on the running  credit which I have treated as loan one) within seven months. So 
Sunny ought to have realised it was more  likely  than not Ms D was having to borrow  further 
to cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Ms Ds 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
The amounts being  borrowed were not sustainably decreasing. Sunny ought to have known 
that Ms D was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary shortfall in her income but to meet 
an ongoing need. 
Ref: DRN44616654Ms D wasnt  making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. The last loan in this 
chain of borrowing  was taken out 11 months  after Ms Ds first. Ms D had paid large amounts 
of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
In conclusion, for the first chain of borrowing   but not including the running credit Ive 
already addressed above  I dont  think loans two to 12 should have been given. 
Loans 13 to 36
There was a break in the lending of around 15 months after loan 12 and before loan 13 was 
taken. So, Im satisfied there  is a second  and separate chain of borrowing and it wasnt 
unreasonable for Sunny to assume that Ms D had now resolved whatever circumstances 
had caused her to borrow  for loans one to 12. 
Initially the borrowing  Ms D took didnt suggest she was having further problems managing  
her money. With the exception of the first loan in the chain the amounts being borrowed 
were lower - £50 to £100  but a pattern suggesting  the borrowing was becoming  
unsustainable was starting to emerge. 
Ms D took three loans  in quick succession  in May 2018 and a further two in June and again 
she was repaying  the loans  within days or weeks after taking them  out. So, a pattern was 
developing again which would suggest Ms D was juggling  her finances in order to stay 
afloat. 
I think by loan 20 Sunny should have realised Ms D was struggling with her finances.  At loan 
20 the amount  borrowed  had doubled from the previous loans  with the exception  of the 
first loan in the chain.  So, again this could be a suggestion that the borrowing was 
unsustainable, and Ms D was becoming  persistently reliant.  
When she took loan 20 Ms D had been borrowing from Sunny for ten months. And as I said 
for loan six in chain  one, Ms D had again paid large amounts of interest to, in effect,  service  
a debt to Sunny over an extended  period.
So, for loans six to 12 and then loans  20 to 36 I think that Ms D lost out because Sunny 
continued to provide borrowing because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Ds indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Ms D borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Ms Ds ability to access mainstream credit  and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
Like the adjudicator,  Im also upholding the complaint about the running credit  from 
December 2014,  loans two to 12 and then loans 20 to 36 and Sunny should  put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Ms D any drawdowns on loan one, the running credit facility,  
from December 2014 onwards (drawdown  26), loans two to 12 and 20 to 36.
Ref: DRN44616655A).Sunny  should  add together  the total of the repayments  made  by Ms D towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans,  including payments made to a third party  
where applicable, but not including anything Sunny have already refunded.
B).Sunny  should  calculate 8% simple interest*  on the individual payments made by 
Ms D which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date she originally 
made the payments, to the date the complaint  is settled.
C).Sunny  should  pay Ms D the total of A plus B.
D).Sunny  should  remove any adverse information  Sunny has recorded  on Ms Ds credit 
file in relation  to any drawdowns after December 2014  and loans  two to five. The 
overall pattern  of her borrowing for loans 6 to 12, and loans 20 to 36 means any 
information recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans  
entirely from her credit file. If Sunny  has sold any of the loans Sunny should  ask the 
debt purchaser  to do the same. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Ms D a certificate showing how much tax Sunny has deducted,  if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Ds complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms D to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 May 2020.
