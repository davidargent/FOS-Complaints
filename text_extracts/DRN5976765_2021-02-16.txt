K820x#14Complaint
Miss C complains about the way MoneyGram International Limited  trading  as MoneyGram 
(MoneyGram) has handled and investigated  a payment transfer  she made.
Background
MoneyGram is a money transfer service that offers both a cash transfer service from an 
agent and the ability to open an account online for the purpose of sending  money  abroad   
either in cash or to another  account. And, where money is sent or received in cash there is 
no requirement to set up an account.  
What Miss C says
Miss C says she wished to buy a parrot.  After seeing one advertised,  she exchanged 
WhatsApp messages with the seller,  who invited Miss C to visit to view the parrot and 
discuss the sale. As the seller lived a long way away from Miss C a visit wasnt possible.  The 
seller offered  to arrange delivery of the parrot to Miss Cs home  address through an agency  
at a total cost of £400. The agency  requested a MoneyGram transfer abroad, which Miss C 
arranged online on 7 October 2017.  The funds  were to be collected in cash.  
The agent  then asked for a further £680 to cover the cost of insuring the parrot and said the 
sum would be returned to her on delivery of the parrot. Miss C became  suspicious and 
declined to make any more payments. She asked  the seller  to refund her initial £400 
payment but didnt  hear any more from him. Miss C contacted MoneyGram on the day she 
made payment, but it didnt return her funds. Miss C thinks  MoneyGram should refund her 
the money lost in the scam as she says its meant to be a reliable company offering a safe 
transfer and to conduct checks before making  payments.  
What MoneyGram says
MoneyGram points out it is a money  transfer service which sends money to family and 
friends. It says it cant be held responsible if a customer sends payment to someone who 
turns out to have defrauded them or fails to meet their obligations.
Our investigation so far
The investigator didnt  uphold the complaint. He concluded that MoneyGram acted  
reasonably in not identifying that Miss C could be the victim of a scam.  This was because  
the payment was for a relatively small amount and was made  online.  It was also the first time 
Miss C had used MoneyGram,  so there  was no payment history  to compare the transaction  
with, and MoneyGram provided a warning which should have been enough to deter  Miss C 
from making the payment. Finally, MoneyGram  confirmed it hadnt  received any previous 
reports about the recipient.
Miss C didnt accept the investigators findings and asked  for the complaint to be referred to 
an ombudsman, so its been passed to me. She said:
-She first reported the scam to MoneyGram before the payment was complete.
-No terms and conditions were agreed with MoneyGram, as an account wasnt fully 
set up and she didnt  receive confirmation the account was active.
-MoneyGram didnt complete any checks and should have, particularly as she hadnt 
previously made  payments.
-MoneyGram didnt check the recipient of the funds.
Ref: DRN59767652-No warning was displayed when the payment  was made, and MoneyGram  had no 
measures in place  to protect its customers.   
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In deciding whats fair and reasonable in all the circumstances  of a complaint, Im required to
take into account relevant: law and regulations; regulators rules,  guidance  and standards;
codes of practice; and, where appropriate,  what I consider to have been good  industry
practice at the time.
In broad terms, the starting position at law is that MoneyGram is expected to process 
payments that a customer authorises it to make, in accordance with the Payment
Services Regulations and its terms and conditions. And I have taken that into account when 
deciding whats fair and reasonable in this case.
But there are circumstances, such as if the payment is particularly unusual given a 
customers previous payment history, in which MoneyGram should fairly and reasonably 
take additional steps, or make additional  checks,  before  processing  a payment to help 
protect customers from the possibility of financial  harm.  So Ive carefully  considered 
MoneyGrams terms and conditions and the nature of the payment Miss C made.  
Ive thought about whether the payment Miss C made was particularly unusual or out of 
character. It was the first time Miss C made a payment using MoneyGram, so there is no 
payment history to compare it to. But in any event the amount is relatively small and not 
one Id expect  MoneyGram to identify as potentially fraudulent.
MoneyGram may refuse  to allow a transfer  when it considers it may be linked to a fraudulent  
or illegal activity. But MoneyGram say the recipient in this case has a history of receiving 
funds, but no previous  complaints have  been  made. In the circumstances, MoneyGram had 
no reason to suspect  fraud and acted reasonably in making the payment.
I turn now to the points Miss C raised  in her response to the investigators opinion. Miss C 
said no terms and conditions were  agreed with MoneyGram because an account wasnt  set 
up. As a result, she believes  the account  wasnt checked or authorised by MoneyGram to 
allow it to be functional. Im uncertain what Miss C means or how any check  on her could 
have prevented the scam from taking place.  In any event, MoneyGrams terms and 
conditions say,
1.4 By using, or attempting to use, the MoneyGram Online Service  in any capacity you are 
acknowledging that you (i) accept the terms of this Agreement and (ii) have  read all terms 
relating to the Transfer and all information as described in the online form.
Miss C also said MoneyGram didnt provide any warnings, Ive seen  its online payment  
form, which says,
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Please Read!  MONEY TRANSFER FRAUD WARNING
Answer the questions below to help KEEP  YOUR MONEY SAFE.
Ref: DRN59767653Are you sending money to someone you dont know or whose identity you cant 
verify?
If you answer YES to any of the questions DO NOT SEND the money transfer   someone 
may be trying to steal your money. Fraudsters  can quickly collect  the funds you sent at the 
pick-up location.
Miss C has said she notified MoneyGram  of the fraud before the payment was complete. Ive 
been provided with evidence  which shows the payment was made  at 8.12 US Central  time 
on 7 October 2017 and collected abroad at 9.28 US Central time on the same day. There is 
no record of Miss C contacting MoneyGram  between the time the transaction was sent and 
the time it was received. MoneyGram say Miss C called at 10.18 US Central time on 7 
October 2017, at which point her funds had been collected. Ive asked MoneyGram  to check  
whether it has a record of an earlier call and it has confirmed it hasnt. And the investigator 
provided Miss C with these timings  and suggested  she provide a phone  bill if she called 
MoneyGram before the payment was collected. Miss C hasnt provided this evidence. So Im 
satisfied that by the time Miss C called MoneyGram  to report the fraud, the funds had 
already been collected. 
Miss C said MoneyGram didnt check the recipient  of the funds. The recipient for this type of 
transaction didnt  need an account  and MoneyGram has told us that as part of the checks  it 
carried out when  sending the funds,  it was shown that the recipient had a history  of receiving 
funds but there were  no fraudulent reports about  them, which is why the transaction was 
allowed to go ahead.  
Finally, Miss C said that although MoneyGram told her it had closed its file and spoken to 
her, it hadnt  contacted her. I believe MoneyGram  was referring to the conversation it had 
with Miss C when she reported the fraud.   
Overall, Im sorry  to hear of Miss Cs loss, but cant reasonably hold MoneyGram  responsible 
for it. 
My final decision
I do not uphold  this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 15 March 2021.
