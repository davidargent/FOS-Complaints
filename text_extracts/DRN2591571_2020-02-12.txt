Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Ps complaint.  She thought  that MYJAR shouldnt have 
approved loans 4 to 7. MYJAR disagreed with the adjudicators opinion  so the complaint has 
been passed to me, an ombudsman, to make  a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
MYJAR needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr P 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  
These checks could take into account  a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early  stages  of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might  be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that MYJAR should  fairly and reasonably  have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN25915712the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
And the loan payments being  affordable  on a strict pounds and pence  calculation might be 
an indication  a consumer  could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt 
automatically follow this is the case.  The industry regulator defines sustainable as being 
without undue difficulties  and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments 
on time, while meeting  other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having  to borrow  
to meet  the repayments. And it follows that a lender  should realise,  or it ought  fairly and 
reasonably to realise, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
theyre unlikely to be able to make their repayments  without  borrowing further.
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Ps complaint. Ive decided to uphold Mr Ps complaint 
in part and have explained why below.
MYJAR asked Mr P for information  about  his income  and expenditure and it carried  out 
credit checks. It says it used this information to work out Mr Ps disposable income and 
assessed whether  the loans were affordable for him.
For loans 1-3, given  the amounts lent, what was apparent  about  Mr Ps circumstances at the 
time and his relatively short  borrowing  history  with MYJAR, I dont think it wouldve been 
proportionate to ask him for the amount of information needed  to show the lending  was 
unsustainable. There wasnt  anything in the information Mr P provided or the information 
MYJAR shouldve been  aware of (including the credit search results), which meant it 
wouldve been proportionate to start verifying  what Mr P was saying.
But by loan 4, I think its reasonable  to say that Mr P was, more  likely than not, having  longer 
term problems repaying his loans. And MYJAR  shouldve been aware of this. He had taken 
out three short term loans in quick  succession with small  breaks in between. So a pattern of 
dependency was already  emerging in respect of his lending. 
Mr P took out loan 4 on 10th April 2016  and at this stage MYJAR had seen him making 
repayments to it for around 5 months. The amounts he was paying was for a similar amount 
and I think it would have  become apparent  at this stage that he would have  been  struggling 
to repay  the amount owed.  So I dont  think it was reasonable for MYJAR to have assumed 
that Mr P would be in a position to make  further  repayments without it causing him problems. 
So I dont  think it shouldve approved loan 4 or any loan after this point. So Im upholding Mr 
Ps complaint about loans 4-7. 
And Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of MYJARs lending  history with Mr P, with a view 
to seeing if there was a point at which MYJAR should reasonably have seen that further 
lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so MYJAR should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mr Ps case, I think  that this point  was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
Ref: DRN25915713By loan 6, the amounts  Mr P was borrowing had not decreased, and going forward  
Mr P was provided  with a new loan within a very short time of settling a previous one. 
MYJAR ought to have  realised it was more likely than not Mr P was having  to borrow 
further to cover  the hole repaying  his previous  loan was leaving in his finances and 
that Mr Ps indebtedness had become  unsustainable.
Mr P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed MYJAR. Loan 6 was 
taken out around 9 months after Mr Ps first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mr P had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect; service  a debt to MYJAR over an 
extended period.
I think that Mr P lost out because MYJAR  continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards because:
These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing  
him to take expensive  credit over an extended  period of time.
The sheer number  of loans was likely to have  had negative implications on Mr Ps 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint and MYJAR should  now put things right.
putting things right  what MYJAR needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Mr P paid on loans 4 to 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5 from Mr Ps credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from 6 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 and 7 should be removed  from Mr Ps 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires MYJAR to take off tax from this interest. MYJAR must 
give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I partly uphold  Mr Ps complaint. MYJAR Limited  should  put 
things right by doing what  Ive said above.  Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman  
Service, I am required to ask Mr P to accept or reject my decision before 12 March  2020.
