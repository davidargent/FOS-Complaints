K820x#14complaint
Mr S complains Tesco Personal Finance PLC misled him about  the period  of time of a 
promotional interest  rate.
background
Mr S had two credit  cards with Tesco numbered 0850 and 5515. It sent him a letter  with a 
money transfer offer with a promotional rate which would last to the end of June 2020 and a 
fee of 2.99%. He thought  this offer was on both his credit  cards.  But after hed made a 
transfer on his card 0850 he found that the introductory rate on this card expired  in February 
2019. The longer promotional rate was on his other  card (5515). 
When he realised he had to repay  the balance on 0850 he transferred the funds  online  on 28 
February 2019. But he says Tesco froze his money  and didnt acknowledge it as having 
been received  until 4 March. And it charged  him £23.99 interest. He thinks  Tesco  shouldve  
made it clear  that the offers on the two credit cards were different. So he wants Tesco to 
refund the transfer fee (£116.87) and the interest (£23.99).
Tesco said the letter about the promotional offer clearly stated it applied to his card 5515. 
And it said it didnt freeze his money when he made payment on his account 0850. Payment 
was due to be received  no later than 2 March  2019. It said Mr S logged  into its online service  
on Friday 1 March.  The funds cleared the next working day which  was Monday 4 March.  It 
said that when  a payment is made  online before 6pm it will reach  the customers  account  the 
next working day. If its made after 6pm they should allow  two working  days. But it told us 
that it charged Mr S interest not for when it received  the payment but because he no longer 
had a promotional  interest rate.
The adjudicator didnt think Tesco had done  anything wrong.  He thought  Tesco had done 
enough to make Mr S aware that the promotional offer in the letter  only applied to his card 
5155 because  it stated that at the head  of the letter.  And he thought Tesco had done enough 
to make Mr S aware that the introductory rate on 0850 was due to end on 5 February  2019.  
He could see that Mr S logged into his account on 1 March 2019 and that Tesco had acted 
in line with the terms of the account  in that the transfer of money wouldnt have reached his 
account until the next working day which was 4 March 2019.
Mr S didnt agree. He said at the time he decided to take up the promotional  money  transfer 
offer he hadnt received any information to say that the introductory  rate would expire his 
card 0850  on 5 February 2019. He said the only information hed received suggested a 
much longer  interest free period to June 2020.  And he said he couldnt  understand the 
reference to clearing  when  electronic  systems make transfers instantaneous and Tesco 
holds the information about account  balances on the same computer system.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know Mr S wont agree  but I dont think Tesco has done anything  wrong.
Ref: DRN21233702Mr S applied for the account 0850  in November 2018. The introductory rate was detailed on 
his December 2018 statement. On 15 January 2019 it sent him a letter which  said the 
introductory rate was coming to an end on 5 February 2019.  All the correspondence  said this 
information applied  to 0850.  But Mr S said he took advantage of the money  transfer offer on 
30 November 2018 before he received any of this information.
In November 2018 Tesco sent Mr S a letter which was about  his account 5515.  The account 
number is at the top of the letter. The letter said that the promotional  rate of interest  was due 
to expire in June  2020. Mr S says he acted  on this letter in relation to his account 0850. But I 
dont think Tesco can be blamed for that when this letter has the account number 5515 at 
the top. So I think Tesco did enough  to make it clear to Mr S which  card account  the 
promotional rate expiring  in June 2020  applied to.
And I think Tesco did enough to make  it clear that customers  should  allow  for a delay in 
payments reaching  an account where payment is made online. Mr S says this shouldnt  
make a difference with instantaneous electronic transfers. But Tesco has set its own 
timescales for paying money into an account. It gives  this information on all its monthly 
statements. So I dont find it did anything wrong  when  Mr Ss payment on 1 March  2019 
didnt reach  the relevant account  until 4 March 2019.
Tesco says it charged interest not because of the late payment but because  the introductory 
rate had expired. As Im satisfied it notified  Mr S of this I cant fairly say it did anything wrong 
when it charged him interest in line with its terms and conditions.
my final decision
My decision  is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 19 March  2020.
