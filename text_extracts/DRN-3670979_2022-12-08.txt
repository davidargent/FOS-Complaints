The complaint
Mr D complains that Revolut Ltd blocked access to his account, and returned his funds to 
source. Hed like the money refunded and compensation for the impact. 
What happened
Mr D had an account with Revolut. 
On 6 and 7 July 2020 Mr D received two payments of 100,000 dollars and just over 86,400 
euros into his Revolut account. 
On the same day, Revolut blocked Mr Ds access to his account. And on 7 July 2020 they 
asked Mr D for proof of ownership for the funds. 
Mr D explained that the money was repayment for a loan hed given his brother ten years 
earlier. 
Revolut werent satisfied with the evidence Mr D provided and on 20 August 2020 closed his 
account. They made a decision to return all of Mr Ds funds to source, which was carried out 
on 13 October 2020. 
Mr D complained to Revolut that theyd repeatedly asked him to supply the same 
documents, and he couldnt find just over 17,200 euros which the bank said theyd returned 
to him. And he didnt find the money until the 27 November 2020. 
One of our investigators looked into Mr Ds complaint, and they thought Revolut should have 
done more. 
In summary they thought Revolut acted fairly in blocking the funds and returning them to 
source but they should have done some things better:
They thought Revolut hadnt acted fairly in asking Mr D to open a euro account, and 
should have returned his 17,246.21 euros sooner and on 20 August 2020
Mr D was caused distress by Revoluts misinformation on the 86,489 euros
Revoluts communication with Mr D was very poor throughout their handling of his 
case. They regularly didnt respond for hours, weeks or days and this caused him 
significant distress. 
Our investigator thought that Revolut should pay Mr D 8% interest on 17,246 euros from 
20 August 2020 to 27 November 2020. And compensate him £400 for the inconvenience 
caused. 
Mr D didnt accept our investigators opinion, in response he said:
The 100,000 dollars wasnt returned immediately and he should be paid interest up to 
the date he was informed it was returned
He wasnt given any information by Revolut
The 13.25 euros wasnt returned to him and he doesnt think he keep searching for it
Our investigator reviewed Mr Ds response, but didnt change their opinion. They thought 
£400 compensation was fair for the inconvenience caused to him, and were satisfied that the 
13.25 euros had been returned to his account.
Mr D didnt accept our investigators conclusions so its been passed to me for a decision. 
I reviewed Mr Ds complaint but came to a slightly different conclusion to our investigator. I 
thought theyd acted fairly in returning most of his funds to source  but I didnt think Revolut 
had sufficient concerns, or asked enough questions to see if Mr D could provide suitable 
proof of entitlement for the funds present in his account prior to closure. And therefore I 
didnt think Revolut acted fairly in returning all of his funds to source. I thought Revolut 
should:
Pay Mr D 8% on 17,246.21 euros from 20 August 2020 to 27 November 2020
Pay Mr D £400 in compensation for the inconvenience caused
Pay Mr D 13.25 euros plus 8% from 20 August 2020 to the date this is returned
I wrote to Revolut to explain my thoughts  and they accepted my recommendations.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive considered Revoluts actions on restricting Mr Ds account. Ive looked at the terms and 
conditions of his account and the wider regulatory obligations Revolut need to comply with. 
Revoluts terms are clear in detailing their ability to review accounts and suspend them when 
necessary  and I think they initially followed these terms and conditions fairly. It follows, I 
cant say they acted unfairly in blocking access to Mr Ds account. However, I do need to 
think about whether the review was completed as quickly as Id expect.
Mr Ds account was restricted on 7 July 2020 and they made the decision to close his 
account on 20 August 2020 and return his funds to source. Ive considered the length of time 
they took to carry out the review and I think this was completed in a timely manner. Ive also 
thought about the outcome of the review  and Im satisfied Revoluts conclusions, that the 
evidence supplied by Mr D wasnt sufficient to show entitlement to the funds, were fair. 
Therefore I cant say they acted unfairly in returning 100,000 dollars and 86,489 euros to 
source. 
However these arent the only funds Revolut sent to source  they also sent just over 
17,000 euros to one of Mr Ds former accounts. Revolut have accepted my thoughts on this 
 however, Ill briefly explain my thinking in asking them to refund 13.25 euros and pay 
interest on both payments. Ive considered whether Revolut asked Mr D for any proof of 
entitlement for the 17,246.21 euros. And I dont think they asked sufficient questions to 
determine if Mr D was entitled to the funds. it follows Im not satisfied Revolut were entitled 
to send these funds to source, and they should have been released to Mr D on 20 August 
2020 once the review was complete. Mr Ds argued that because he wasnt informed the 100,000 dollars had been returned to 
source he should be paid interest in the same form as the 17,246.21 euros. Im afraid I cant 
agree with him here  as Ive already outlined I think Revolut acted fairly in returning the 
funds to source. As the evidence wasnt sufficient to show Mr D was entitled to the funds. 
Because Mr D didnt evidence sufficient entitlement at the time of the review, I cant say hes 
been inconvenience by Revoluts actions in regard to the 100,000 dollars. And therefore I 
wont be awarding any additional interest payment. 
Ive also considered all the other payments returned to source including the 13.25 euros. 
Mr Ds advised hes managed to obtain all of the payments returned apart from 13.25 euros. 
For the reasons Ive outlined above Revolut shouldnt have returned all of Mr Ds funds to 
source, including the 13.25 euros. Revolut have accepted they sent these funds to a closed 
account in Mr Ds name  and Mr Ds since been unable to obtain them. Which I find 
plausible. As Mr D remains without these funds, I think Revolut should also return these 
funds to him. 
Mr D has been caused inconvenience by Revoluts actions. As outlined by our investigator 
they failed to respond to Mr Ds requests for updates and didnt communicate as quickly as 
Id expect between 7 July 2020 and when his account was closed on 20 August 2020. I also 
think Mr D was caused inconvenience by Revoluts decision to return all of his funds to 
source. 
Putting things right
Ive considered our guidelines for distress and inconvenience awards, thought about the 
length of time Mr D was without his funds and the impact on him from the poor 
communication he received from Revolut. And having done so I think £400 is fair 
compensation. 
My final decision
My final decision is I uphold Mr Ds complaint and direct Revolut Ltd to:
Pay 8% interest on 17,246.21 euros from 20 August 2020 to 27 November 2020
Pay Mr D 13.25 euros plus 8% interest from 20 August 2020 to the date this is 
returned
Pay Mr D £400 in compensation for the inconvenience caused
Any tax lawfully due on the interest may be deducted if needs be, with the bank providing a  
tax deduction certificate to Mr D so he can claim it back from HMRC if appropriate. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 January 2023.
