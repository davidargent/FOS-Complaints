The complaint
Mr B complains that Vanquis Bank Limited (Vanquis) defaulted his account.
What happened
Mr B had a credit card with Vanquis. He was struggling to pay his debts. In January 2018, 
Vanquis agreed a payment plan of £50 per month at zero interest. In February 2019, March 
2019 and April 2019, Mr B missed the payments. In May 2019 and thereafter he paid £25 
per month. In March 2019, Vanquis sent Mr B a Notice of Default with the balance £2088.68. 
In April 2019, the debt was passed to a debt collection agency (DCA) to collect the 
payments. A default was registered in November 2019. In October 2020, Mr B paid off the 
debt with a payment of £1238.68.
Mr B complained that the entries on his credit file were wrong. Hed called Vanquis in March 
2019 (when one payment had been missed) and offered to pay £25 a month. They declined 
to accept this until hed sent to them an income and expenditure form  which they would 
mail to him. But until then, the account was to be placed on hold. So  Mr B said that the 
subsequent Notice of Default and the registration of default was unfair. He also wasnt 
advised the debt would be passed to a DCA. He was now finding it difficult to get credit. He 
wants the defaults removed and compensation paid.
Vanquis said theyd acted correctly. The £50 a month payments were made successfully 
until February 2019 to April 2019, when payments stopped. After that, £25 a month was paid 
 but because these werent for the agreed amount, Mr B had broken the agreement. So, a 
Notice of Default was sent in March 2019 and his account passed to a DCA. In November 
2019, a default was registered on Mr Bs credit file.
Mr B brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said Vanquis had acted fairly. Hed 
missed the payments in February 2019 to April 2019. Statements sent at that time showed 
the arrears due and included a warning that legal action might take place. The letters and 
statements sent to Mr B made it clear what would happen if payments werent brought up to 
date. And so  the default registered by Vanquis in November 2019 was correctly applied.
Mr B didnt agree and asked that his complaint be looked at by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The crux of Mr Bs complaint is that in March 2019, he called Vanquis and offered to pay £25 
per month. Vanquis said they couldnt agree that without seeing an income and expenditure 
form  which they would send him - and they said to him that his account would be put on 
hold until it was received back. Mr B says he didnt receive the form, and so he then paid 
£25 a month. So  Mr B complains that all of Vanquis actions after that were wrong and 
unfair.
Vanquis sent to us the call that Mr B made to them on 11 March 2019. Ive listened to this. 
Its content isnt what Mr B says. In it, Mr B says hed missed the payment of £50 in February 
2019  hed had expenses of a house move and a car accident. He said he could pay the 
March 2019 regular instalment. Vanquis offered to pay the missed February 2019 payment 
of £50 if Mr B paid the £50 in March 2019. Mr B agreed to this and said it would be paid on 
15 March 2019. Vanquis said the agreement for them to pay their £50 would only happen if 
Mr B paid his £50. There was no mention by either Vanquis or Mr B of a payment plan or 
offer of £25 a month, or of an income and expenditure form. So  as far as Vanquis were 
concerned, quite reasonably, the original agreement of £50 a month was still in place. There 
wasnt any agreement or discussion about a reduced payment of £25.
Ive looked at Mr Bs payments  and the £50 wasnt paid in March 2019. So  the £50 
payment offered by Vanquis also didnt take place. And, Mr B didnt make a payment in April 
2019 either  so hed then missed three payments.
Mr B complains that he wasnt aware that his account would be passed to a DCA, and that 
the default shouldnt have been registered. Ive also considered this.
The Notice of Default dated 12 March 2019 says, If you fail to make a sufficient payment or 
set up an arrangement we may file a default in respect to your credit card with the credit 
reference agencies. In the monthly statements sent to Mr B between February 2019 and 
November 2019, they state that his account was in arrears and that failure to bring them up 
to date could lead to legal action  they stated Failing to make your minimum 
payment.could result in us taking legal action against youand make it more difficult for 
you to obtain credit in future. So - I consider that Mr B was advised that a default might be 
registered. 
The statements in April 2019 and May 2019 also said Your details have been passed to (a 
DCA) to recover the outstanding debtplease contact them directly So  I think that Mr B 
was advised that a DCA was appointed.
Looking at the default that was registered in November 2019.  The guidance for dealing with 
defaults is laid down by the Information Commissioners Office (ICO). This says when a 
consumer is at least three months behind with their payments then a default may be 
registered. And it would expect a default to be registered by the time the consumer is six 
months behind with their payments. It is the business responsibility to put an entry on the 
credit file. This cannot be taken off unless it is an error. Because Mr B was only paying £25 a 
month (rather than the agreed £50 a month) I can see that by the October 2019 statement, 
Mr B was £200 in arrears, and by November 2019 the arrears were £225. So, on that basis, I 
cant say that Vanquis were wrong to register the default.
Mr B has also said to us that its unfair that the default is still showing on his credit file  even 
though the debt has been repaid. This wasnt part of Mr Bs original complaint. But - I can 
see that the original agreement with Vanquis in January 2018 said that once repaid it would 
be shown as settled. And thats what should now be shown on his credit file. I havent seen 
an up to date credit file for Mr B, so I cant say what is now shown. But if Mr B wishes to take 
this up with Vanquis, he should do so.
And so  and I accept this will be disappointing for Mr B  I dont think Vanquis have acted 
unfairly or unreasonably, and I wont be asking them to do anymore here.
My final decisionI do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 August 2021.
