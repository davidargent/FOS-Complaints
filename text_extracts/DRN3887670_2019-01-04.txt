K820x#14complaint
Mr C complains that National  Westminster  Bank  Plc blocked and closed his bank accounts 
and hasnt satisfactorily explained  why it did so. He says this caused problems for him 
because he wasnt able to access his funds and he wants NatWest  to compensate him.
background
On 1 November  2018, NatWest blocked  Mr Cs accounts. The block stopped Mr C from 
being able to access money in his accounts. NatWest unblocked Mr Cs accounts on 13 
November 2018.  On 14 November 2018, NatWest wrote to Mr C to let him know  it had 
decided to close his accounts. And it gave him 60 days notice to make alternative  banking 
arrangements. 
Mr C says that NatWest hasnt properly explained  the reasons why it blocked and then 
closed his accounts. Hes told us that this caused him a great deal of stress  and anxiety. And 
the blocks on his accounts made it difficult for him to pay his bills and mortgage.
Mr C complained to NatWest. It said its not obliged to enter into any discussion with Mr C to 
explain its decision to block and then close  his accounts. It says it acted in accordance with 
the terms and conditions of Mr Cs accounts.  Unhappy with this response  Mr C brought  his 
complaint to this service.
Our investigator explained NatWest werent  required to provide their reasons for the block 
and closure of the accounts. She was satisfied NatWest had acted fairly and in line with the 
terms and conditions of the accounts.  And that it had followed its legal and regulatory 
obligations. So she didnt  uphold the complaint.
Mr C disagreed. Hes still upset that NatWest blocked his accounts without explanation. He 
says this caused him a great  deal of upset and inconvenience. He says he hasnt done 
anything wrong  and has been a NatWest customer for a number  of years.  He wants 
NatWest to provide  a full explanation and pay him compensation  for the trouble NatWest  
caused by blocking  his accounts.  So the complaint has come  to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can understand why Mr C is upset. Im sorry this experience has been stressful  for him But 
for me to uphold  his complaint I have to think NatWest has done something  wrong.  And in 
this case, I dont think it has. Ill explain  why.
account block
I appreciate Mr C feels strongly about  his complaint. But NatWest was entitled  to review his 
accounts under the account  terms and conditions. Having  looked at the evidence, Im 
satisfied that NatWest acted in line with its legal and regulatory obligations when it blocked 
and reviewed Mr Cs accounts.  I accept that that this caused  Mr C difficulty. And I can 
understand that hes frustrated that he hasnt  been  given a proper explanation. But NatWest  
doesnt have to provide this information. So I cant say NatWest did anything wrong by not 
giving him this information.
Ref: DRN38876702Having looked  at whats happened  in this particular case, I can see no basis on which 
I might  make  an award  against NatWest given that I dont think it failed to properly follow  its 
own procedures when  it blocked and reviewed Mr Cs accounts.  So Im not going to ask 
NatWest to compensate  him for any distress and inconvenience this may have caused him.
account closure
A bank  is entitled  to close an account with a customer just as a customer may close  an 
account with a bank. But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which 
complies with the terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions  of the account  which both NatWest and Mr C had to comply with 
 say that it could  close  the accounts by giving him 60 days notice. NatWest  has done this. 
So its entitled to close the accounts  as it seems its already  done.  
Mr C wants NatWest to reopen his accounts.  But the bank can make  commercial decisions 
about who it offers banking services to. They cannot unfairly discriminate against a 
customer. But they can say they no longer wish to do business  with individuals.  Thats 
because theyve got the commercial freedom to decide who they want to contract  with. And 
Im satisfied that NatWest  has exercised its commercial decision legitimately when it decided 
to close Mr Cs accounts. So I cannot  fairly  and reasonably say its done anything wrong.
In summary,  I know my decision will come as a great  frustration and disappointment to 
Mr C. And I note the comments hes made to the investigator about how this has all affected 
him. So I should make it clear that this is an informal dispute resolution service.  We dont  
have the same powers as a court  for instance to take evidence on oath. And, while we 
take relevant law, regulation and good practice  into account, we consider what is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances. And having looked at whats happened here I dont think 
NatWest treated Mr C unfairly when  it blocked and closed his accounts.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 February  2019.
