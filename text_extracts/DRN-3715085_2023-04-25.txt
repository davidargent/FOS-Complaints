The complaint
Mr and Mrs V complain that Shawbrook Bank Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid for some holiday club membership points. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs V had bought holiday club membership points from a holiday company four 
times between January 2010 and April 2015 and they entered into a purchase agreement in 
April 2016 to buy some more holiday club membership points. The total price of the 
additional points was £10,719 and they entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with 
Shawbrook Bank for a loan of that amount. They agreed to make 120 monthly repayments of 
£158.20 to Shawbrook Bank.
Mr and Mrs Vs representative made claims to Shawbrook Bank in June 2018 under sections 
75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and about a breach of fiduciary duty. It said 
that the membership had been misrepresented to Mr and Mrs V, the holiday company had 
breached the contract, Shawbrook Bank had paid a commission to the holiday company but 
didnt obtain Mr and Mrs Vs informed consent, and there was an unfair relationship between 
Mr and Mrs V and Shawbrook Bank.
A substantive response to those claims hadnt been received so Mr and Mrs V complained to 
this service. Shawbrook Bank then issued a detailed response to their claims in which it set 
out the reasons that it had concluded that their complaint shouldnt be upheld.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Vs complaint should be upheld. He 
wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale or that the holiday 
company had breached the contract. He said that he hadnt seen enough to suggest that the 
relationship between Mr and Mrs V and Shawbrook Bank was unfair and he wasnt 
persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. He didnt 
consider that Shawbrook Bank had acted incorrectly in connection with any commission paid 
to the holiday company.
Mr and Mrs Vs representative, on their behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered 
by an ombudsman. It says that our investigators recommendation is manifestly wrong and 
none of the relevant clauses have been reviewed. It says that there have been breaches of 
the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010, the 
Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 and the Consumer Protection from 
Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 and it has provided a list of terms which it says may be 
regarded as unfair. It has provided a document supporting its complaints about the holiday 
company in which it describes the reasons that it considers that theres been a fundamental 
breach of its contracts by the holiday company. It also says, amongst other things, that the 
holiday company didnt broker proper credit and the provision of finance was unfair and 
failed to reach the standard expected of a firm regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. 
It has described its serious concerns about the way that the finance was sold to Mr and 
Mrs V and it has also provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday 
company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Vs complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Vs claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Shawbrook Banks response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Mr and Mrs V had purchased some holiday club membership points from the holiday 
company in January 2010, they traded in those points and paid to upgrade their 
membership in February 2011, they traded in those points and paid to again upgrade 
their membership in September 2013 and they bought more membership points in 
April 2015;
Mr and Mrs V then purchased more holiday club membership points in April 2016 
and they signed documents including a purchase agreement, the terms and 
conditions, a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be given, a 
key information document, the holiday companys compliance statement, a loan 
application form, the loan agreement and Shawbrook Banks compliance statement;
Mr and Mrs V have provided a statement describing how they says the points were 
mis-sold to them by the holiday company in April 2016 and their representative 
described in the claim letter that it sent to Shawbrook Bank in June 2018 the 
following misrepresentations that it says were made by the holiday company;
Mr and Mrs V were advised that by purchasing the points they would receive 
a guaranteed yearly rental income;
they believed that they were buying into an exclusive membership;
they were advised that they would receive priority when booking; and
they were advised that they would receive the best possible rates when 
making bookings; 
the holiday companys compliance statement which was signed by Mr and Mrs V 
says: We understand that [the holiday company] operates a Rental Programme and 
that to participate, we must ask the Travel Club to convert our points into a week 
which will then be placed in the Programme. Whilst there is no guarantee that the 
week will be rented out, if it is, we can currently expect to be paid upto £100  per 
1000 Points (less 15% commission plus vat);
if that wasnt what Mr and Mrs V were expecting, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect them to have raised that issue with the holiday company before 
signing the documents but Im not persuaded that its likely that they would have 
been told that they would receive a guaranteed rental income  and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs V asked the travel club to convert any of their 
points into weeks for rental;
the compliance statement also says: We understand that the purchase of our Points 
is an investment in our future holidays, but that it should not be regarded as a 
property or financial investment ;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
told Mr and Mrs V that the membership was exclusive or that they would receive the 
best possible rates when making bookings and if those issues were important to 
them I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have ensured that they 
were recorded in the documents that they signed;
I consider that it was reasonable for Mr and Mrs V to expect some priority when 
making bookings but that doesnt mean that availability would be guaranteed and Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
misrepresented to them the priority that they would receive for their bookings;
Mr and Mrs Vs representative has also referred to breaches of contract by the 
holiday company and it says that the holiday company is in breach of contract by 
including manifestly unfair terms in the documents and that Mr and Mrs V didnt 
receive notices of the holiday companys general meetings;
I dont consider that the inclusion of an unfair term would be a breach of contract for 
which Shawbrook Bank would be liable under section 75 in these circumstances;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of contract in connection with the general meeting notices  if Mr and Mrs V hadnt 
received the notices that they were expecting I consider that it would be reasonable 
to expect them to have contacted the holiday company but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that they did so;
Mr and Mrs Vs representative has referred to the 2012 general meeting having 
already taken place  but I consider that Shawbrook Bank would only be liable for 
any breach of contract relating to the additional points that Mr and Mrs V bought in 
April 2016 so I dont consider that it would have any liability under section 75 arising 
from any failure by the holiday company to give Mr and Mrs V notice of the 2012 
general meeting;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the membership points 
were misrepresented to Mr and Mrs V, that the holiday company has breached the 
terms of their agreement with it or that theres been a breach of any applicable law or 
regulation for which Shawbrook Bank would be liable in these circumstances;
Mr and Mrs Vs representatives letter to Shawbrook Bank in June 2018 said that 
there been a breach of fiduciary duty because of the commission that Shawbrook 
Bank had paid to the holiday company and it set out the basis on which it considered 
that Mr and Mrs Vs relationship with Shawbrook Bank was unfair including: the 
commission that it had paid to the holiday company without obtaining Mr and Mrs Vs 
informed consent; the sales practices that it had used; Mr and Mrs V had limited 
means and could only afford the membership with the aid of the finance; no choice 
as to the finance provider was presented to Mr and Mrs V; and breaches of 
applicable codes and regulations;
the holiday companys compliance statement which was signed by Mr and Mrs V 
says: We are aware that [the holiday company] is able to recommend credit facilities 
to its customers to fund their purchase, but understand that [it] is not independent. 
We have been advised that [it] works with a number of selected credit providers and 
 is entitled to receive a commission in respect of credit brokered;Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid 
by Shawbrook Bank to the holiday company but, from what this service has seen 
across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less than 
15% and Im satisfied that Shawbrook Bank wouldnt have breached any duty in 
making any such payment  nor was it under any regulatory duty to disclose the 
amount of any commission paid in these circumstances - and I dont consider that the 
level of any commission that was normally paid in this type of situation was 
sufficiently high to mean that Shawbrook Bank should have appreciated that not 
disclosing any commission to Mr and Mrs V risked the relationship being unfair under 
section 140A  and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
theres been a breach of fiduciary duty by Shawbrook Bank;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs V were 
unduly pressurised into buying the membership points or entering into the loan 
agreement in April 2016 or that the holiday company used unacceptable sales 
practices against them;
Mr and Mrs V signed the holiday companys compliance statement which said: We 
confirm that we have been treated courteously during the sales presentation, that we 
have been given plenty of time to consider if the product is right for us and we have 
not been put under any pressure to purchase our Points;
they also signed the separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be 
given so they would have been aware that they had  the right to withdraw from this 
contract within 14 days without giving any reason  if they were concerned about the 
sales practices that had been used by the holiday company and didnt want to 
purchase the points, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have 
contacted the holiday company or Shawbrook Bank about withdrawing from the 
agreement within the withdrawal period but Ive seen no evidence to show that they 
did so;
Mr and Mrs V signed a loan application form in which they confirmed that they were 
employed home-owners with no mortgage and that they had a joint annual income of 
£42,000 and I consider that it would have been fair and reasonable for Shawbrook 
Bank to have concluded that they could afford a loan with monthly repayments of 
£158.20 at that time;
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for 
Mr and Mrs V in April 2016 when it was made to them or that theyve experienced 
any financial difficulties since then;
Mr and Mrs V also signed Shawbrook Banks compliance statement in which they 
confirmed that they received the pre-contract credit information, an adequate 
explanation document and the withdrawal form and, immediately above their 
signatures the statement said: We agree that we have access to more than one 
lender to assist with the purchase of this Holiday Ownership Product however we 
believe that the credit agreement offered meets our requirements;
the holiday company was identified as the credit intermediary on the loan agreement 
and it was authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority to arrange loans in April 
2016 - Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that it was unfair or 
unreasonable for Shawbrook Bank to have lent to Mr and Mrs V, that it has acted 
incorrectly in connection with the loan agreement or that it has failed to reach the 
standards expected of it by the Financial Conduct Authority;
the terms and conditions that Mr and Mrs V signed say: You agree to pay annual 
Management Charges, which are described at Article 13 of the Articles of Association 
 and in the Management Agreement   The charges will be calculated for future years as described in these documents; and there was further information about the 
management charges in the key information document and the holiday companys 
compliance statement;
I consider that the management charges could have been more clearly explained to 
Mr and Mrs V but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
management charges were unfair;
Ive carefully considered what Mr and Mrs Vs representative has said about the 
unfairness of the terms of the agreement that Mr and Mrs V entered into with the 
holiday company in April 2016 and the breaches of applicable regulations and codes 
that it has described but it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the 
terms in those agreements were unfair;
I dont consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is 
likely to mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship 
between a debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated 
in practice and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be 
unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr and Mrs V and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs V and 
Shawbrook Bank;
Mr and Mrs Vs representative has provided a generic submission from counsel 
about the holiday company but Im not persuaded that it shows that Mr and Mrs Vs 
relationship with Shawbrook Bank was unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Vs 
relationship with Shawbrook Bank was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs V 
and Shawbrook Bank in these circumstances;
I consider that it was fair and reasonable for Shawbrook Bank not to have upheld Mr 
and Mrs Vs claims and, although there was a delay in its response to their claims, I 
consider that the response that it provided to them was fair and reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs V for the issues that theyve have had with their 
membership, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require 
Shawbrook Bank to arrange for them to be released from the purchase agreement, to 
release them from the loan agreement, to refund to them any of the money that 
theyve paid under the loan agreement, to pay them any compensation or to take any 
other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Vs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs V to 
accept or reject my decision before 23 May 2023.
