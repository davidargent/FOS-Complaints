K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains about the content  of a letter he received  from National Westminster  Bank 
Plc, which requested  personal information. He is also unhappy  with the service he received  
after he contacted  National  Westminster Bank  to query the authenticity  of this letter.
background
Mr M received a letter from NatWest which asked  him to confirm his Tax Identification  
Number and date of birth. He was requested to return this information to NatWest  in the 
envelope that was enclosed with the letter.
Mr M was unhappy with the content of this correspondence, which he said was requesting 
information he had previously provided NatWest.  This letter was neither dated  nor signed. 
And he stated that the letter quoted an originating  address that didnt correlate  with the 
geographical location of the phone number. Mr M said the return  envelope made no 
reference to NatWest. The logo on the letter was monochrome and not in the usual  NatWest  
colour. He thought this letter was a photocopy. And this all led Mr M to believe that the letter 
he had received wasnt genuine. He thought  it was a scam to attempt to obtain  his personal 
information.
On 18 December 2018, Mr M contacted NatWest to check  the authenticity of this letter. He 
said he was transferred to the fraud  department but his call was then cut off. He said when 
he called  back he was placed on hold and, on reaching the fraud department,  Mr M said he 
was asked to answer security questions,  which he felt were inappropriate. After  completing 
security Mr M said he was advised  the letter he had received was genuine.  
Mr M decided to raise a complaint with NatWest.  He said he thought the security  questions 
he was asked were inappropriate.  And he felt the automated message he heard during that 
call regarding call volumes being  higher  than normal was misleading and untrue. Mr M also 
said his complaint wasnt properly recorded  and he didnt receive a call to discuss escalating  
his concerns after his call on 18 December 2018.
When NatWest responded to Mr Ms complaint it reiterated that the letter he had received  
was genuine.  And it stated that the automated  message he heard was intended to advise 
customers they may be subject to a lengthy wait to enable them call back  at another  time if 
they preferred.  NatWest  didnt agree that the questions Mr M was asked to verify his 
identification werent appropriate.  It did accept,  though, that it shouldve recorded  a 
complaint on 18 December 2018  when  Mr M contacted NatWest.  And, it credited Mr Ms 
account with £50 as an apology for what had happened. 
Being dissatisfied with NatWests response  Mr M brought his complaint to us. Our 
adjudicator looked into this and, while they empathised with Mr M, didnt think that NatWest  
needed to do anything more here. They thought  that the £50 compensation that Mr M had 
already been paid was appropriate  and fair. And they felt NatWest  had dealt  with Mr Ms 
complaint fairly. But Mr M disagreed and asked for the matter to be referred  to an 
ombudsman.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  While I sympathise with Mr M, having 
Ref: DRN00681212considered everything  he and NatWest have said, I agree with our adjudicator  for broadly 
the same  reasons. I understand Mr M will be disappointed so Ill explain why I dont uphold 
this complaint.
NatWest has explained  that it sent Mr M the correspondence, which  is the subject of this 
complaint, because the law requires it to identify customers tax statuses. It said to comply 
with this obligation it may ask its customers to complete a tax status  declaration form. I 
appreciate that Mr M says NatWest already had the information it was requesting.  But, as its 
a legal requirement for NatWest to ensure it has correct information  about its customers, I 
cant fairly conclude  it did anything wrong in sending the letter it sent Mr M.
Having seen this correspondence though, I can understand why Mr M had reason to 
question its authenticity. And I can appreciate  how concerning it mustve been  for Mr M to 
receive a letter requesting  personal  information,  which he believed to be fraudulent. I can 
see NatWest assured him when he contacted it that the letter  was genuine.  I think  this 
assurance was given promptly. 
Based on the evidence  Ive seen, Im satisfied  NatWest has understood why the 
correspondence it sent Mr M caused  doubts as to its authenticity.  Its apologised for the 
letter being  unsigned and undated.  And I think the explanation it gave him as to why the 
address and telephone  number did not correlate  geographically is reasonable. Im 
persuaded that NatWest has recognised the concerns Mr M had here in its response  to his 
complaint.
Mr M believes our service  should  tell NatWest  not to send letters like the one he received as 
they could led a customer to have similar  concerns regarding  their veracity. But Id like to 
make it clear  to Mr M that our service cant tell a bank how information should be presented  
to a customer in correspondence because thats a matter for the regulator, the Financial 
Conduct Authority  (FCA).  So Mr Ms comments about the content  of the letter  he was sent 
fall outside the remit of this service. And this means I cant  tell NatWest to make the changes 
he would  like. I can see our adjudicator has already  provided Mr M with details of the FCA 
should he wish to contact  it to pursue this matter further.
Ill turn now to the concerns Mr M has about  the service  he feels  he received after contacting  
NatWest to query this letter. When Mr M contacted NatWest I understand that he was 
transferred to the fraud  department. While on hold during that call he said the automated  
messages he heard  about call waiting times were misleading and unsuitable.
I can appreciate why Mr M may be unhappy  that he had to wait while trying to reach the 
fraud department. But this isnt something NatWest  is able to influence  as it cant control  or 
predict call volumes. It uses a generic automated message to warn customers they may be 
subject to a wait before they are able to discuss their account with a member  of the fraud  
department. And this enables customers to use their discretion as to whether they wish to 
remain on hold or call back at a more convenient  time. Mr M believes that NatWest should  
use different automated messages  to reflect that call volumes may vary during the day. He 
thinks a generic message is misleading.  But it wouldnt be reasonable for NatWest to change  
its hold messages throughout the day. And Im not persuaded  that the use of a generic 
automated message about hold and waiting times  by NatWest  is inappropriate.
 Mr M is unhappy  with the security  questions he was asked when he spoke with the fraud 
department. But banks have a duty to have robust strategies to safeguard customer 
accounts from potentially  unauthorised or fraudulent access by others who arent  the 
Ref: DRN00681213account holder.  Preventing  fraud  is as important  for the bank as it is for its customers. To do 
so a bank may ask customers  contacting  it answer security questions  in efforts to verify it is 
speaking with the account holder.
Theres nothing to suggest that the questions NatWest asked Mr M were anything  other than 
proper. And Im persuaded they were asked by NatWest in efforts to ascertain whether it 
was Mr M with whom it was speaking. I think NatWest followed its procedure  on maintaining 
account security. It asked  these questions in the interests of safeguarding the security of 
Mr Ms account until it could confirm it was speaking with him. I think  this was entirely 
reasonable. So, Im not persuaded NatWest did anything wrong here.
NatWest has accepted that it missed an opportunity to record a complaint on 18 December 
2018 when Mr M contacted it to query  the letter he had received. And Mr M said NatWest 
didnt contact him after this date to discuss his concerns or to formalise  his complaint until 
after he made contact  again. 
NatWest has apologised for not responding to Mr Ms request to register  a complaint as 
proactively as it shouldve done. And I can see that, once this complaint was recorded,  
NatWest responded  to it promptly and fully. I say this because  it issued  its final response to 
Mr M on 16 January 2019. So, while I think the delay here in NatWest trying  to resolve this 
complaint was minimal  I acknowledge that not having his complaint escalated properly 
would, most  likely, have caused  distress  and inconvenience to Mr M. And, in recognition  of 
this its credited his account with £50 compensation.
Its clear Mr M doesnt think this adequately resolves the issues raised in his complaint.  But 
while I acknowledge Mr Ms strength of feelings  here, I think  the overall  compensation 
NatWest has already paid is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. I say this because its 
in line with the levels of compensation we tell businesses to pay in similar situations. So, I 
wont be ordering NatWest to pay any more  than it has paid.
my final decision
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 June  2019.
