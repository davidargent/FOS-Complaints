K820x#14complaint
Mr L complains  that National Westminster Bank Plc hasnt treated him fairly when he is in 
financial difficulty. He wants  to close his account with them  but hasnt been able to.
background
Mr L first complained to NatWest in January 2018. He wants  to close his account and 
arrange a payment plan to repay his overdraft, but he says NatWest havent let him do this. 
He says hes told NatWest a number of times that he is suffering financial difficulties, but 
they havent helped him.
Mr L made a second formal complaint  in July 2018. Both times  he has complained  NatWest  
have given Mr L refunds  for charges and interest  they applied,  bringing his account  back  
within its agreed overdraft  limit. But they have continued to apply new charges to his 
account, meaning his balance  has exceeded  the agreed overdraft  limit again.  This in turn 
attracts further charges,  causing Mr L great  stress and anxiety.
Mr L is unhappy that he hasnt been able to close his account.  And he thinks  NatWest  
should have stopped applying charges  to it as he is in financial difficulty. NatWest feel that 
they have treated Mr L fairly. They say he cannot  close his account  whilst it has an 
outstanding balance, and argue that he has never formally notified them that he is in 
financial hardship. 
Mr L brought his complaint to our service. Our investigator felt that NatWest  had acted 
reasonably and didnt uphold Mr Ls complaint. Mr L disagrees, so the case has been  
passed to me to review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I know  Mr L will be disappointed, but Ive 
reached the same conclusion as our investigator. I dont think  NatWest  have  treated  him 
unfairly. Ill explain why. 
Mr L is unhappy that he hasnt been able to close his accounts  with NatWest. He says he 
stopped using them in August 2017 when  he opened an account  with another  bank.  
NatWest have explained that Mr L has three accounts with them.  Two of them  have a nil 
balance and they are happy to close them for him. But his reward  current  account  is 
overdrawn. NatWest  have said they cannot close this account until he repays his overdraft 
and brings the balance  to nil. I think its reasonable that NatWest wont close  an account 
whilst there  is a debt outstanding  because the money is fairly owed to the bank. So I dont 
think they have  acted unfairly  by refusing to do so.
I understand Mr L thinks its unfair that he cant close  his account even though hes received 
letters from NatWest stating that they are closing it. However NatWest  have  explained that 
these were automated  letters sent as part of their debt management  process. They werent  
tailored to Mr Ls personal situation. I appreciate it would have been  frustrating  for Mr L to 
receive these letters  when NatWest were  not in fact closing his account.  But NatWest  were 
following their standard  process when they sent them.  So I dont think  it would be fair to say 
they have acted unreasonably.  Its not for me to tell NatWest what their standard process 
should be, or to ask them to change  it.
Ref: DRN80224712Because Mr Ls current account is overdrawn  by more than his agreed Â£2,000 limit, NatWest 
have been applying charges and interest. Mr L has acknowledged that NatWest are entitled  
to do this. And Im satisfied that theyve  applied these  charges in line with the terms and 
conditions of Mr Ls account. So I think they have  acted  fairly here.
I appreciate Mr L thinks that NatWest  should  have stopped applying charges and interest to 
his account because he is in financial difficulty.  NatWest says that Mr L has never  formally  
told them  this. I understand that Mr L told branch staff he was suffering financial difficulties. 
And I can see that he notified NatWest of this in a number of emails  when discussing his 
complaints. 
However I can also see that NatWest asked  him to contact them  to discuss  his financial  
difficulties further  on a number of occasions. Their first final response letter sent on 17 January 
2018 said If you would like to discuss your options  of repayment of the agreed  overdraft,  
please contact  our Credit  Review  Team  on 0800  015 2044. They reiterated this in an email 
sent on 13 February 2018 which  advised  As mentioned in our previous response, if you are 
having financial difficulty please contact the Credit Review  Team on 0800  015 20443.  
When Mr L complained  again  in July 2018  NatWest asked him to contact their Collections 
Team and gave  him their phone number. In their final response letter of 11 July 2018 they 
told him there were  two options  available whilst his account was under this team. He could 
contact them  to arrange a repayment  plan, or he could complete an income/expenditure  
form and make a repayment offer. They also told him where he could get free independent  
debt advice. And they sent him a leaflet with more  information about  dealing with debt. In an 
email sent on 25 July 2018 they explained  that they would  require him to supply more 
information before they could consider his financial hardship. And they told him that if he 
were to make an acceptable  proposal  they would  suspend  charges on his account. 
Its common practice when a customer says they are in financial difficulty  for a bank to ask for 
some further  information so that they can assess their situation and decide what action its 
appropriate to take. I think  NatWest  tried to do this when they asked Mr L him to contact their 
teams. Im not aware that Mr L contacted NatWest as directed on either occasion. I appreciate 
he thinks NatWest should have done more  than give him contact details and ask him to call 
them. But I think NatWest made it clear to him what the next step was if he needed help. Mr L 
says he wants NatWest  to put a payment  plan in place to help him repay his overdraft. I can 
see that both times he complained NatWest explained that this was an option. And I think Mr L 
could reasonably have followed it up by calling  the correct department. 
The relevant  guidelines require banks  to take a positive  and sympathetic  approach  to 
customers experiencing financial difficulties. But they dont set out how the bank should do 
this  there are a number of steps a bank can take to help customers in this situation. So I 
should point out that even if they thought  he was in financial difficulty, NatWest wouldnt 
automatically have  to stop applying charges to Mr Ls account.
Whilst I agree Mr L hasnt given NatWest  enough information to assess  whether he is in 
financial difficulty, I think they have acted sympathetically towards him on both occasions  he 
has complained  to them. They refunded the charges and interest that took his account  over 
its agreed overdraft limit. They also advised  him that he would need to credit  the account  on 
an on-going basis  to cover any future charges. 
Ref: DRN80224713Mr L says that NatWests charges have prevented him from being able to stay within his 
agreed overdraft limit. But I can see that Mr L has continued to use the account over this 
period, and on a number  of occasions  has exceeded  his overdraft limit when making  point of 
sale transactions. So I dont think that the charges applied by NatWest  are the sole reason 
for the charges that have been applied to his account.
I sympathise with Mr Ls situation,  but I dont think NatWest have acted unreasonably or 
unfairly towards him for the reasons I have explained above.  I suggest if he has not already 
done so Mr L should  contact NatWest  to discuss his situation. NatWest have told us that he 
can speak to their Financial Difficulties Team and they will ask for further information in order  
to consider what they can do to help him. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint against National  Westminster Bank 
Plc for the reasons outlined above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 February  2019.
