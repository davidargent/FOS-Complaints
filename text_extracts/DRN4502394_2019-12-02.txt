K820x#14Complaint
Mr C is unhappy with the way that NewDay Ltd dealt with a chargeback  request he made.
Background
Mr C had a credit card with NewDay. On 16 November 2018 he said he was forced to make  
a payment to a business for £1,000  by giving his card details. Mr C called NewDay  
immediately after to explain the situation and ask them to complete a chargeback. NewDay 
said this wouldnt be an issue but Mr C would need to call back  once the payment had 
debited his card.
On 20 November 2018, Mr C called NewDay back as agreed but he was told hed been  
given incorrect information  on the first call. They explained it wasnt possible for them to 
make a chargeback  claim for him as they didnt have  enough  information  about the payment. 
So, they asked  Mr C for more information  about the payment, but he didnt want to provide it. 
Mr C was unhappy NewDay  wouldnt make  the chargeback claim as agreed, and he also felt 
the call handler  had been rude. So, he raised  a complaint. 
NewDay upheld the complaint in part. They  agreed  that Mr C had been given poor service 
by the second call hander and offered him £15 for the inconvenience. But they said they 
couldnt make the chargeback claim hed asked  for. Mr C didnt think  this was acceptable  as 
he wanted the £1,000  returned. So, he asked this service to look in-to his complaint.
The investigator didnt  recommend the complaint be upheld.  He said that before a 
chargeback can be made, card issuers must check the nature of the problem  to see if a 
claim is likely to succeed. Thats because  chargeback is a voluntary scheme  operated by 
Mastercard. The rules of the scheme  are set by Mastercard, not NewDay.  And NewDay  
wasnt obligated to raise a chargeback if it thought a claim wouldnt be likely  to succeed. 
Our investigator said NewDay had tried to obtain  the information they needed from Mr C. 
However, Mr C wouldnt  provide the information  required for them  to agree there  were  
grounds for a chargeback.  And because NewDay couldnt confirm  this they werent  able to 
proceed with the chargeback request. He also said NewDay had offered Mr C a further £50 
to apologise for the poor service received, and he felt the £65 compensation for the poor 
service received on the second call was reasonable under the circumstances.
Mr C didnt agree. He said he was told when he made the first call to NewDay  that the 
payment wouldnt  go through  so he was unhappy  that it had. He also said hed given 
evidence to NewDay to show the payment had been made under duress. So, he asked for 
his complaint to be looked at by an ombudsman.    
My findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive decided not to 
uphold it, for the same  reasons  as the investigator.
When Mr C contacted NewDay  they agreed  to help him with his dispute.  Mr C said he was 
told when he first contacted NewDay and explained  the circumstance that the payment 
wouldnt go through, but Im not persuaded thats the case.  Ive looked at the information 
Ref: DRN45023942provided by both parties and Im satisfied that NewDay told Mr C he needed  to call back 
once the transaction had cleared.
NewDay were prepared  to make a chargeback claim if it was appropriate to do so. But they 
couldnt pursue  it for Mr C, or try to help him get his money back in another way without 
further information. Thats because NewDay needed  to understand the relevant 
circumstances, for them to determine  the best way to help him. 
Ive listened to the call between Mr C and NewDay on 20 November 2019  and heard  that 
they asked Mr C for further information  about  the transaction. Mr C repeatedly said he didnt 
authorise the payment and hed been told to raise a chargeback by the Citizens  Advice 
Bureau. NewDay explained they needed to understand what  had happened to see whether 
this would fit the chargeback rules and without  this information they wouldnt be able to build 
a case to complete  a chargeback for Mr C. I recognise Mr C felt that by telling NewDay the 
transaction was unauthorised and sending them the card slip which said the payment was 
made under duress this should have been  enough. But unfortunately, NewDay needed to 
understand more  about how the transaction was made and despite  being told this several  
times, Mr C still didnt  want to provide the required information.
When Mr C didnt give NewDay the information they needed, they didnt think there  were  any 
grounds to pursue the matter further.  I think this was a reasonable decision in the 
circumstances as NewDay cant bypass  the chargeback rules and requirements set out by 
the card scheme.
I recognise Mr C said he was unhappy with the level of service received from Newsdays call 
handler. But theyve  said sorry, paid Mr C £15 as gesture of goodwill and offered to pay him 
a further £50. So, Im satisfied NewDay  acknowledged Mr Cs complaint and I think their 
offer of £65 total compensation is reasonable for the trouble and upset caused.   
My final decision
NewDay has already  made an offer to pay Mr C a further £50 to settle  the complaint. Mr C 
should contact  NewDay directly if he wishes to accept this.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 2 January 2020.
