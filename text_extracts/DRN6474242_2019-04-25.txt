K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC (trading  as QuickQuid)  lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
background
Mr H was given 21 loans  by QuickQuid between December 2010 and May 2014. Most  of the 
loans were repayable  in two or three monthly instalments, and two were  topped  up by taking 
some additional  borrowing  shortly after the original  loan.  The final loan was a FlexCredit  loan 
that provided Mr H with a revolving credit facility. All of Mr Hs loans have been fully repaid  
and a summary of his borrowing  from QuickQuid is shown in an appendix to this decision.
When Mr H first complained to QuickQuid it said that his complaint  about the first nine loans 
had been made too late. So Mr H has confirmed to us that he no longer wishes to complain 
about those loans. So in this decision I will only consider loans 10 to 21. But I will of course 
take account of the earlier  loans when looking at Mr Hs relationship with QuickQuid.
In its response to Mr Hs complaint QuickQuid offered to refund a late fee that Mr H had 
been charged on loan 18. But it didnt agree it had been wrong to give any of the loans to 
him. Mr H declined  that offer and brought his complaint to this Service.
Mr Hs complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. She didnt think that 
QuickQuid should  have given any of the loans I am considering here to Mr H. So she asked 
the lender to pay Mr H compensation  for each of those  loans.  QuickQuid didnt agree with 
that assessment.  So, as the complaint hasnt been  resolved informally, it has been passed to 
me, an ombudsman, to decide.  This is the last stage of our process.  If Mr H accepts my 
decision it is legally binding on both parties.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Mr H could repay the loans in a sustainable  manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different  things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and 
the consumers  income  and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early  stages of a lending  
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Ref: DRN64742422the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Mr H could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether  the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Office  of Fair Trading guidance on Irresponsible Lending, and 
later the Consumer Credit  Sourcebook (CONC),  define sustainable  as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Hs complaint.
Looking at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending history with Mr H I think by the first loan 
I am considering here (loan 10) the lender should  reasonably have seen that further  lending  
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should  have realised  that it 
shouldnt provide any further loans.  
I say this because:
By the time Mr H asked for loan 10 hed been  borrowing  from QuickQuid for over 14 
months and he wasnt making  any inroads to the amount he owed the lender. By 
then Mr H had paid a considerable  amount of interest to QuickQuid to effectively 
service a debt over an extended period.
Mr H was generally provided with a new loan typically within a few days  of settling a 
previous one. So QuickQuid ought  to have realised it was more  likely than not Mr H 
was having to borrow further  to cover the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving 
in his finances and that Mr Hs indebtedness  was increasing unsustainably.
The amounts  that Mr H borrowed showed  an upwards trend. Whilst there  were  a few 
occasions that Mr H took a much smaller loan he generally  repaid that borrowing 
quickly before asking to take a significantly larger  loan shortly  afterwards.
I think that Mr H lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing  from loan 10 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Hs indebtedness by allowing  him 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
Ref: DRN64742423the sheer number  of loans and deferrals was likely to have had negative implications 
on Mr Hs ability  to access mainstream  credit  and so kept him in the market for these 
high-cost loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 10 to 21 and QuickQuid  should  put things right.
putting things right
I dont think QuickQuid should have agreed  to lend to Mr H after,  and including,  the loan that 
he took on 25 February 2012 (loan 10). So for each of those loans QuickQuid should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
The number of loans  taken from loan 10 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  10 to 21 should be removed from Mr Hs 
credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Mr H a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Hs complaint and direct CashEuroNet  UK LLC to put 
things right as detailed above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 25 May 2019.
