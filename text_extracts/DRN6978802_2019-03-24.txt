K820x#14complaint
Miss R complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) gave her incorrect  
information about her repayment plan and that it told her she could set up a new plan.
background
Miss R says she called  NatWest about a missed payment on her repayment plan and was 
told she had five days to make a payment before the plan broke.  She says she was later told 
the plan would break in two days.  Miss R also says she was told by NatWests  complaint 
department that she could  set up new repayment  plan but she was later told by its debt 
management department that she couldnt.
NatWest doesnt  accept making a mistake and says its set up about nine or ten plans for 
Miss R and doesnt accept telling her it could arrange another.  It says it told Miss R during 
the call that she needed to bring her account  up to date within two days  to avoid the 
repayment plan breaking.
Miss R brought  her complaint to us but our investigator didnt think NatWest had acted 
unfairly or made a mistake. He thought NatWest had told Miss R on a number of occasions  
that the plan could break unless payments were made and didnt think there was any 
mention of five days on NatWests records or during the calls. The investigator didnt think  
there was any record of Miss R being  told she could set up a new plan but in any event 
thought the position  was explained to her when she called its debt management  department. 
The investigator thought overall NatWest had acted positively and sympathetically towards 
Miss R and had tried to help her.
Miss R doesnt accept that view and isnt happy  NatWest cant  provide a copy  of the call in 
which she says she was told a new repayment plan could be set up. She says NatWest  
should offer a new plan as it said it would. She also maintains she was told the plan would 
break in five days when  she called NatWest.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so Ive come to the same 
overall conclusions  as the investigator  for the same  reasons. I realise  Miss R will be 
disappointed by my decision. 
Ive listened to all of the available  calls between  NatWest  and Miss R and Ive looked at 
NatWest records of those  calls and its internal notes about the debt history. Having  done  so 
Im satisfied that at no stage was Miss R told that she had five days  to make  a payment into 
her account  to avoid  the repayment plan breaking. Im satisfied she was told that the plan 
would break  and the implications for her if it did unless payments were made within two 
days. I also think Miss R was told during the calls that she couldnt set up a new plan if the 
present one was broken.
Banks and building societies should treat customers in financial difficulties positively  and 
sympathetically. And I think NatWest has acted  in such a way here. I can see that its agreed 
about nine previous repayment plans with Miss R that have unfortunately been broken.  So I 
dont think its acted  unfairly by refusing to set up a new repayment plan in these 
circumstances.
Ref: DRN69788022I appreciate Miss R says she was told she could set up a new repayment  plan when she 
called to complain.  I cant see a record  of that call or conversation. But I dont think  it matters  
as when Miss R did call NatWests debt department she  was given the correct information 
in any event a short while later. I also think as I have explained that Miss R was told during a 
call I have listened to that a new plan wouldnt be set up if the present one was broken.
Overall Im satisfied NatWest has dealt fairly with Miss Rs complaint and that it has tried to 
help her. For those  reasons I cant fairly order it to agree a new repayment plan with Miss R 
as she would like.
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 25 April 2019.
