Our adjudicator thought the loans from loan 5 onwards  shouldnt  have been given. 
Mr Lender didnt agree, so the complaint was passed to me.
In my provisional decision (which forms part of this final decision)  I set out why I was 
planning to uphold the complaint in part. I thought the loans from loan 6 onwards shouldnt 
have been given. I asked Miss W and Mr Lender to let me have any more  information by 9 
January 2020  before  I made a final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Our general approach to complaints 
about short-term  lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry 
practice  is set out on our website, and Ive followed it here.
   
Both Miss W and Mr Lender responded to my provisional decision saying they had no further 
information to add. So I have no reason to change the findings or outcome  set out in my 
provisional decision. 
It follows Im upholding the complaint about  loans  6 and 7, and Mr Lender  will have to put 
things right. 
putting things right  what Mr Lender  must  do
refund  all interest and charges Miss W paid on loans  6 and 7;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan 6 from Miss Ws credit file
Ref: DRN21214542any information recorded about  loan 7 is adverse, so the entry  about  loan 7 should 
be removed from Miss Ws credit  file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest.  Mr Lender must give 
Miss W a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
my final decision
My decision  is I uphold  this complaint in part. PDL Finance Limited (trading as Mr Lender) 
must compensate Mr S as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss W to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 February  2020.

my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
Mr Lender needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure 
Miss W could  repay  the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a 
number of different things,  such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages  of a lending  relationship, I 
think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.   
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Mr Lender should  fairly and reasonably have done more 
to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer.  These factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Ref: DRN21214544I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Mr Lender was required to establish whether 
Miss W could  sustainably repay her loans   not just whether the loan payments  were affordable on a 
strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might  be an indication a consumer could  
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the Office  of Fair Trading guidance on Irresponsible Lending,  and later the Consumer Credit  
Sourcebook (CONC)  defines sustainable as being without undue  difficulties  and in particular  
the customer  should  be able to make  repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this context and 
what this all means for Miss Ws complaint.
There was a significant break  in Miss Ws borrowing from Mr Lender.  There was a gap of over six 
months between loans  1 and 2. I think it would have been reasonable with for 
Mr Lender to view that gap as an indication that Miss Ws finances had stabilised after whatever the 
circumstances that had caused her to take out loan 1. So I will look at Miss Ws borrowing  in two 
separate lending chains.
Im currently  planning to uphold the complaint from loan 6 onwards. Ill explain why.
I dont think there was anything to indicate Mr Lender needed to do more when it approved  loans 1 to 
5. It asked for details of her income and expenditure and carried  out credit checks. And I havent seen 
anything in the information  it gathered that I think should have led it to reach  different lending 
decisions. So I dont  think Mr Lender was wrong  to give loans 1 to 5 to Miss W.
However I dont think Mr Lender carried  out proportionate checks for loan 6. Had it done so I think  it 
would have made a different  lending decision. I say this because by loan 6 there were clear signs that 
Miss W was struggling to manage her money. Proportionate  checks would have shown that Miss W 
had at least four other active short term loans with different lenders. I think this would have suggested 
to Mr Lender that Miss Ws finances were under pressure.  It was most likely she was just borrowing  to 
pay off other loans. And that this loan was unlikely  to be sustainably affordable  for Miss W. It was for 
a significantly larger amount  that any of her previous loans. It follows I dont think  Mr Lender should 
have given loan 6 to Miss W.
Ive then looked at the overall pattern of Mr Lenders lending history with Miss W, with a view to 
seeing if there  was a point at which  Mr Lender should reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Mr Lender should have realised  that it shouldnt  have 
provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Miss Ws case, I think that this point was reached at loan 7. I 
say this, considering solely the second chain of lending,  because:
Loan  6 had a six-month term but Miss W repaid it over 12 months.  This should have 
suggested to Mr Lender her indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Miss Ws first loan was for £150 and loan 7 was for £300. At this point  Mr Lender ought to 
have known  that Miss W was not likely  borrowing  to meet  a temporary  shortfall in her income 
but to meet an ongoing  need.  
Ref: DRN21214545Miss W wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Mr Lender.  Loan 7 was taken 
out three years after Miss Ws first. And it was for a larger amount.  Miss W had paid large  
amounts of interest to, in effect, service  a debt to Mr Lender  over an extended period. 
I think  that Miss W lost out because Mr Lender continued to provide borrowing for loan 7 because:
this loan had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Miss Ws indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
this loan was likely to have had negative implications on Miss Ws ability to access  
mainstream credit  and so kept her in the market for these high-cost  loans.
I have carefully considered  Mr Lenders  response to our adjudicators view. I note it was unhappy with 
the lack of detail in the adjudicators findings. I have set out the reasons  why I am planning  to uphold 
the complaint from loan 6 onwards, and hope they will assist  
Mr Lender to understand why I have reached this conclusion. I note, of relevance to my provisional  
decision, is Mr Lenders point that there was a gap in lending of over three months between  loans 6 
and 7. It says this is evidence that Miss W wasnt persistently reliant on short term loans. But I 
disagree that this on its own outweighs  the other indicators detailed above. I think taking all the 
characteristics of Miss Ws borrowing relationship  into account  ought  to have indicated  to Mr Lender 
that further lending wasnt sustainable for 
Miss W.
So Im currently  planning to uphold  the complaint  about loans 6 onwards, and Mr Lender will have to 
put things right. 
putting things  right  what Mr Lender  will needs to do
refund all interest and charges Miss W paid on loans  6 and 7;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid to the date of settlement*;
remove any negative information about loan 6 from Miss Ws credit file
any information recorded about loan 7 is adverse, so the entry  about  loan 7 should  be 
removed from Miss Ws credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  Mr Lender to take off tax from this interest.  Mr Lender must give 
Miss W a certificate showing  how much tax its taken off if she asks for one. 
my provisional  decision
My provisional  decision  is that I am upholding  this complaint in part, and PDL Finance  Limited (trading 
as Mr Lender) will have to compensate Miss W as set out above.
