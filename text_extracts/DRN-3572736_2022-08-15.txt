The complaint
Mr C complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA failed to refund a transaction he didnt 
recognise.
What happened
Mr C became aware that a payment had been made from his PayPal account to a merchant 
Ill refer to as V. Mr Cs wife had an account with V and Mr C had enabled an agreement 
some years earlier for V to take payments from his PayPal account.
Mr C told PayPal that he hadnt authorised the payment to V and he thought that his account 
has been compromised. PayPal investigated Mr Cs claim and found that the payment had 
been made because of the earlier agreement with V. This agreement enabled V to take 
payments from PayPal and had been successfully used several times over the previous 
years. Mr C asked PayPal for details of how to get in touch with V and was left frustrated 
with their approach to his concerns. 
PayPal couldnt find any unauthorised activity on Mr Cs account and because the payment 
was made with an existing agreement with V, they declined to refund Mr C. The billing 
agreement with V was cancelled, but Mr C remained unhappy and complained to PayPal 
about the situation. Mr Cs wife had also tried to find out more about the payment from V, but 
with little success.
PayPal looked into Mr Cs complaint and confirmed that no unauthorised access had been 
made to the account. PayPal explained that the payment to V was for digital goods. They 
declined to make a refund to Mr C.
Mr C then brought his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service for an independent 
review. It was looked into by one of our investigators who didnt uphold Mr Cs complaint. 
They considered the billing agreement was evidence that the payment was authorised.
Mr C disagreed with the investigators outcome, commenting that PayPal had data that 
would assist his complaint, that the billing agreements were opaque and allowed the 
merchants to take payments with little chance of recourse. Mr C asked for a further review of 
his complaint which has now been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr C linked his PayPal account a few years ago through a billing agreement with V to enable 
transactions to be taken for services provided by them. Mr C believes these agreements are 
opaque and prevent a proper investigation of any fraudulent use of the PayPal account. 
When a billing agreement is set up with the merchant, PayPal accept that this is a trusted 
source, so when the merchant makes a request for payment based on the agreement, its 
considered to be authorised. PayPals terms set this out in more detail.
The billing agreement referred to here by Mr C was with V, and PayPal specifically explain 
that they dont know the background or details to the agreement. PayPal are providing a 
means to settle the payments requests made by V.
I appreciate Mr C thinks the agreements are opaque, but here the agreement was set up 
with V, so once PayPal have this authority lodged with them, I dont think its unreasonable 
for them to process payment requests through it. Having said that, PayPal are also required 
to assist Mr C when he told them this payment wasnt made with his authority.
PayPal have their own mechanism for investigating unauthorised transactions and when Mr 
C told them he thought his account was compromised, they looked into it. PayPal couldnt 
find any evidence of unauthorised access to the account and once they saw that the 
transaction was processed under the billing agreement  they took no further action because 
they believed it had been properly authorised.
Im not convinced that PayPals approach to this issue has necessarily helped Mr C here. 
Once PayPal realised the payment was made via a billing agreement, they dont seem to 
have taken any further action. PayPal stated that they investigated Mr Cs claim that his 
account was compromised. But Mr C was telling PayPal that he hadnt authorised this 
transaction. Whilst the billing agreement enabled V to take a payment, it doesnt provide for 
V to take a payment that Mr C hasnt authorised. I dont think PayPal acted in the best 
interests of Mr C and could have taken his issue back to V to test how the payment was 
made rather than just relying on the billing agreement.
Mr C believed PayPal had information that would support his assertion that his account had 
been compromised and PayPal were asked to provide any location data they held. Ive 
reviewed that information and it shows a consistent location for the use of Mr Cs account 
around the time of the disputed transaction. There doesnt appear to be any evidence that 
the PayPal account was compromised. 
Overall, the evidence does show that V requested a payment through an agreement set up 
by Mr C that was linked to his partners account (with V). The agreement had been in place 
for some time to make previous payments that hadnt been disputed. PayPal received 
information about the transaction that showed it was for a digital product  most probably 
some form of online game. 
When Mr C linked his payment method to his partners account, there was a greater risk of 
being held accountable for transactions he didnt recognise. Thats because he passed 
authority to another person to use his payment facility with PayPal. Whilst I accept that was 
his partner who was unlikely to misuse the account, it still builds in another link away from 
the control of payments by Mr C. Effectively he was allowing someone elses account with V 
to take payments from his PayPal account. 
I think it would be difficult to unpick who did what with Vs account and looking at the 
transactions made from it, theyre few and far between. This indicates the user of the 
account wasnt a typical fraudster out to gain as much money from Mr C as quickly as 
possible. 
Overall, I do think PayPal could have better assisted Mr C with his claim, but I dont think the 
outcome would likely have been any different. Thats because I think it would be difficult to 
show that an unauthorised third party used the account (with V). Also, I think by linking to 
another account that didnt belong to Mr C, this would complicate the issue of authorisation. 
Thats because other parties had the ability to make transactions from the account with V that wasnt under the direct control of Mr C in a way that looked like he would have 
authorised them himself.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 September 2022.
