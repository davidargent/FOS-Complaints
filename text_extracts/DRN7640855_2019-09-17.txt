K821x#15complaint
Miss A complains  that PDL Finance Limited  (trading as Mr Lender) was irresponsible  to lend 
to her.
background
Miss A had five loans  from Mr Lender between January  2017  and September 2017 as 
follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Due Repayment* Repaid
1 26 Jan 2017 £300 3m 21 Apr 2017 £162.40 Ext, 19 May 2017
2 21 May 2017 £500 6m 21 Nov 2017 £207.33 Canc 1 Jun 2017
3 6 Jun 2017 £400 6m 21 Nov 2017 £144.66 Extended, repaid 
early, 5 Aug 2017
4 1 Sep 2017 £500 6m 21 Feb 2018 £180.00 22 Sep 2017
5 26 Sep 2017 £1,000 6m 21 Mar 2018 £380.00 Repayment plan, 
paid 5 Nov 2017
* Maximum  monthly  repayment over the term of the loan
Miss A says she doesnt  believe Mr Lender carried out proper affordability checks. She says 
if it had done so, it would have seen  she had a severe gambling addiction and was in a debt 
spiral.
Mr Lender says it carried out affordability  and credit checks at the time of each application. It 
says there  was nothing  in Miss As credit file that indicated she was struggling financially. It 
also says the information  provided by Miss A about her income and expenditure showed she 
had sufficient disposable income  to make the repayments.
Mr Lender says Miss A paid interest only for one of the instalments  of loan 1, thereby 
extending the term by one month.  She then settled this loan on time. It says she also did the 
same for loan 3, but then settled the loan early.  Following the early settlement of loan 4, 
Miss A told Mr Lender  she couldnt make the first repayment on loan 5. Mr Lender agreed a 
repayment plan for the loan, but Miss A then settled it early.
Our adjudicator recommended  the complaint should  be upheld in part. He wasnt satisfied 
that Mr Lenders checks went far enough  for loans 3, 4 and 5 and found that had it done  
better checks, its likely  Mr Lender  would have  found  loans 4 and 5 to be unaffordable. He 
recommended that Mr Lender should  refund interest and charges on loans 4 and 5 (plus  8% 
statutory interest) and remove any associated negative information from Miss As credit  
record.
Mr Lender offered to settle loan 5 in line with the adjudicators recommendation, but 
disagreed about  loan 4. It said it had asked Miss A about her other short-term loans at the 
time of this loan and the credit check showed  no evidence of any additional short-term  
lending.
Miss A did not accept  this offer.
Ref: DRN76408552my provisional findings
I issued a provisional decision to Mr Lender and to Miss A on 9 August 2019. I summarise  
my findings  here:
I found that Mr Lender had carried out proportionate checks  for loans 1, 2 and 3 and 
that, based on the available  information, it did nothing wrong by approving the loans;
By loan 4, I thought  Miss As borrowing  pattern should have indicated to Mr Lender 
that she may be in financial difficulty so it needed to do more thorough checks;
I considered Mr Lender should have asked  Miss A whether she had any other  short-
term loans  at this stage;
Mr Lender provided a call transcript to show it asked Miss A questions about  short-
term loans. Although  I didnt find these questions were specific  enough, it also 
provided evidence that the documentation  asked for a figure for Other loans, including 
short-term loans;
Miss A declared the two short-term loans she had in response to the information 
request, and I was satisfied  the credit check didnt  show any other  short-term  loans;
So I found there was nothing in the information provided, or the information of which  
Mr Lender should  have  been aware, which indicated loan 4 was unaffordable;
Mr Lender agreed with the adjudicators recommendation for loan 5, so I didnt 
consider it further.
My provisional decision was that Mr Lender should  refund  interest and charges on loan 5 
(+8% statutory interest) and remove negative information about it from Miss As credit  file.
Mr Lender accepted the provisional decision,  but Miss A did not respond to it.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party provided any additional  information,  I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional decision.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint in part. PDL Finance Limited  (trading as 
Mr Lender) should  do the following, as it has offered to do:
Refund all interest  and charges that Miss A paid on loan 5;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on all refunds from payment date to settlement date*;
Remove  any negative  information about  loan 5 from Miss As credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Mr Lender  to take off tax from this interest. Mr Lender 
must give Miss A a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mss A to accept or 
reject my decision  before 17 October  2019.
