K820x#14complaint
Ms J complains  about  poor handling  of her investment 
portfolio by Barclays  Bank PLC. She says her 
investments havent been  managed in line with her 
attitude to risk, and that shes  lost a significant amount 
of capital as a result. 
Background
Ms J had invested  with Barclays since  1997. Shed 
complained about  poor performance of  her portfolio  in 
2005, and Barclays paid compensation in recognition 
that some  of its advice may not have been suitable. Ms 
J accepted the payment  in settlement of her complaint. 
So our adjudicator said we couldnt look at  Ms Js 
complaint about events before  2005, as these had 
already been dealt with by Barclays.
Barclays advised Ms J when  she moved her 
investments to new products in 2009. She said that by 
that time shed lost £192,000 from her original 
investment of £362,000. Ms J said she had a cautious 
attitude to risk, and that she wanted to protect  her 
capital.
Ref: DRN33367992Barclays advised Ms J again when she  made further 
investments in 2011.
Barclays provided details  of Ms Js investments, 
including the income withdrawals shed made. Our 
adjudicator thought  Ms J probably hadnt taken those 
withdrawals into account  when shed looked  at the value 
of her portfolio.
Ms J had withdrawn roughly 4% of the value of her 
portfolio each  year between 1997 and 2008 (when the 
original investment was surrendered). When the 
adjudicator took account of these withdrawals, and 
added them to the remaining  value of the investments, 
he didnt  find that Ms J had suffered any loss. He wasnt 
persuaded that Barclays had invested  in a way that was 
out of line with Ms Js attitude to risk or investment 
objectives.  
Ms J didnt  agree with the adjudicators conclusions, so 
the complaint  has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and 
arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
In 2016 Barclays accepted its advice to Ms J in 2009 
and 2011  wasnt suitable. It offered her £8,423, which it 
said represented the loss shed  made  on those 
investments. 
Ref: DRN33367993Barclays also offered  £850 to cover any financial advice 
Ms J wanted to take in connection with rearranging the 
2009 and 2011 investments. I understand that Ms J 
accepted the £850, but not the £8,423 that Barclays had 
offered.
Following Barclays offer, Ms J complained that she 
didnt know what had happened  to the Woolwich  Plan 
Manager investments shed made in 2008, and that she 
didnt know which of her other  investments were still  in 
place.
Barclays explained that the Woolwich investments were 
closed in 2013, and it also listed the other investments 
Ms J held. Barclays accepted  it had taken  too long to 
deal with Ms Js complaint and offered her £100. It later 
increased this by another £150.
As the investigator explained, we cant look at the 
investments Ms J complained  about in 2005, because 
that complaint has been  made too late for the purpose of 
our rules. Ms J also accepted compensation from 
Barclays in 2005, in full and final settlement of that 
complaint.
Ms J says that by 2009 shed  lost a significant amount of 
her capital through inappropriate investment in high risk 
holdings. But from what Ive seen, Im not persuaded 
thats the case.  I say this because Ive looked  at the 
value of Ms Js original investment in 1997 (£219,000) 
and the surrender  values in 2005  and 2008 when that 
investment was cashed (approximately  £204,600).  Im 
Ref: DRN33367994also aware that Ms J took income from the investment 
between 1997 and 2008. I think its  likely  that the total 
income taken, in addition to the surrender values,  would 
be more than the value of Ms Js original investment.
That means I dont think  Ms J suffered any overall loss 
on her investment between 1997 and 2008.
Ms J invested again through  Barclays in 2009  and 2011.  
Barclays accepted its advice  in connection with those 
investments wasnt suitable. It calculated Ms  J had lost 
£8,423 because of the unsuitable  advice. 
I understand Ms J didnt accept Barclays offer,  but she 
took the £850 it offered to cover any financial advice she  
wanted to take in connection with rearranging her 
investments. I understand that Ms J has kept the 
investments.
It seems Ms J thought  Barclays  offer of £8,423 was in 
connection with the capital she considered shed lost  
between 1997 and 2008. But thats not the case.  The 
offer reflects  what Barclays  says Ms J lost  on the 
investments she made in 2009 and 2011, because  of 
the unsuitable  advice she received. 
I think its reasonable  for Barclays to allow  Ms J to 
decide whether or not she now wants  to accept that offer 
 although  I think she should  make her decision  no later 
than one month after the date on which  she accepts  my 
final decision.
Ref: DRN33367995Barclays should also pay £250 to Ms  J in recognition  of 
its poor complaint handling.
my final decision
My decision is that Barclays Bank PLC should  pay £250 
to Ms J.
Barclays Bank PLC should  also allow Ms J to decide 
whether or not she now wants  to accept its offer of 
£8,423 that was made in connection with unsuitable 
advice in 2009 and 2011. Ms J should make her 
decision no later than one month after the date  on which  
she accepts this final decision
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, 
Im required to ask Ms J to accept or reject  my decision 
before 11 February 2019.
