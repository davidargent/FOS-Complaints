The complaint
Mr L complains that a car that was supplied to him under a hire purchase agreement with Go 
Car Credit Limited wasnt of satisfactory quality.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a used car was supplied to Mr L under a hire purchase agreement with Go Car Credit 
that he electronically signed in December 2019;
Go Car Credit, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory quality will 
depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the car and the 
price that was paid for it;
the car that was supplied to Mr L was more than seven years old, had been driven for 
nearly 47,500 miles and had a price of Â£5,784;
Mr L complained to Go Car Credit Limited about some issues with the car in 
February 2020 and it said that he should take the car back to the dealer  that wasnt 
convenient for Mr L so it offered to contribute towards the cost of him taking the car 
back to the dealer or paying for a diagnostic test;
Mr L took the car to a garage for a diagnostic test in April 2020 and its mileage was 
recorded as 49,549 - fault codes for the front lambda sensor and the temperature 
sensor were found;
Mr L stopped making payments to Go Car Credit for the car and says that he made a 
statutory off-road notification about the car;
the car was then inspected by an independent expert in August 2020 to identify the 
cause of the fault codes  the cars mileage at that time was recorded as 49,559 and 
the expert said that the sensors were faulty and needed to be replaced but the faults 
were due to wear and tear; 
Mr L didnt complain to Go Car Credit about the sensors until about two months after 
the car was supplied to him and he was able to drive the car for more than 2,000 
miles between December 2019 and April 2020 when the diagnostic test took place;
the independent expert says that the faults with the sensors are the result of wear 
and tear and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the faults 
were present when the car was supplied to Mr L or that the car wasnt of satisfactory 
quality at that time;
Mr L has complained to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency about some 
concerns he has about the cars MOT test history but Im not persuaded that those 
concerns are enough to show that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was 
supplied to him;
I sympathise with Mr L for the issues that hes had with the car but I consider that Go 
Car Credit has responded to his complaint fairly and reasonably; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Go Car Credit to allow Mr L to reject the car, to pay for it to be repaired, to pay him 
any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
I suggest that Mr L contacts Go Car Credit to try to agree a repayment arrangement for the 
arrears on his account. If he doesnt do so I consider it to be likely that it will take action, to 
the extent that its legally entitled to do so, to recover the amount that he owes to it. If Mr L is 
experiencing financial difficulties he should explain those difficulties to Go Car Credit. Its 
required to respond to any such difficulties positively and sympathetically.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 February 2021.
