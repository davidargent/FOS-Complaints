The complaint
Mr N complains that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him in an 
irresponsible manner.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in May 2020 that I summarise below.
Mr N was given 14 loans by Sunny between June 2015 and August 2016. Each of the loans 
was due to be repaid in six monthly instalments but Mr N often repaid the loans far earlier 
than had been agreed. At times Mr N had up to three loans outstanding at the same time. Mr 
N successfully repaid his first 11 loans, but he failed to repay the final three loans. The 
outstanding balance has been transferred to a third party debt recovery company. A 
summary of some of Mr N's borrowing from Sunny is as follows;

In my provisional decision I explained the basis on which I would decide the complaint, and 
in particular that the checks Sunny needed to do would need to take into account things 
such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and 
expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I thought less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
DRN-1930551I thought that the checks Sunny did before agreeing the first three loans were proportionate. 
So I didn't think it had been wrong for Sunny to agree to give these loans to Mr N.
I thought that Sunny should have done more checks before agreeing loans 4 to 6. But Mr N 
hadn't given us enough information for me to determine what better checks would have 
shown to the lender. So I wasn't able to say that Sunny had been wrong to agree these 
loans.
But I thought that, by the time of loan 7, Sunny should have realised that the overall pattern 
of Mr N's borrowing should have suggested that any further lending was unsustainable, or 
otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldn't provide further loans. 
I asked Sunny to pay Mr N some compensation in relation to loans 7 to 14.
Sunny hasn't responded to my provisional decision. Mr N has provided us with some 
additional comments. Although I am only summarising here what Mr N has said, I have 
considered his entire response carefully before writing this decision.
Mr N has said he is disappointed by my provisional decision and thinks the adjudicator's 
assessment was more fair. He says in other similar complaints his reliance on payday loans 
has been found to be established by around the 4th loan. He thinks it should have been 
clear to Sunny that he was in financial difficulty when he took out loan 2 (though I think he 
means loan 4) when he took a new loan just 10 days after repaying some previous 
borrowing. He thinks Sunny should have started asking more questions and been wary of his 
lending at that time. But Mr N has confirmed that he is unable to provide copies of his bank 
statements from around the time of the loans.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive once more considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so I remain happy with 
the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision.
I agree with Mr N that Sunny should have done more checks from around the time he asked 
for loan 4. But that in itself doesn't mean the complaint should be upheld. I would also need 
to be persuaded that those better checks would have led to Sunny declining his loan 
applications. That is why we asked Mr N for copies of his bank statements from that time - 
so we could see what better checks would have shown. As Mr N remains unable to give us 
that information I cannot reasonably conclude that better checks should have led to Sunny 
declining Mr N's applications from loan 4 onwards.
So I don't think it is reasonable to uphold Mr N's complaint about the first six loans. But I still 
don't think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr N from loan 7 onwards. Sunny needs to 
pay Mr N some compensation.
Putting things right
I dont think Sunny should have agreed to lend to Mr N after, and including, the loan that he 
took on 24 March 2016 (loan 7). So Sunny should;
refund all the interest and charges Mr N paid on loans 7 to 11
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
remove all information about loans 7 to 11 from Mr Ns credit file
If Sunny is able, and willing, to take loans 12 to 14 back into its own books, Sunny should;remove any interest and charges still outstanding on loans 12 to 14 and treat any
payments Mr N made towards these loans (including any payments made to the third
party) as payments towards the capital
if reworking these accounts as Ive directed results in Mr N effectively having made
payments above the original capital borrowed on any loan, then Sunny should refund
these overpayments with 8% simple interest calculated on the overpayments, from
the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of settlement.
if reworking these accounts leaves an amount of capital still to be paid on any loan,
then Sunny can use the total refund from the other loans (after the deduction of tax)
to offset this. And if there is still an outstanding capital balance on any loan then I
remind Sunny that it should take a sympathetic view when seeking to agree an
affordable repayment plan with Mr N
remove all information about loans 12 to 14 from Mr Ns credit file when each loan
has been fully repaid.
If Sunny does not take loans 12 to 14 back into its own books, Sunny should;
refund to Mr N all the interest and charges it added to loans 12 to 14, together with
any interest and charges added by the third party, so that Mr N can choose whether
to use the refund to reduce his debt.
liaise with the third party to remove all information about loans 12 to 14 from Mr Ns
credit file when each loan has been fully repaid.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must 
give Mr N a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold part of Mr Ns complaint and direct Elevate Credit 
International Limited to put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 July 2020.
