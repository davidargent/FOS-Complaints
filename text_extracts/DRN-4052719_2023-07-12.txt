The complaint
Ms W through her representative, complains that Morses Club PLC approved several 
home-credit loans for her and by doing that it lent to her irresponsibly.
What happened
Using the information I have from Morses, here is a brief loan table. Morses told us that
Ms W still owed a balance to debt collectors for loan 5. So, the May 2019 closure date for
loan 5 may refer to the date it was passed to that debt collector.

After Ms W had complained, the final response letter (FRL) from Morses was issued and
gave reasons why it did not consider it had lent irresponsibly.
Ms Ws representative referred it to the Financial Ombudsman Service where one of our
adjudicators considered the complaint. At first his view was that Morses had approved
loans 1 to 4 responsibly but not loan 5. After Morses had made various submissions, which
included details about how Ms W had obtained some cash to repay loan 4 early, then he
changed his view. He decided that Morses had not lent irresponsibly.
Ms W had agreed with the adjudicators first view and not with the second. And so, the
unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide.
On 8 June 2023 I issued a provisional decision and that is duplicated in the next section, but 
in smaller type, to differentiate it. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about this type of lending - including all
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Morses had to assess the lending to check if Ms W could afford to pay back the amounts
shed borrowed without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was
proportionate to the circumstances. Morses checks couldve taken into account a number of
different things, such as how much was being lent, the size of the repayments, and
Ms Ws income and expenditure.
I think in the early stages of a lending relationship, less thorough checks might have been 
proportionate. But certain factors might suggest Morses should have done more to establish 
that any lending was sustainable for Ms W. These factors include:
Ms W having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Ms W having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Ms W coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Ms W. Initially the adjudicator thought
this applied in Ms Ws complaint in relation to loan 5 only. But then he altered his view
because of the gap in the lending between loans 4 and 5, and because Ms W had appeared
to be able to repay loan 4 early which gave no indication of her being reliant on these loans.
Morses was required to establish whether Ms W could sustainably repay the loans  not just
whether she technically had enough money to make her repayments. Having enough money
to make the repayments could of course be an indicator that Ms W was able to repay her
loans sustainably. But it doesnt automatically follow that this is the case.
Industry regulations say that payments are sustainable if they are made without undue
difficulties and, made on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments and without
having to borrow to make them. If a lender realises, or ought reasonably to have realised,
that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments without borrowing further, then it
follows that it should conclude those repayments are unsustainable.
My provisional decision findings dated 8 June 2023. 
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and
thought about what this means for Ms Ws complaint.
Having looked at the complaint afresh, then my view is that Morses ought to have carried out a full 
financial review on Ms Ws circumstances and situation from loan 1. And I say that because the credit 
search it carried out in October 2016 (before loan 1) revealed that she had a County Court Judgment 
(CCJ) from just ten months earlier. And for a creditor to have got to the stage where it needed to go to 
Court for a Judgment against Ms W, then that must have been a long term debt.
Added to which, the credit search revealed that Ms W had five delinquent accounts and one
which had entered default status relatively recently. Ms W had declared to Morses relatively good 
income and her expenditure sums (as declared) did seem to indicate that she could afford the loans 
Morses approved for her. Here is a duplicate of the information Morses has sent to us about her 
income and her expenditure.Loan INCOME EXPENDITURE DISPOSABLE INCOME
1 £358.00 £210.00 £148.00
2 £431.00 £348.00 £83.00
3 £455.00 £331.00 £124.00
4 £435.00 £312.00 £123.00
5 £671.19 £385.00 £286.19
I consider that the CCJ plus the delinquencies ought to have prompted Morses to have obtained more 
information and not simply relied on the information Ms W had given it. Its own research had revealed 
adverse entries on her credit file but even with its propensity to offer to customers with poor credit 
records, still I think it ought to have checked the situation more thoroughly. And I dont think Morses 
did that.
Having said all that, I cant proceed to make an assessment on the information Morses may have 
discovered if it had done more thorough checks from loan 1. And that is because Ms Ws financial 
situation is not known to me.
And so, I am issuing a provisional decision, indicating that on current evidence I can only proceed on 
the information that Morses recorded when Ms W was applying for the loans. And on that evidence 
the loans looked affordable. But this provisional decision will give Ms W and her representative time to 
send to me additional information about her finances covering all or some of the lending relationship 
period, if they want to. So, on current evidence I plan not to uphold the complaint but I will review it in 
two weeks on 22 June 2023.
How did the parties respond?
Morses has not responded. Ms Ws representative did tell us that Ms W planned to send to 
us the copy bank statements to cover the lending relationship. I gave an extension of time 
for this to be done until 7 July 2023. Recently we have been informed that Ms Ws 
representative has had no documentation from Ms W and so it knows we will have to 
proceed to issue a final decision without it. In the circumstances, I have nothing to alter my 
view from my provisional findings. I do not uphold Ms Ws complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold the complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms W to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 August 2023.
