Mr P has had some problems repaying his final loan and based on the information that STF 
has provided this Service with, an outstanding balance remains as of February 2021. 
One of our adjudicators reviewed Mr Ps complaint. He didnt think STF had made an error 
when it provided loans 1  5. However, he concluded that by loan 6 STF ought to have 
realised the pattern of lending was harmful to Mr P. So, loans 6 - 17 shouldnt have been 
given. 
Mr P appears to have accepted the adjudicators findings. 
STF didnt agree with the adjudicators assessment. In response, it said;
It didnt do anything wrong in the way it dealt with Mr P. 
STF adhered to all relevant regulations at the time the loans were granted. 
Prior to November 2018 STF didnt have the ability to accept and keep copies of 
supporting documentation such as bank statements or bills. 
As no agreement has been reached the complaint has been passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending - including all 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
STF needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr P could
repay his loans in a sustainable manner.
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was
being lent, the repayment amounts, and the consumers income and expenditure. With this
in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be
reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might suggest STF should have done more to establish that any lending 
was sustainable for Mr P. These factors include: 
Mr P having a low income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income); 
The amounts to be repaid being especially high (reflecting that it could be more 
difficult to meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
Mr P having a large number of loans and/or having these loans over a long period of 
time (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had 
become, or was becoming, unsustainable);
Mr P coming back for loans shortly after previous borrowing had been repaid (also 
suggestive of the borrowing becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable for Mr P. The loan payments being 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case.
At the time these loans were lent, STF was regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. 
The FCAs Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) explained that payments are sustainable 
if they are made without undue difficulties and in particular, made on time, while meeting 
other reasonable commitments and without having to borrow to make them. If a lender 
realised, or ought reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make their 
repayments without borrowing further, then it follows that it should conclude those 
repayments are unsustainable. 
Ive considered all the arguments, evidence and information provided in this context, and 
thought about what this means for Mr Ps complaint.
Neither Mr P or his representative appear to disagree with our adjudicators findings about 
loans 1  5. So, I think there is no longer a dispute about these loans. And like the 
adjudicator, I would also agree, based on what Ive seen, that there isnt enough to be able to uphold the complaint about those loans.  So instead, this decision will focus on whether 
STF did anything wrong when it lent loans 6 to 17.  
I havent looked in any detail about whether the checks for loans 6 - 17 were proportionate 
and Ill explain why below. 
STF has provided this service with the copies of the application forms it completed with Mr 
P. It seems that it asked about his living arrangements, income and expenditure. For some 
of the loans (for example loan 11) STF has recorded that it saw a copy of Mr Ps wage 
slip. And it wouldve seen, based on what Mr P declared that he would most likely have been 
able to afford the loan repayments that he was committing to making. 
But as Ive explained above, that is only part of what STF needed to do. The loan being 
pounds and pence affordable is only part of the consideration. So, I havent felt he need to 
recreate individual, proportionate affordability checks for these loans because I didnt 
consider it necessary to do so. 
So, in addition to assessing the circumstances behind each individual loan provided to 
Mr P, STF also needed to consider the overall pattern of lending and what unfolded during 
the course of its lending relationship with Mr P. Having looked at the overall pattern of STFs 
lending history with Mr P, I agree with our adjudicator that STF should reasonably have seen 
that further lending was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful, at the time it provided loan 6. I 
say this because;
At this point STF ought to have realised Mr P was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr P had taken out 6 loans in around 15 months and he had been 
indebted to STF for the entire time. So STF ought to have realised it was more likely 
than not Mr P was having to borrow further to cover an ongoing need and that Mr Ps 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably and his underlying financial situation 
didnt seem to be improving. 
By loan 6, and around 15 months into the lending relationship, Mr Ps weekly 
repayments wouldve increased significantly since his first loan. He started with a 
loan for £500 and loan 6 was the largest to date at £650. So, Mr Ps repayments 
were increasing which suggests that the loans werent sustainable for him and his 
borrowing hadnt significantly decrease over the lending relationship.  
Mr P frequently took new loans on the same day as previous loans were repaid, and 
at times he had more than one loan running at the same time. STF ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mr P, on these occasions, was having to borrow 
further to effectively cover a long-term financial need. To me, this is indicative of his 
indebtedness not being sustainable;
Mr P wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed STF. Loan 17 was taken 
out 39 months after Mr Ps first loan and it was one of the largest amounts he had 
borrowed. Mr P had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to STF 
over an extended period.
I think that Mr P lost out when STF provided loans 6 - 17 because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Ps indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit over an extended period and;
the sheer number of loans and the time spent in debt was likely to have had negative 
implications on Mr Ps ability to access mainstream credit and so kept him in the 
market for these high-cost loans.
So, overall, Im upholding the complaint about loans 6 - 17 and Ill go on to set outwhat STF should do to put things right.
Putting things right
In deciding what redress STF should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what might
have happened had it stopped lending to Mr P from loan 6 as Im satisfied it ought to have.
 
Clearly there are several possibilities, and all hypothetical answers to that question.
For example, having been declined this lending Mr P may have simply left matters there and 
not tried to obtain the funds from elsewhere  particularly as a relationship existed between 
him and STF which he may not have had with others. If this wasnt a viable option, he may 
have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, he may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if he had done that,
the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. 
From what Ive seen in this case, I dont think I can fairly conclude there was a real and 
substantial chance that a new lender would have been able to lend to Mr P in a compliant 
way at this time.
Having thought about all these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or
reasonable to conclude that Mr P would more likely than not have taken up any one of
these options. So, it wouldnt be fair to now reduce STFs liability in this case for what Im
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
STF shouldnt have given Mr P loans 6  17 If STF has sold the outstanding debts it should 
buy these back if it is able to do so and then take the following steps. If it is not able to buy 
the debt back then STF should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results outlined 
below.
A) STF should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr P towards interest, 
fees and charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) STF should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mr P 
which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr P originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) STF should remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Mr P as though they had been 
repayments of the principal. If this results in Mr P having made overpayments then 
STF should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the 
complaint is settled. STF should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B 
and move to step E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance, then the amounts calculated in A and B 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus, then this should be paid to Mr P. However, if there is still an outstanding 
balance then STF should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mr P. 
E) The overall pattern of Mr Ps borrowing for loans 6  17 means any information 
recorded about them is adverse, so STF should remove these loans entirely from Mr 
Ps credit file. STF do not have to remove loan 17 from Mr Ps credit file until it has 
been repaid, but STF should still remove any adverse information recorded about it.*HM Revenue & Customs requires STF to deduct tax from this interest. STF should
give Mr P a certificate showing how much tax STF has deducted, if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I uphold Mr Ps complaint in part.
Short Term Finance Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 November 2021.
