The complaint
Mr M says Novaloans Ltd trading as Cash4unow, irresponsibly lent to him. He says he had a 
significant amount of other short-term lending when he took these loans and so cash4unow 
should have seen this and not lent to him. 
 
What happened
This complaint is about eight loans, these were a mixture of payday and longer-term 
instalment loans. Cash4unow provided the lending to Mr M between October 2015 and April 
2018. Some of the information I have been provided about the lending is in the table below.

There was a significant break in the lending between loans 4 and 5.
Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ms complaint, he thought all of the loans shouldnt have been 
given. This was because the information Cash4unow had showed that Mr M had other short-
term lending when he took these loans. And so, it wasnt appropriate to lend to him. 
Cash4unow didnt respond to the adjudicators opinion and so the complaint has been 
passed to me, an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about irresponsible lending  including all 
of the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice  on our website. Broadly 
speaking, this all means that Cash4unow needed to take reasonable steps to ensure it didnt 
lend irresponsibly. In practice, this means it should have carried out proportionate checks to 
make sure Mr M could repay their loans in a sustainable manner. Additionally, there may 
come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly demonstrates that 
the lending was unsustainable.
Applying this to the circumstances of this particular complaint, I have reached the same 
outcome as our adjudicator, for essentially the same reasons.
As our adjudicator said that the information that Cash4unow obtained at the time of sale 
showed that Mr M did already have significant other short-term lending when it approved 
these loans. For example, before loan 1 Cash4unows credit checks showed that Mr M had 
five other short-term loans to repay with a balance of over £1,600, This is almost all of his 
recorded income of £1,800. And before loan 5 it showed he still had four other loans to repay 
with a balance of £670.  
The checks also showed he had two active county court judgements over the first part of the 
lending. This fell to 1 active county court judgement at loan 3. But all of these are strong 
indications that Mr M was struggling with his finances. 
Even without looking much further into Mr Ms circumstances, I think its reasonable to say 
that the information Cash4unow had showed that Mr M would struggle to repay these loans 
sustainably, especially early on, and so Cash4unow shouldnt have lent to him.
 
Putting things right
In deciding what redress Cash4unow should fairly pay in this case Ive thought about what 
might have happened had it not lent to Mr M. 
Clearly there are a great many possible, and all hypothetical, answers to that question. 
For example, having been declined this lending Mr M may have simply left matters there, not 
attempting to obtain the funds from another lender. If this wasnt a viable option, he may 
have looked to borrow the funds from a friend or relative  assuming that was even possible.
Or, they may have decided to approach a third-party lender with the same application, or 
indeed a different application (i.e. for more or less borrowing). But even if they had done 
that, the information that would have been available to such a lender and how they would (or 
ought to have) treated an application which may or may not have been the same is 
impossible to now accurately reconstruct. From what Ive seen in this case, I certainly dont 
think I can fairly conclude there was a real and substantial chance that a new lender would 
have been able to lend to Mr M in a compliant way at this time.
Having thought about all of these possibilities, Im not persuaded it would be fair or 
reasonable to conclude that Mr M would more likely than not have taken up any one of these 
options. So it wouldnt be fair to now reduce Cash4unows liability in this case for what Im 
satisfied it has done wrong and should put right.
Cash4unow shouldnt have given Mr M loans 1 to 8.
A) Cash4unow should add together the total of the repayments made by Mr M towards 
interest, fees and charges on these loans, including payments made to a third party where 
applicable, but not including anything it has already refunded.
B) Cash4unow should calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by 
Mr M which were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mr M originally made 
the payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Cash4unow should pay Mr M the total of A plus B.D) Cash4unow should remove any adverse information it has recorded on Mr Ms credit file 
in relation to loans 1 to 8. 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Cash4unow to deduct tax from this interest. Cash4unow 
should give Mr M a certificate showing how much tax Cash4unow has deducted, if he asks 
for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Mr Ms complaint. 
Novaloans Ltd should put things right as set out above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 June 2021.
