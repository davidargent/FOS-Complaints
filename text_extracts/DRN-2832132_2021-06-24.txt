The complaint
Mr C complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) blocked his account. 
What happened
Mr C sold an item online and was due to receive the money via PayPal. He couldnt 
withdraw the money as PayPal restricted his account for 180 days from 23 February 2021. 
Mr C complained. He said hed sold the item and had provided the tracking number which 
showed it had been delivered  so he was entitled to the money. The balance was £473.09. 
He now had to wait for the money until August 2021  which he couldnt afford to do.
PayPal said their User Agreement gave them the right to withhold the money. They could 
decide if they wanted to stop dealing with a customer. And  they dont have to give a 
reason why theyve decided to do that.
Mr C brought his complaint to us. Our investigator said she could understand Mr Cs 
frustration  as PayPal hadnt explained to him why his account had been blocked. But  
PayPal could take this action if they wished, as it was contained within their User 
Agreement.
Mr C asked that an ombudsman look at his complaint.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked at what happened and can appreciate that Mr C is frustrated. He sold an item 
online in good faith and says he proved to PayPal that it was delivered  using the tracking 
number from the delivery company. But PayPal then suspended his account, so he cant get 
the money (£473.09) until August 2021.
But  Ive looked at PayPals User agreement and its clear  they can stop doing business 
with a customer if they wish, and dont have to give a reason for that. It says:
If we believe that you've engaged in any of these activities, we may take a number of 
actions to protect PayPal, its customers and others at any time in our sole discretion. The 
actions we may take include, but are not limited to, the following:
Block your PayPal account and/or hold any funds in the reserve account (including, without 
limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by PayPal, where PayPal's rights arise from 
your engagement in the restricted activity). We have no obligation to disclose the details of 
our risk management or security procedures to you.
PayPal list the restricted activities as including (I summarise  and this list is not 
exhaustive): breach the User Agreement; violate any law; infringe copyright; sell counterfeit 
goods; provide false, inaccurate or misleading information; send or receive fraudulent or 
unauthorised funds; attempt to double dip during a dispute by attempting to receive funds 
from PayPal and the seller; conduct business in a manner that leads to complaints or 
requests by buyers to invalidate payments made. 
In Mr Cs case, PayPal have made a commercial decision to stop doing business with him. 
He may feel thats unjust, but in all honesty  we cant interfere with PayPals commercial 
decision-making process  thats up to them. Theyve decided to end the business 
relationship with Mr C and what theyve done is in line with their User Agreement. So  on 
that basis, I cant say theyve done anything wrong.
So  while I appreciate that Mr C will be disappointed by my decision, I wont be asking 
PayPal to do anymore here.
My final decision
I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 July 2021.
