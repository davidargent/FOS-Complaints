K820x#14complaint
Mr G brought the complaint on behalf  of a limited  company which  Ill call H. Mr G says 
Lloyds Bank  PLC has not properly compensated H for the mis-sale of a payment protection 
insurance (PPI) policy, attached to a business  loan in 2005.
In particular Mr G says the PPI policy caused H to go into special  measures and Mr G thinks 
the company should be compensated for consequential losses it incurred  as a result.
background
In 2005 H took out a commercial loan for £123,907.86. Lloyds charged an arrangement fee 
of £1,250 which was added to the loan. At the same time H was sold a PPI policy.  The 
premium for the policy was £13,342.14 which was added to the loan and attracted interest. 
So in total H borrowed  £138,500 which was to be repaid over 10 years.
In 2014 H was experiencing some financial difficulty and Lloyds put H into special 
measures. I understand that involved,  amongst other things, reducing  Hs overdraft  limit and 
requiring additional security.  
In 2016 H complained to Lloyds about the sale of the PPI. Lloyds agreed  the PPI had been 
mis-sold. 
Lloyds paid H a total of £26,270.76. This was made up of:
£13,342.14 which was a refund of the PPI premium  added to the loan.
£3,571.97 which was the additional interest  H had paid on the loan because  of the PPI.
£1,090.69 which was for other indirect  losses related to the sale of the PPI.
£8,271.90 which was compensatory interest for the time H had not had use of the money.
Mr G didnt think Lloyds had properly  compensated H. He says H wouldnt have experienced 
the financial difficulty it did in 2014  but for the PPI. So it wouldnt have entered  special 
measures. Mr G, on behalf  of H, asked us to step in.
An adjudicator from this service thought Lloyds had fairly  compensated H and had calculated  
the compensation in line with this services  guidelines.  Mr G didnt agree and asked for an 
ombudsman to review  the complaint.
In the meantime Lloyds paid Mr G £100.00 for the inconvenience hed experienced due to 
delays in responding to correspondence he sent.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  the sale of PPI on our website and Ive taken this into account in deciding 
this case. 
Ref: DRN07466742When a PPI policy has been mis-sold Id expect the business to put the consumer, in this 
case H, in the position  theyd be in if the PPI hadnt been sold. I think Lloyds has done this 
and has made a fair offer. Ill explain  why.
H borrowed extra to pay for the PPI in 2005,  so its loan was bigger than it shouldve been.    
H paid more than it shouldve each month and it cost it more  to repay the loan than it would 
have without PPI. So H needs to get back the extra it paid.
So, Lloyds needed to:
Work out and pay H the difference between what they paid each month on the 2005 
loan and what  they wouldve paid without PPI.  
Add simple interest to the extra  amounts H paid from when they paid it until it got it 
back. The rate of interest is 8% a year.
Looking  at the calculations  provided  by Lloyds  I can see that its carried  out the above  
calculations.
Lloyds  refunded  £16,914.11,  which  represented  the PPI premium  and the extra  interest  H paid 
because  the PPI was added  to the loan.
Because  of the type of loan H took out there  were  fees paid to the Department  of Trade  and 
Industry  (DTI).  These  fees varied  according  to the size of the loan.  And because  the PPI 
premium  was added  to the loan it meant  H paid slightly  higher  fees.  I can see Lloyds  refunded  
the extra  that H paid because  of the higher  DTI fees caused  by the PPI. This amount  was 
£1,090.69  and was referred  to in Lloyds  offer as other  indirect  losses.
Lloyds  has also calculated  and paid compensatory  interest  of £8,271.90  on the above  amounts.  
This is to compensate  H for the time its not had use of the money.  The rate of interest  its used  
is 8% simple.
So I think Lloyds has refunded H everything  extra it paid due to the PPI being added  to the 
2005 loan. And its also added  compensatory  interest at 8% simple for the time its been out 
of pocket. Thats what Id expect Lloyds to do and I think  thats  fair.
Mr G told us Lloyds should  pay additional compensation because H entered into special 
measures in 2014 which he believes wouldnt have happened but for the PPI.
Ive thought about this, but for me to make an additional award  Id have to be persuaded that 
the sale of the PPI caused H to enter special measures. And that without it the business 
wouldnt have experienced the financial difficulties it did leading  up to 2014.  
Mr G has said that at the time H was put into special  measures it was short of funds of 
between £3,000 and £5,000. Mr G has said that if the PPI had not been added in 2005 then 
H wouldve had around £10,000 extra funds in 2014.
But HSBC  has sent us details of Hs accounts and contact records  with Lloyds and I can see 
from these that H was experiencing cash flow issues for some time before it entered special  
measures. 
Ref: DRN07466743If the PPI had not been added then it wouldve  meant that Hs monthly  loan repayments  
wouldve been around £140 less each month  from 2005. But I think its unlikely that H 
wouldve set that £140 aside each  month  so that it wouldve been available  to it in 2014.  And 
I dont think an extra £140 per month wouldve  prevented  H from experiencing the financial 
difficulties it did in 2013 and 2014. I think its more likely that the same events which  caused  
H to experience financial difficulties wouldve occurred whether the loan was sold with or 
without PPI. So I dont  think it was the PPI which caused H to enter  into special measures, 
and I wont direct Lloyds to make any additional  payment for this.
I see there was some  delay in dealing with Hs complaint, and responding to Mr Gs 
correspondence and Lloyds has offered Mr G £100  to compensate him for this and I think  
thats fair.
my final decision
My final decision is that Lloyds Bank PLCs offer of compensation is fair and I make no 
further award.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G on behalf of 
H to accept or reject my decision before 4 March 2019.
