The complaint
Mrs T complains about a default registered (against her) by MotoNovo Finance Limited 
(MotoNovo) with one or more third party credit reference agencies.
What happened
In November 2014 Mrs T entered into a hire purchase agreement (agreement) with 
MotoNovo for a used car costing £10,213.20. Under the terms of the agreement, everything 
else being equal, Mrs T undertook to make 59 monthly payments of £242.39 followed by one 
monthly payment of £441.39, making a total repayable of £14,742.40 at an APR of 16.4%.
Between December 2014 and February 2017 Mrs T made 27 monthly payments of £242.39 
(as required under the agreement) totalling £6,544.53.
On 14 February 2017 Mrs T requested the early termination of the agreement. In 
February 2017 Mrs T was entitled, under the terms of the agreement, to early terminate on 
payment to MotoNovo of £7,371.20 less £6,544.53 plus any damage charges.
On 1 March 2017 MotoNovo sent Mrs T a letter to say she was required to pay it £826.67 
(£7,371.20 less £6,544.53) plus a further sum for damages yet to be determined. 
On 23 March 2017 MotoNovo sent Mrs T a letter to say she was required to pay it £1,016.67 
(£826.67 plus £190 for damages).
This letter also said:
failure to make the payment within 30 days of the date of this letter will result in your 
Agreement being noted as terminated, and could affect your ability to obtain
finance in the future...
In April 2017 MotoNovo registered the agreement as voluntary terminated with one or more 
third party credit reference agencies.
Between June 2017 and July 2020 Mrs T made 37 payments (of various amounts) to clear 
(in full) the sum of £1,016.67 she owed MotoNovo following her decision, in February 2017, 
to early terminate the agreement.
In late-2021/early-2022  MotoNovo registered the agreement as being in default, backdated 
to 23 March 2017, with one or more third party credit reference agencies.
In January 2022 and having realised the agreement had been registered as being in default 
with one or more third party credit reference agencies Mrs T complained to MotoNovo. 
In February 2022 MotoNovo sent Mrs T a letter to say that it was sorry for the delay in 
registering the agreement as being in default with one or more third party credit reference 
agencies, but it had done nothing wrong in doing so.
In March 2022 and unhappy with MotoNovos response to her complaint, Mrs T referred 
matters to our service.
Mrs Ts complaint was considered by one of our investigators. He came to the view that 
MotoNovo should remove the default registered with one or more third party credit reference 
agencies (against Mrs T) and pay her £200 in compensation.
Mrs T accepted the investigators view but MotoNovo didnt. MotoNovo said it had done 
nothing wrong (and in fact Mrs T had benefited by its delay in registering the agreement as 
being in default with one or more third party credit reference agencies), but it was prepared 
to pay her £100 in compensation.
The investigator considered MotoNovos response to his view but wasnt persuaded to 
change his mind. Therefore, Mrs Ts complaint has been passed to me for review and 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
The investigator concluded that MotoNovo had no right to register the agreement as being in 
default with one or more third party credit reference agencies because it hadnt met one or 
more of its obligations under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in respect of Default notices. 
MotoNovo disagreed. It said that its letter of 23 March 2017 was sufficient for it to be able to 
register the agreement as being in default with one or more third party credit reference 
agencies.
MotoNovo might be right in what it said in its response to the investigators view, but I need 
to make no finding on this particular point. 
As MotoNovo will be well aware, when considering whats fair and reasonable, Im required 
to take into account relevant law and regulations, relevant regulatory rules, guidance and 
standards and codes of practice and, where appropriate, what I consider to have been good 
industry practice at the relevant time. This means, amongst other things, that I can come to a 
different outcome to the one a court might reach when presented with the same facts.
In my view, given
how long it took MotoNovo to decide to register the agreement in default with one or 
more third party credit reference agencies
the Information Commissioners Office guidance on how quickly defaults should be 
registered
Mrs T met all her payment obligations under the agreement prior to early terminating 
itMrs T ultimately repaid the sum recorded by MotoNovo as being due and owing to it 
before (at least as I understand it) it registered the agreement as being in default with 
one or more third party credit reference agencies
her consistent, and in my view plausible and persuasive, submission that had 
MotoNovo made it clearer to her in March 2017 that non-payment, within 30 days, of 
the sum of £1,016.67 would, or could, result in a default being registered against her 
with one or more third party credit reference agencies, she would have borrowed the 
money from family
Im satisfied, like the investigator, that in the particular circumstances of this case its both 
fair and reasonable for MotoNovo to have to remove the default (registered with one or more 
third party credit reference agencies against Mrs T in respect of the agreement). And for the 
distress and inconvenience its late registration has clearly caused Mrs T it pay her £200.
My final decision
My final decision is that MotoNovo Finance Limited must:
remove the default (registered with one or more third party credit reference agencies 
against Mrs T in respect of the agreement)
Pay Mrs T £200 for the distress and inconvenience its late registration has caused 
her
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs T to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 September 2022.
