The complaint
Mr A complains about the way that some replacement windows, that he paid for using a 
fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank Limited, were sold to him. Hes being 
represented in his complaint by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mr A used a fixed sum loan agreement with Shawbrook Bank that he electronically signed in 
November 2018 to pay for some replacement windows. The loan was for £4,428 which he 
agreed to repay by 120 monthly instalments of £80.64. He also signed the suppliers 
purchase order.
Mr As representative complained to Shawbrook Bank in October 2019 about the way that 
the replacement windows and the loan agreement were sold to Mr A. Shawbrook Bank set 
out in detail its reasons for rejecting his complaint but Mr A wasnt satisfied with its response 
so complained to this service.
Our investigator didnt recommend that his complaint should be upheld. She considered 
Shawbrook Banks response to Mr As claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 
1974. She didnt agree that Shawbrook Bank had acted unfairly. Nor did she agree that 
Shawbrook Bank should rescind the agreement or refund the repayments that Mr A had 
made. 
Mr As representative, on his behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. His representative says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
the supplier wasnt unauthorised to be a credit broker and the loan agreement shows 
the credit intermediary as being a company that was related to the supplier but had 
stopped trading;
the related company was taken to court in June 2016, and convicted in June 2017, of 
using high-pressure sales tactics but continued to use banned sales practices and 
Shawbrook Bank would have been aware of that;
Mr A was given incorrect information by the supplier and if hed been given the 
correct information he wouldnt have agreed to buy the replacement windows and he 
hasnt been allowed a proper choice;
the documentation used by Shawbrook Bank breaches section 61(1) of the 
Consumer Credit Act because its not accurate or in line with the sales contract 
signed by Mr A; and
Mr A was told by the supplier that hed qualify for a cashback card which would 
provide some money towards the payment of the loan but hes used the card and not 
received any cashback.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr A used credit provider by Shawbrook Bank to pay for the replacement windows 
and, in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim 
against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr As complaint about Shawbrook Bank, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier of the 
replacement windows and that Shawbrook Banks response to his claim under 
section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im not determining the outcome of Mr As 
claim under section 75 as only a court would be able to do that;
Mr A signed the suppliers purchase order form which showed a contract price of 
£5,576 for some replacement windows, an account subsidy of £1,148 reduced the 
account option price to £4,428, and the account option had been selected on the 
form;
Mr A also signed a feature home agreement and subsidy analysis in which he agreed 
to participate in a feature home promotion and it set out a two year fixed cost of the 
replacement windows and a total marketing subsidy which reduced the price  the 
figures in that agreement dont show a final price of £4,428 but I consider it to be 
clear from the order form and the loan agreement that a price of £4,428 was agreed 
for the replacement windows;
Mr A electronically signed the fixed sum loan agreement in November 2018 and it set 
out the total price of the replacement windows, and the amount of credit, as £4,428 - 
and the other required information including the interest rate, the total amount 
payable and the number and the amount of the monthly repayments was also shown;
the loan agreement said that the credit intermediary was a company that had 
stopped trading and which was related to the supplier  that was clearly incorrect but 
the supplier was correctly identified on the order form and was using a trading style 
that used part of the name of the related company;
Mr As representative has provided a report about some legal proceedings against 
the related company in which it was convicted of using high-pressure sales tactics  
but it hasnt provided a copy of the court judgment so Ive not been able to fully 
consider those proceedings  but those legal proceedings are about the related 
company and not the supplier and they arent enough to show that the supplier used 
those high-pressure sales tactics when selling the replacement windows to Mr A;
I consider that Mr A would have known, or ought reasonably to have known, that the 
supplier was the company identified on the order form and that loan was being 
provided to him by Shawbrook Bank  even though the credit intermediary was 
incorrectly shown on the loan agreement - and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that he was induced into making the order, or entering into the loan 
agreement, by a misrepresentation about the identity of the supplier;
Mr As representative says that the loan agreement isnt accurate so doesnt comply 
with section 61(1) of the Consumer Credit Act  but Mr A had agreed to pay £4,428 
for the replacement windows, which was the amount of credit provided to him under 
the loan agreement, and Im not persuaded that the error about the credit 
intermediary would be enough to cause the loan agreement not to comply with 
section 61(1) or not to have been properly executed (but that would be for a court to 
decide); the replacement windows were installed so Mr A received the windows that hed 
agreed to pay for  and he says that he doesnt have any problem with the 
replacement windows and is still advertising for the supplier with its poster in his 
window - but hes complained about the sales tactics that were used by the supplier;
Mr A agreed to pay £4,428 for the replacement windows as described on the 
purchase order, which included the subsidies that were shown on the order form and 
the feature home agreement, and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that the supplier misrepresented the windows or the loan agreement to Mr A at 
that time or that the supplier used sales tactics for which Shawbrook Bank would 
have any liability under section 75;
the order form said that the supplier would accept a cancellation of the contract if it 
received notice in writing within 7 days and the loan agreement said that Mr A could 
withdraw from the loan agreement within 14 days  but Ive seen no evidence to 
show that Mr A tried to cancel the order or withdraw from the loan within those 
periods  and I consider that it would be reasonable to except him to have tried to do 
so if he was concerned about the way that the replacement windows had been sold 
to him;
Mr A says that he was told by the supplier that hed qualify for a cashback card which 
would provide some money towards the payment of the loan but hes used the card 
and not received any cashback and the card provider says that it wasnt working with 
the supplier at that time;
Shawbrook Bank says that theres no evidence of the cashback card being included 
in the paperwork but I consider it to be more likely than not that Mr A was given some 
information about the cashback card by the supplier  though theres no 
documentary evidence to show what that information was;
I acknowledge the attraction for Mr A of receiving some cashback but I dont consider 
it to be likely that he was induced into making the order, or entering into the loan 
agreement, as a result of the information that he was given about the cashback card 
and I consider it to be more likely than not that hed have made the order and entered 
into the loan agreement even if the cashback card hadnt been mentioned;
Mr A has also made a complaint about the way that a conservatory was sold to him  
and that complaint is being dealt with separately  but if he wasnt happy with the 
way that the replacement windows had been sold to him I consider it to be unlikely 
that hed have then ordered a conservatory from the supplier about five weeks later;
we offer an informal dispute resolution service and try to resolve complaints by 
customers about financial businesses by looking at what we consider to be fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances  Mr As representative has made many detailed 
points in support of Mr As complaint  Ive considered all of those points but if I 
havent specifically referred to one of those points its because Ive referred to the 
ones on which I consider that I need to make a finding for me to reach a decision on 
his complaint;
I sympathise with Mr A for the way that he clearly feels about his dealings with the 
supplier, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres 
been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the supplier; and
I consider that Shawbrook Banks response to his section 75 claim was fair and 
reasonable in these circumstances and I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable for 
me to require it to end the loan agreement, to refund to Mr A any of his monthly 
payments, to pay him any compensation or to take any other action in response to 
his complaint.My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr As complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 March 2022.
