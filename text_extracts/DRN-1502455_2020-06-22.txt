The complaint
Mr R complains that loans he had from Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as 
Sunny) were unaffordable.
What happened
Mr R had five loans from Sunny between July 2017 and September 2017 as follows:
Loan Date Amount Term Max Monthly 
Repayment*Due Repaid
1 30 Jul 2017 £250 24w £94.45 12 Jan 2018 01 Nov 2017
2 18 Aug 2017 £300 24w £209.55 2 Feb 2018 08 Dec 2017
3 26 Aug 2017 £200 24w £285.70 9 Feb 2018 24 Nov 2017
4 02 Sep 2017 £100 24w £316.14 16 Feb 2018 22 Sep 2017
5 29 Sep 2017 £200 24w £320.36 6 Apr 2018 26 Mar 2018
* Including overlapping loans
Mr R says Sunny didnt carry out proper affordability checks and he couldnt make the 
repayments whilst meeting his other financial obligations. He says he was using multiple 
short-term lenders and this led to him being in a cycle of lending, worsening his financial 
situation and meaning he was unable to pay essential bills.
Sunny says it asked Mr R about income and expenditure and checked his credit file. It says 
it was satisfied its checks showed the loans were affordable based upon the information.
Our adjudicator recommended the complaint should be upheld in part. He found that, by loan 
3, proportionate checks were likely to have shown Mr R was having problems managing his 
money as he had multiple short-term loans at the same time. Our adjudicator recommended 
Sunny should refund interest and charges on loans 3 to 5 (plus 8% statutory interest) and 
remove any associated adverse information from Mr Rs credit file.
Sunny responded to say that it was unclear what proportionate check was expected, but that 
it asked Mr R about expenses including short-term loans. It says his disposable income 
showed the repayments, including on other loans, were affordable. It adds that Mr R was 
charged interest for under a year and his repayments were a small proportion of his income.
DRN-1502455What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Sunny was required to lend responsibly. It should have 
made checks to make sure Mr R could afford to repay the loans before it lent to him. Those 
checks needed to be proportionate to things such as the amount Mr R was borrowing, and 
his lending history. But there was no set list of checks Sunny had to do.
Loans 1 and 2
Im satisfied Sunny did enough checks when it assessed loans 1 and 2 and there was 
nothing in the available information to indicate the repayments were unaffordable.
Loans 3 to 5
By loan 3, Mr Rs maximum monthly repayment was a large proportion of his declared 
income of £1,083.33. I consider this alone indicated there was a significant risk that Mr R 
wouldnt have been able to meet his existing commitments without having to borrow again. 
But I also consider this should have prompted Sunny to carry out better checks. I think a 
proportionate check should have included a full financial review at this stage because:
This was Mr Rs third loan application within a month;
His scheduled repayment was a significant proportion of his income;
Loans 1 and 2 were still outstanding and the loan terms were all almost six months.
Such a review is likely to have found Mr R had at least one other loan with another short-
term loan company. This loan continued to be outstanding when Mr R applied for loans 4 
and 5 and, as his scheduled repayment also continued to increase, I think its unlikely Mr R 
would have been able to sustainably meet his monthly repayments for loans 3, 4 or 5. So Im 
satisfied it was irresponsible for Sunny to have approved Mr Rs last three loans.
My final decision
My decision is that Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) should:
Refund all interest and charges that Mr R paid on loans 3 to 5;
Pay interest of 8% simple a year on refunds from payment date to settlement date*;
Remove any negative information about loans 3 to 5 from Mr Rs credit file.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give
Mr R a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 July 2020.
