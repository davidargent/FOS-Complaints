The complaint
Mr H complains that Capital One (Europe) plc wont refund to him the money that he paid for 
some flights.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr H used his Capital One credit card in May 2019 to pay £931.96 to a holiday 
company for some flights for a holiday in September 2019 for himself and another 
person;
when he was on holiday the holiday company stopped trading and his flight home 
was cancelled  the Civil Aviation Authority arranged a flight home the day after the 
cancelled flight but it was to a different airport and a coach was provided to take him 
back to his departure airport;
he says that the holiday was ruined and he didnt get the flights that he paid for so he 
claimed a refund from Capital One under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 
of the additional costs that hed incurred of £172.09 and the £931.96 that hed paid 
for the flights;
Capital One credited £172.09 for the additional costs to Mr Hs account in November 
2019 but didnt agree to refund the money that hed paid for the flights;
Mr H complained to this service and our investigator agreed that there had been a 
breach of contract as the return flight wasnt provided to him  but she said that the 
contract had been fulfilled by the Civil Aviation Authority providing the return flight so 
there had been no financial loss for Mr H and he'd been put back in the position that 
he would have been in  so she didnt think that Capital One had treated him unfairly;
Mr H has asked for his complaint to be considered by an ombudsman;
in certain circumstances, section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against 
the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the supplier;
to be able to uphold Mr Hs complaint about Capital One, I must be satisfied that 
theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the holiday company and 
that Capital Ones response to his claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  
but Im not determining the outcome of Mr Hs claim under section 75 as only a court 
would be able to do that;
I sympathise with Mr H for the difficulties that he suffered when the return flight was 
cancelled  that must have been a distressing experience for him  but he received 
the outbound flight, the holiday company then stopped trading and didnt provide him 
with the return flight that hed paid for  and I consider that to be a breach of contract 
by the holiday company;
Mr H incurred additional costs as a result of the return flight being cancelled and 
Capital One has credited £172.09 for those costs to his account;
the Civil Aviation Authority arranged a flight to bring Mr H home and, whilst its clear 
that it wasnt a like-for-like flight, I consider that it was an adequate remedy for the 
breach of contract which put Mr H in the position that he would have been in if there 
hadnt been a breach of contract;
I consider that Capital Ones response to Mr Hs claim was fair and reasonable in 
these circumstances and Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me 
to require it to take any further action to remedy the breach of contract; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Capital One to refund to Mr H all ,or any part, of the £931.96 that he paid for the 
flights, to pay him any more compensation or to take any other action in response to 
his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 3 March 2021.
