DRN-3648883
The complaint
Mr S complains that on rejection of his car  Lex Auto lease Ltd (Lex) wouldnt refund the cost 
of an accessory on it. Also, that the  rental payment refund was worked out incorrectly. He 
would like the cost of the accessory refunded and the correct rental payment refund
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties so I wont repeat them again here 
instead I will focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so I have reached the following conclusions:
Our investigator broke down the figures for the partial reimbursement of the rental 
payment that Lex worked out when it agreed to rejection of the car. Having looked at 
these figures I agree with our investigators view that they are correct.  Mr Ss doesnt 
seem to have taken issue with that part of our investigators view . It seems the 
outstanding issue is Lexs refusal to  refund of the cost of the accessory he added to 
the car. .
I have seen the letter Lex sent  Mr S when it agreed to the acceleration boost 
performance  being fitted to the vehicle. That letter makes it clear that if the 
accessory is still fitted at the end of the lease arrangement no money will be 
refunded. I do understand Mr Ss point that Lex ended the agreement when it agreed 
to rejection. However, from the information I have seen it seems Mr S paid the 
manufacturer direct for  the acceleration boost performance  not Lex. So this isnt 
part of the finance agreement for which Lex is responsible. And on that basis, I cant 
reasonably ask Lex to refund the cost of the accessory
My final decision
My final decision is that I dont upheld this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr S to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 September 2022.
