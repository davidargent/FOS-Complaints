The complaint
Mr G complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) registered a default against 
him without giving him an opportunity to repay the overdraft on his account. 
What happened
Mr G says he applied for credit but noticed a default had been registered against him. Mr G 
says he held an old account with NatWest which he later found out was overdrawn by £700. 
Mr G says he paid this off, but NatWest had already registered the default. He says they 
didnt give him an opportunity to repay the overdraft and queries why, if the debt collectors 
were able to contact him on his mobile phone, NatWest couldnt have attempted to contact 
him using the same method. Mr G complained about NatWests decision to transfer his 
account to Recoveries as he claimed he had contacted NatWest to close his account. 
NatWest responded and explained Mr Gs account was last used in 2019 at which point the 
overdraft reached £754.39. NatWest said, in line with the terms and conditions, the account 
then accrued interest and charges and, following a payment by Mr G, this brought his 
account balance to £308.20 in overdraft. NatWest said Mr Gs account wasnt brought down 
to a zero balance for it to be closed. NatWest explained theyd written to Mr G a number of 
times and also tried to call him, but as they didnt receive a response his account was 
transferred to Recoveries. NatWest said they understand Mr G claims the address they have 
is one of the properties he has on rent and that he says he asked for this address to be 
changed when he asked for the account to be closed. NatWest said they were unable to 
locate any notes relating to the request for the address change or the account closure.   
Our investigator looked into things for Mr G. He thought NatWest hadnt acted unfairly in 
registering a default. Mr G disagreed so the matter has come to me for a decision.  
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided not to uphold the complaint. I understand Mr G will be 
disappointed by this but Ill explain why I have made this decision. 
The issue here appears to have arisen out of NatWests actions following Mr Gs account 
being dormant. NatWest say they applied their dormancy policy as no payments had been 
made into Mr Gs account for between 42 and 179 days. 
Ive looked at Mr Gs bank account statements and this shows a payment being made in 
August 2019 and no further credits into his account until August 2020. It was between this 
period that NatWest started writing to Mr G asking him to make a payment into his account. 
The information Ive seen shows the dormancy was broken following the credit in August 
2020 but then restarted in February 2021 following no further payments being made into the 
account. So, I dont think it was unreasonable for NatWest to follow their dormancy policy 
here. 
I note Mr G says NatWest didnt give him an opportunity to repay the overdraft. NatWest 
have provided copy letters which are auto-generated by their system. They have provided 
system information which shows a letter was sent in February 2020 to say Mr G hasnt paid 
any money into his account recently and its important he uses the account regularly as he 
has an overdraft facility. The letter asks Mr G to make a payment. Theres a further letter 
sent a month later saying NatWest have been trying to contact Mr G and no funds have 
been paid into his account. The letter explains, if NatWest dont hear from Mr G then they 
might end the overdraft arrangement and ask Mr G to pay back the money owed. A further 
letter says if Mr G doesnt get in touch, NatWest may issue an Overdraft Termination Notice 
asking him to repay the total amount owed together with interest and charges. The letter 
says, if NatWest issue a notice they may also register Mr Gs details with the credit reference 
agencies (CRAs). The letter explains, this might make it difficult for Mr G to borrow money 
or get credit in the future. Further letters in April and July give the same information.    
 
This process is restarted following the dormancy break and, as no further payments are 
made, NatWest issue a letter headed Formal notice of intention to file a default and to take 
action to recover debt  this is sent to Mr G together with a Notice of Default. This letter 
gives Mr G 28 days to make payment or arrangements to pay otherwise NatWest will take 
steps to report the debt to the CRAs. NatWest say they will also transfer the account to 
Recoveries. The default is then reported to the CRAs following no further payment. 
Taking this all into account, I cant say NatWest have acted unreasonably here. The 
information shows they sent a number of letters asking Mr G to make a payment and also 
letting him know what steps they would take should they not hear back from him. I 
acknowledge Mr G says he was no longer living at the address these letters were sent to 
and that he had asked NatWest to change his address details. But, NatWest say they dont 
have any record of Mr G making this request and I havent seen any evidence which shows 
Mr G did. The terms and conditions of Mr Gs account says, if a customers contact details 
change, they should let NatWest know as soon as possible. So, on this basis, NatWest were 
writing to the address they had on record for Mr G but wont have known this property was 
being rented out and he was living at a different address  so I cant say NatWest have 
made an error. Ive also seen no evidence that Mr G asked for his account to be closed.  
I understand Mr G feels NatWest should also have tried to call him on his mobile. NatWest 
have provided system notes which show they made a number of attempts to call Mr G 
between March to April 2021, but they didnt receive a response. Theyve provided details of 
the three phone numbers they hold for Mr G, this includes his mobile  and the mobile 
number theyve given matches the number Mr G has provided our service. NatWest say their 
automatic dialler system attempted to contact Mr G using all three numbers. So, I think 
NatWest have acted reasonably in attempting to contact Mr G by letter and phone and, given 
they didnt receive a response, I cant say theyve acted unfairly in reporting a default. 
My final decision
For the reasons I have given, it is my final decision that the complaint is not upheld. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 August 2022.
