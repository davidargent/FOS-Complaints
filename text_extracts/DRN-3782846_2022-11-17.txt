The complaint
This complaint is about National Westminster Bank Plcs (NatWests) decision to reject 
Mr and Mrs Rs application to remortgage.
What happened
Mr and Mrs R applied for a NatWest mortgage online on 15 May 2022. At the time, they had 
two mortgages and a second charge with third-party lenders that they wanted to bring 
together. They also wanted some additional borrowing for home improvements. 
Mr and Mrs R say the agreement in principle went through, but on 6 June 2022, they 
received a call from an underwriter who said NatWest couldnt agree to the mortgage 
because it was considered debt consolidation. Mr and Mrs R queried this and were advised 
there were other commitments on their credit file which also affected NatWests decision. 
Mr and Mrs R say they told the underwriter they have a loan with a third-party lender, but 
that it would be paid off in 16 months. The underwriter reiterated the lending was considered 
debt consolidation and that the application would not be agreed. The underwriter then 
recommended Mr and Mrs R speak to a mortgage adviser.
Mr and Mrs R say they spoke to a NatWest mortgage adviser who initially queried why they 
didnt submit the application online. After a discussion about it, the adviser didnt think their 
application should be treated as debt consolidation. Nevertheless, the adviser went ahead 
and submitted a new application on their behalf. NatWest considered Mr and Mrs Rs second 
application but declined it again. Mr and Mrs R say they spoke to at least one other NatWest 
mortgage adviser, who also queried why they hadnt submitted their application online and 
didnt agree that there was any debt consolidation.
Mr and Mrs R say they were told the second application probably wasnt accepted because 
of the hard search completed by NatWest four weeks earlier. Mr and Mrs R say they were 
advised to wait six months before applying again. They feel theyve been disadvantaged by 
incorrect advice they received from NatWest.
NatWest investigated Mr and Mrs Rs complaint and said that under its lending criteria, 
Mr and Mrs R were considered to be consolidating their debt and that it couldnt offer a 
mortgage on this basis. But, it said, the underwriter was incorrect to recommend Mr and 
Mrs R seek a mortgage adviser, because the mortgage had already been declined due to 
affordability issues in addition to the debt consolidation issue. 
NatWest felt the underwriter making this suggestion led to Mr and Mrs R submitting a 
second application that would not have been accepted. To resolve this, NatWest arranged to 
remove the hard searches recorded on Mr and Mrs Rs credit files during the second 
application. It also offered them £300 in compensation for any distress or inconvenience 
caused.
Mr and Mrs R didnt agree with NatWests proposed settlement. They said they were now 
stuck on a variable rate costing them more per month. They think NatWest should either 
accept the original mortgage application or cover the additional interest they will need to pay 
for at least six months, or until their credit files are cleared.
NatWest reconsidered their complaint and agreed to compensate them for additional interest 
they were paying on their mortgage for around four months, totalling £969.29. NatWest said 
this was to compensate them for any delay in applying for lending elsewhere due to the 
second hard search recorded on their credit files. They also awarded an additional £200 for 
any distress and inconvenience caused when the business representative who was 
investigating their complaint didnt get back to them when they said they would.
Our investigator looked into Mr and Mrs Rs concerns, but they didnt think NatWest needed 
to do anything more to resolve the complaint. As Mr and Mrs R disagreed, the complaint was 
passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont think Mr and Mrs Rs complaint should be upheld, and Ill explain 
why.
Firstly, Id like to explain that the ombudsman service offers an informal dispute resolution 
service. While we take relevant law, regulation and good practice into account, we cant 
force a business to offer lending if it doesnt want to. 
NatWest considered Mr and Mrs Rs application against its lending criteria and decided not 
to agree to the mortgage. I appreciate Mr and Mrs R dont agree with NatWests decision, 
but NatWest is expected to properly assess its customers financial circumstances before 
agreeing to lending, particularly on something as significant and substantial as a mortgage 
against their home. NatWest explained its reasons for declining the application and I couldnt 
ask it to do any more than that.
NatWest has accepted that the underwriter shouldnt have told Mr and Mrs R to apply for the 
mortgage through an adviser, so I dont need to reach a finding on whether that should have 
been said or not. But I have considered whether NatWest has done enough to correct any 
impact of Mr and Mrs R receiving this advice.
As a result of the advice, Mr and Mrs R approached a NatWest mortgage adviser to discuss 
resubmitting their application. This resulted in a second application being submitted. From 
what Ive seen, NatWests mortgage advisers were made aware of the reasons Mr and 
Mrs R were given for their declined application. Mr and Mrs R say both mortgage advisers 
disagreed with the decision made by the underwriter and I can see that they proceeded to 
submit a second application. Based on the information the underwriter had already provided, I think it seemed more likely 
than not the second application would also be declined. So, I think it was appropriate for 
NatWest to arrange for the second hard searches recorded against Mr and Mrs Rs credit 
files to be removed. I understand this has already been done. Mr and Mrs R also had to go 
through a second application which would probably have been both inconvenient and 
stressful. But the mortgage adviser acted on their behalf and so I think this would have 
mitigated Mr and Mrs Rs inconvenience somewhat. NatWest has offered £300 to 
compensate them and I think this is fair in the circumstances.
While it was right for NatWest to remove the second hard search from Mr and Mrs Rs credit 
file as it never should have happened, I dont think that means NatWest should remove the 
first hard search. I say this because Mr and Mrs R submitted the first application themselves 
without advice. The application was considered, and as part of that a hard search was 
completed. NatWest could not offer the mortgage requested due to what it found out during 
its enquiries. NatWest is obligated to accurately reflect that to the credit reference agencies 
it reports to. It follows, I also dont think NatWest is responsible for Mr and Mrs R having to 
pay a higher interest rate with their third-party lenders. 
I say this because it is the first hard search that is delaying them in submitting applications to 
other lenders. Mr and Mrs R would always have had a hard search on their credit file even if 
NatWest hadnt given them incorrect advice. I dont think NatWests responsible for Mr and 
Mrs R being advised to wait a while before submitting applications to other lenders as a 
result of the first hard search.
Even so, NatWest paid Mr and Mrs R £969.29 to contribute to the additional interest theyre 
paying. I dont think NatWest had to do this, as I dont think it made a mistake in completing 
the first hard search. So, I wont be asking NatWest to compensate Mr and Mrs R any further 
for that.
NatWests complaint handler apologised for not getting back to them sooner after they 
submitted information about the interest they were paying. NatWest awarded £200 in 
compensation for the distress and inconvenience that caused, on top of the interest 
contribution above, and £300 compensation that had already been paid. That means Mr and 
Mrs R have received £1,469.29 in total. This is significantly more than the ombudsman 
service would usually award in similar circumstances. So, I think NatWest has done enough 
to put things right and I dont think it needs to do anything more. 
My final decision
For the reasons explained above, I do not uphold Mr and Mrs Rs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr R and Mrs R to 
accept or reject my decision before 15 December 2022.
