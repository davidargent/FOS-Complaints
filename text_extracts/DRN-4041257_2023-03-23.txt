The complaint
Mr M complains about a missing pension from Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited (Aviva) 
about his pension.
What happened
Mr M said that in March 2021 he asked his IFA about part of his pension fund that he 
thought was missing. When the IFA chased, Aviva said it found a fund worth around £56,000 
and it gave him options for dealing with it. He was later told the rediscovered funds did not 
exist and had been subsumed in a transfer made in 2015. He asked for written proof the 
fund didnt exist and asked it was verified by in house counsel. Aviva said it was a system 
issue. He didnt accept this and he said if there was a system issue the system could equally 
be wrong about the fund being transferred out in 2015. He wanted the fund reinstated and 
added to his other pre-existing policy with Aviva.
Aviva said Mr Ms policy was transferred on 24 November 2015 and around £180,000 was 
paid out which was both parts of his policy. Unfortunately both parts of the old policy were 
not correctly updated so appeared to still be in existence and it looked as though it was still 
in force. There was around £142,000 for ordinary rights and around £38,000 for protected 
rights. It accepted that it had wrongly told Mr M that there was money in the policy. It said 
sorry and offered payment. If Mr M had suffered any financial loss he was invited to submit 
evidence.
The investigator said he had seen copy correspondence sent to Mr M and the Aviva SIPP 
team when his funds were transferred to the Aviva SIPP in 2015. The letter confirming the 
transfer quoted the old policy number and the amount transferred. The same policy number 
was quoted on the letter dated 27 July 2015. He had asked Aviva to run searches using all 
his previous addresses and screenshots of active and inactive accounts. This showed two 
policies with the same policy number ending 7419. It seemed to him that policy was 
terminated in 2015 and the full amount transferred out as set out in the letter to the Aviva 
SIPP team. It did not seem there were any other policies showing under this address. It 
seemed the letter issued in 2021 was a mistake. It was not fair or reasonable to expect Aviva 
to fund that value though he accepted Mr M had suffered a loss of expectation. There was 
no evidence he had suffered financial loss. Aviva had offered £800 which he thought was fair 
and reasonable. 
Mr M didnt agree. He said there was no explanation as to how Aviva was able to show a 
fund existed in 2021 it was also now showing online.
The investigator asked Aviva to comment. It responded that there was a system error 
because the policies were not terminated correctly which allowed the calculation to take 
place. It assured him the funds were transferred . The investigator said that if there had been 
a fund remaining after 2015 he would have expected to see some statement letters and 
alternative policy numbers but there wasnt any evidence to that effect. The 2015 letter made 
clear the transfer was in full and final settlement. Aviva had accepted the poor service but 
what remained in dispute was the existence of the fund value of around £56,000. Overall he 
had not seen any evidence that there are funds unaccounted for and that the full pension 
wasnt transferred in 2015. He was satisfied there was an error on Avivas part in 2021 in 
quoting a fund value which led to a loss of expectation. He thought the compensation fairly 
reflected that loss. He wasnt asking Aviva to do anything further.
Mr M produced a further letter dated 12 April 2021 sent to his IFA with a retirement options 
pack for policy ending 7419. This showed a value of around £53,000 for non-protected 
rights. 
He still didnt agree. He didnt see how Aviva could write in April and July 2021 quoting a 
value for a policy that did not exist. He had awful service. How could he be sure they werent 
lying to him? What evidence had we requested?. He didnt accept that two funds could have 
identical fund values. He felt the offer was a risible offer
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In order to consider this complaint I have considered the evidence available to me. I asked 
Aviva to provide further evidence that the money transferred in 2015 was actually received 
into Mr Ms new policy and not rejected and about the source of the money that was 
transferred into the policy in 1989.
For ease of reference I have set out a timeline of evidence.
Evidence timeline
12 June 1989 letter from a pension trust for a previous employer of Mr M providing him with 
a transfer value information sheet for his employment between March 1978 and February 
1989. The value is around £10,781. It also said that in addition to the transfer value around 
500 units were also held in a diversified fund of Provident Mutual Managed Fund and as of 
May 1989 these had a value of around £7,500.
November 1989 copy of an application form to add around £20,200 to an Aviva personal 
pension plan ending 7419. The name of the transferring pension scheme is listed as being 
the same as the one in the 12 June 1989 letter. The form is signed by Mr M and dated 24 
August 1989.
July 1990 confirmation of receipt of a transfer of around £20,200 into policy ending 7419 
which was invested on 17 November 1989 into the with profits fund.
21 November 2011 letter to Mr M from Aviva for plan ending 7419 telling Mr M that from 6 
April 2012 restrictions on the plan on how contracted out payments will be used are being 
removed.
27 April 2015 letter from Aviva to Mr M re policy ending 7419 quoting a current unit 
statement value of around £148,000 pre 1995 personal pension (non protected rights).  27 
April 2015 further letter from Aviva to Mr M re policy ending 7419 in respect of pre 1995 
Personal Pension (Protected rights) with a value of around £40,500.
3 August 2015 email from Mr Ms IFA re his pension transfer and the fact it is on an old 
system at Aviva so the value has to be calculated manually so it is always difficult to get an 
exact current value until it is live on the new system. It quotes a value of around £189,000.
5 November 2015 copy Origo transfer request for policy ending 7419 for a transfer to the Aviva SIPP team. The payment reference for the receiving scheme ends 2245 (this seems to 
be the account number for his pre-retirement account in the SIPP  see letter of 2/12/15)
27 November 2015 letter addressed to Aviva client services confirming that around £180,000 
was transferred from Mr Ms policy ending 7419 ( a personal pension) made up of around 
£38,000 former protected rights and around £142,000 ordinary rights. The letter says this is 
in full and final settlement. It notes an interest payment of around £122 will follow (and this is 
shown on the cash statement for the new account listed below in early December 2015  
see below).
30 November 2015 personal illustration for Mr Ms pre-retirement portfolio ending 245  
showing a transfer in of around £180,000 on 27 November 2015.
2 December 2015 letter from Aviva to Mr M confirming his pension has a pre-retirement 
value of around £180,000 held in portfolio ending 2245 (the pre-retirement portfolio number). 
It confirms his instruction to transfer this to his post retirement account (Pension Portfolio 
ending 7381) and to take 25% tax free cash of around £44,000 which it says will be paid out 
on 2 December 2015.
30 November 2015 a personal illustration for Mr M with respect to a transfer from another 
pension scheme of around £180,000 which was received on 27 November 2015
12 February 2016 copy of a final response letter from Aviva to Mr Ms IFA regarding a 
complaint about the 2015 transfer. There appears to have been a delay and calculations are 
completed to ensure there is no loss. It notes Mr M has six months to take the matter to this 
service should he wish to do so.
June 2016 portfolio valuation summary showing the post retirement portfolio ending 7381 
confirms:-
an opening value on 20 June 2015 of zero and
closing value of around £132,000 on 19 December 2015. (note this seems to reflect 
the fact that Mr M took his tax-free lumps sum of around £44,000 0n 2 December 
2015 thus reducing the remaining balance on his account).
opening value on 20 December 2015 of around £132,000 and a 
closing value on 19 June 2016 of £92,000 
showing a difference of around minus £39,000. (note this seems to match up with 
the additional lump sum of around £40,000 paid out in June 2016 as shown on the 
cash statement below)
December 2016 portfolio valuation summary for portfolio ending 7381 showing:-
an opening value of around £132,000 on 20 December 2015 and 
closing of around £92,000 on 19 June 2016 
 difference of around minus £39,000 and 
an opening value on 20 June 2016 of around £92,000 and 
a closing value on 19 December 2016 of around £105,000 a difference of around plus £12,000.
2015  2017 cash transactions  I have seen evidence of the cash movement on Mr Ms 
SIPP for this period. This shows a PCLS payment of around £44,000 made on 2 December 
2015 and an initial adviser charge of around £1,300 om the same date. Around £134,000 is 
transferred from his pre-retirement account on 2 December 2015 to post retirement account 
of around £134,000. An amount of around £112 interest is credited on 2 December 2015. 
There is a taxable lump sum withdrawal of around £40,000 in June 2016. There are also 
ongoing adviser charges shown.
March 2021  Mr M says he asked his IFA to contact Aviva as he thought he was missing 
some pension.
1 April 2021 email from Mr Ms IFA to Aviva asking if they can track down a possibly lost 
pension fund.
12 April 2021 letter from Aviva to Mr M saying thank you for getting in touch with us, and 
quoting his plan number ending 7419 and showing an estimated retirement fund of around 
£53,000 and giving retirement options.
20 April 2021 call with Mr Ms IFA and Aviva regarding policy 7419 confirming a transfer out 
is possible and there is no guaranteed minimum pension or guaranteed annuity rights. 
27 July 2021 letter from Aviva to Mr M confirms that the policy ending 7419 exists and has a 
value of around £56,000 and attaches a transfer payment release form and other papers.
20 October 2021 Final Response letter from Aviva to Mr M.
My analysis of the papers.
Based on the evidence I have seen I think it is clear that Mr Ms policy ending 7419 received 
a transfer from his former employers pension scheme. While the 1989 transfer value letter 
quotes a value in two parts the amount then confirmed to be transferred in later 1989 is 
greater than the sum of both parts (£20,200 as opposed to 10,781 plus £7,500 which is 
around £18,200) this suggests to me that the full value of both parts was transferred. 
Further the letters in late 1989 and early 1990 confirm the money was received and was 
invested in November 1989 in the with profits fund. So while the money may have originally 
been in two parts it seems it was invested in one fund. So on balance based on the evidence 
presented I think the full amount of Mr Ms old employer pension was transferred in 1989 
including the part that was held in Provident Mutual..
I do not know whether Mr M made further contributions to his policy ending 7419 in the time 
between 1989 and the subsequent transfer to his SIPP in 2015. But I note Mr M had an IFA 
at the time of the 2015 transfer. I say that because there is evidence in the form of a letter 
from 2016 that he complained about the timing of the 2015 transfer and the August 2015 
email between Mr M and his IFA discusses the current value and timing of the transfer. I 
would have expected his IFA to make sure he was happy the full amount had been 
transferred from policy 7419 to his SIPP at the time and he was happy with the value quoted. 
This is relevant in terms of ensuring that nothing remained behind when the transfer was 
done in 2015.
It would seem likely that Mr M and or his IFA would have received annual statements for 
policy 7419 and therefore have some sense of the value of the policy over the years and 
therefore whether the amount transferred seemed correct.  Mr M has not provided any evidence there was a difference between what was transferred and what he expected to 
transfer. So I dont have any evidence to suggest the amount transferred was not correct at 
the time.
The further papers from the new SIPP show the full amount was transferred, received and 
has not been returned to his old policy ending 7419 in the two years post transfer (the cash 
statement from 2015 to 2017 shows this). At one time I was concerned that the money might 
have been returned in part and this was the amount quoted in 2021. However the evidence 
presented confirms that the money was not returned in the following years. I assume that 
had a substantial chunk of money gone missing thereafter because it was returned to the old 
policy, Mr M and or his IFA would have noticed and commented. 
On the basis that the full amount of his old policy was transferred to his new SIPP the 
remaining amount should have been nil. I therefore think it is reasonable to conclude that the 
amount quoted by Aviva in 2021 as a value by reference to his old policy number is a relic as 
a result of the policy not being terminated properly.
While I cannot be 100% certain, based on the evidence that I have, on balance I think it is 
most likely that the entire fund was transferred in 2015. So I do not think that Mr M is entitled 
to the amount of around £53,000 that was quoted as remaining on his old policy in 2021. 
While I cannot be totally certain why that amount is showing I think the explanation offered 
by Aviva that it is due to not fully terminating his old policy seems reasonable to me. 
Whether or not that explanation is correct I think the full amount of his policy was transferred 
from Mr Ms old employer to his Aviva policy and in turn to his new SIPP. Therefore there 
should not be any balance remaining on the policy ending 7419.
I note also the investigator asked Aviva to do a search for policies at all his previous 
addresses. I have seen screenshots of the results of those searches. These show Mr Ms 
policy ending 7419 as terminated. The searches have been completed using Mr Ms NI 
number and address and not reveal other policies.
Mr Ms comments 
I sent copies of papers provided by Aviva to Mr M. These related to the original transfer from 
his former employers pension scheme and the subsequent transfer to his SIPP. I asked Mr 
M to comment on these. I also asked why he believed there was a missing pension policy. 
He said:-
1. That he was sorting out old papers and came across a letter from a previous 
employers pension scheme about a transfer of funds to Norwich Union. He didnt 
know how much was transferred but thought part of the money remained with 
Provident Mutual. He thought there was a dispute with the IFA at the time. He 
thought the missing pension was transferred into Aviva by one of the past mergers 
of companies into Aviva. He didnt have any policy numbers or specific amount of 
money. The only evidence he had was the letter in April and July 2021 showing he 
had a remaining value of around £56,000. He thought some of the funds in the 
policy ending 7419 originated from a previous employer but not all of them. He said 
he hadnt cashed the cheque for £200 or accepted the offer of £800 in total.
While I can understand that Mr M might have reached the conclusion he did based 
on the papers he held, I dont think this is correct. I say that because the papers I 
have set out above show the values in his former employers scheme and the 
amount transferred and invested. I concluded that these showed the full amount of both parts were transferred from his former employers for the reasons given above. 
No part remained with Provident mutual. So it does not seem that his assumption 
was correct based on the evidence set out.
2. Some of the documents were largely not relevant to his original complaint which was 
not related to the 2015 transfer. The 2015 transfer matter has now become a 
separate issue and so the complaint is now 2-pronged.
I dont agree. Aviva have said that the amount of around £53,000 was a relic from 
the transfer as the policy had not been terminated properly. So there is a direct 
connection between the two. The evidence shows that the full amount transferred 
was not returned at a later date. So this does seem to support what Aviva has said.
3.The 2015 transfer confusion was introduced by Aviva in a letter to him dated 20 
October 2021 as a means of deflecting focus from the point in hand which was 
missing funds from his former employers pension scheme. He also referred to a 
letter from Aviva on 25 November 2021 in which it said Unfortunately, we seem to 
have had a system issue and the former protected rights part of your policy wasnt 
terminated correctly, so this part of the policy looked like it was still in force." 
He argued it could equally be the case that the alleged transfer of the funds in 2015 
was an IT error and the element of this policy does in fact still exist as an additional 
fund owing to me.
I think it  is clear from the new SIPP policy documents that the money was 
transferred, received and not returned. It is possible that the value quoted was 
wrong due to legacy systems but that seems unlikely to me. I say that because the 
original money from the former employer pension scheme was in two parts but was 
all transferred into the same with profits fund. So it seems unlikely Mr Ms 
suggestion  is correct. While the fund was notionally allocated between protected 
and non-protected rights the 2015 transfer letters show both parts were transferred. 
Mr M has not produced any evidence (such as annual statements) to show that the 
amount transferred in 2015 was wrong. Further while his IFA complained about the 
transfer this was about a delay and the IFA does not seem to have disputed the 
values at the time. Had there been an insufficiency in the transfer amount I might 
reasonably have expected either Mr M or his IFA to have noticed and commented at 
the time but they didnt. Further neither of them has suggested nor provided 
evidence to show that the 2015 transfer amount was wrong,.
4. He argued that notwithstanding the transfer of the entire amount in 2015 Aviva could 
still provide valuations several years later, not once but twice. He also said his IFA 
confirmed on 20 April 2021 that the rediscovered fund was showing online. 
He didnt think anyone had properly accounted for his money which was originally 
held by his former employers pension scheme and or the Provident Mutual Fund 
which were partially introduced to Norwich Union on 17 November 1989. 
I dont agree for the reasons set out above. I think the evidence does show the full 
amount was transferred in 1989.
5. He referred to the Transfer Value Notification Sheet provided by his former 
employers scheme in their letter of 12 June 1989. He referred to  "Note 4 In addition 
to the transfer value quoted above 513.7 units are held in the Diversified Fund of the 
Provident Mutual Managed Fund. At 19-05-89 these had a value of £7516.97".I would refer Mr M to my comments above about the total transfer value being 
greater than the sum of the parts so it seems reasonable to conclude both parts were 
transferred at the time. Further I have not seen any evidence to suggest that wasnt 
the case.
6. He thought the £7516.97 is the amount he believed had not been accounted for and 
which he was led to believe by Aviva constitutes the additional amounts of 
£53,136.54 and £56,161.31 valued at 12 April 2021 and 27 July 2021 respectively. 
Either that or the £7,516.97 as it was in 1989 has not been correctly assigned to him 
from Provident Mutual and there is another policy owing to him at today's value.
He said someone needs to provide PROOF of what has happened to his funds not 
just a partial stream of documents and unsupported assertions.
For the reasons set out above, on balance, I think Aviva has provided a reasonable 
body of evidence to show that in my view on balance all of the money was 
transferred from Mr M former employers pension scheme and onwards to his SIPP. I 
think the 2021 letters suggesting an outstanding value may well have been triggered 
in response to Mr Ms enquiries in April 2021. I think the explanation provided by 
Aviva is reasonable for the reasons above. Further I have no evidence to show that 
the amount transferred in 2015 was less than the full value of the policy.
7. He also said there was no evidence of what funds were held in Norwich Union at the 
time they were acquired by Aviva and how that transfer was transacted. This 
question needs to be asked and answered by Aviva with proof.
I do not have any papers surrounding this issue and it is not covered by the existing 
complaint so I have not commented further. 
8. Aviva had not been able/willing to prove its assertion that there had been a computer 
error. Aviva also declined to accept his invitation to send me a sworn statement by 
their in-house legal team that their version of events was truthful. Hence, in the 
absence of Aviva's ability to prove him wrong he asserted his claim remains valid 
and owing to me.
I dont require a sworn statement in order to reach the conclusion I have based my 
view on the evidence presented to me.
9. He also said that my statement that  "The evidence does seem to confirm the money 
was transferred to the SIPP and not returned" would imply that I had also not 
received adequate evidence that I could categorically prove to him that Aviva is in 
the right when actually the substantial evidence I have provided to date puts my 
claim to the refund and lost again fund beyond reasonable doubt.
As I have commented above I have made my decision based on the evidence 
available to me and on balance I dont think I can reasonably conclude that there is 
money remaining in Mr Ms old policy.
The evidence suggests that on balance the amount quoted to him in 2021 from what 
should have been an empty policy is in most likely a relic of a failure to terminate the 
policy fully. I say that because it is clear the total amount transferred was received 
and was not returned.
However it is clear that Mr M was misadvised that there was money in the policy. This 
has sown seeds of doubt in his mind and he has suffered from loss of expectation. Based on my conclusion this was an error which Aviva accepted. I can therefore make 
an award for financial loss and distress and inconvenience.
I dont think there is a financial loss. I say that as Mr M was never entitled to the money 
said to remain in the policy. The law would seek to put him back in the position he would 
have been in but for that error. The error was to quote a value when in fact there was no 
money there. So Mr M has remained in the position he would have been in but for the 
error  which is with no residual money in his policy. So there is no financial loss.
I have however considered an award for distress and inconvenience. Such an award is 
intended to reflect the impact on Mr M and not to punish Aviva. We all experience 
inconvenience in day-to-day life but I think the impact of this error is much greater than 
that. I think Mr M has been put to considerable trouble and upset. On balance I think an 
award of £800 is fair and reasonable in the circumstances so I have not made any 
further award against Aviva.
In summary I think Aviva has dealt with Mr Ms complaint in a fair and reasonable 
manner and made a fair and reasonable offer to pay a total of £800.
My final decision
I have decided that Aviva has made a fair and reasonable offer to pay £800 for distress and 
inconvenience. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 22 April 2023.
