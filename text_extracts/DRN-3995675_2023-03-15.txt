The complaint
Mrs C complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to her the money that she and her late husband paid for some holiday 
club membership points. Shes being represented in her complaint by a claims management 
company.
What happened
Mrs C and her late husband entered into a purchase agreement to buy some additional 
holiday club membership points in October 2012. The price payable for the points was 
£4,800 and they made a payment of £960 so the balance due from them was £3,840. Mrs C 
entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for an interest free 
loan of that amount. She agreed to make 24 monthly repayments of £160 to Barclays 
Partner Finance and the loan was repaid in November 2014. 
Mrs Cs representative sent a letter to Barclays Partner Finance in December 2016 in which 
claims were made under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said that 
the holiday company didnt conduct a proper assessment of Mrs Cs financial position and 
ability to repay the loan, applied considerable pressure to her to procure her agreement to 
the loan and breached EU Law. It also said that the holiday company had misrepresented 
the membership to Mrs C and her husband and that it had breached the contract. 
Barclays Partner Finance provided a detailed response to those claims and it said that it 
couldnt see any grounds to support the allegations based on the information that had been 
provided. Mrs C wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service 
that: a proper assessment of Mrs Cs ability to afford the loan wasnt conducted, Barclays 
Partner Finance paid a commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mrs C 
and the holiday company unduly pressured Mrs C into entering into the agreements  all of 
which rendered the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140A. Mrs Cs husband has now 
sadly passed away.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Cs complaint should be upheld as he didnt 
think that Barclays Partner Finances decision to turn down her claims under sections 75 and 
140A for breach of contract, misrepresentation and an unfair relationship was unfair or 
unreasonable. He wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of sale. 
He said that Mrs Cs claim for breach of contract related to a different type of membership 
that shed bought, funded by a loan from another finance provider, and that shed made a 
separate complaint about that finance provider. He said that he hadnt seen enough to 
suggest that the relationship between Mrs C and Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and 
he wasnt persuaded that a court would reach the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. 
He also said that he hadnt seen anything persuasive to suggest that the lending was 
unaffordable for Mrs C.
Mrs Cs representative, on her behalf, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an 
ombudsman. It has provided a response from Mrs C to our investigators recommendations 
in which she describes the way in which she says that the additional membership points 
were misrepresented. Her representative says that our investigators recommendations are 
manifestly wrong and has described in detail what it says are breaches of applicable 
regulations, including the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts 
Regulations 2010 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. It has 
also described its concerns about the way in which the finance was sold to Mrs C and it has 
provided a generic submission from counsel about the holiday company.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mrs Cs complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or 
services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section 
are met) and section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require 
a creditor to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it 
determines that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mrs Cs claims under sections 75 and 140A as 
only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not Barclays 
Partner Finances response to her claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
Mrs C and her late husband agreed to buy the additional membership points in 
October 2012 and they signed documents including the purchase agreement, the 
terms and conditions, a separate standard form of the withdrawal notice that could be 
given, a key information document, membership exchange documents and the 
holiday companys customer compliance statement  Mrs C also signed a credit 
application, the loan agreement and Barclays Partner Finances customer 
compliance statement; 
the holiday company also provided Mrs C and her husband with a letter which gave 
them the option to convert their points into a new product which was a different type 
of membership  the letter said that the right to use the new product would 
commence in January 2013 and the new membership would last for a minimum term 
of 15 years;
Mrs Cs representatives letter to Barclays Partner Finance in December 2016 
described the way in which it said that the additional membership points had been 
misrepresented to Mrs C and her husband  it says that they were told that they 
needed to purchase them to qualify for the new membership the following year, the 
only way they could exit their existing membership was to purchase that new 
membership and that they would be guaranteed to exit the new membership after 15 
years;
Mrs C and her husband bought the new membership points in April 2013, they traded 
in their existing membership points and paid the balance due by a bank transfer and 
using a loan with another finance provider - Mrs C has made a complaint to this 
service about the other finance provider and that complaint is being dealt with 
separately;
I consider it to be clear from the holiday companys letter to Mrs C and her husband 
that the minimum term of the new membership was 15 years and that there was no 
guarantee that that they would be able to exit that membership after 15 years;the holiday companys compliance statement says: We understand that this 
document, the Purchase Agreement and the documents referred to in it form the 
entire agreement between the parties. We confirm that no oral or written 
representations have been made to us upon which we have relied and which are 
either not contained in the documentation presented to us today or noted by us below 
in the comments box;
Ive carefully considered the terms of the holiday companys letter, the other 
documents that had been signed and Mrs Cs representatives description of the 
misrepresentations, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
the additional membership points that Mrs C and her husband bought in October 
2012 were misrepresented to them or that they were induced into entering into the 
purchase agreement by any misrepresentations made by the holiday company;
Barclays Partner Finance has described the holiday that Mrs C and her late husband 
took using their membership points between November 2013 and July 2017 and Im 
not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach of 
contract by the holiday company or a breach of EU law or any other applicable law 
for which Barclays Partner Finance would be liable in these circumstances;
Ive carefully considered Mrs Cs representatives response to our investigators 
recommendations, but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
theres been a breach of the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange 
Contracts Regulations 2010, the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 
1999 or any other applicable regulation for which Barclays Partner Finance would be 
liable in these circumstances;
Mrs Cs representative says that the holiday company didnt conduct a proper 
assessment of Mrs Cs financial position and ability to repay the loan - Barclays 
Partner Finance has provided a copy of the credit application that was signed by 
Mrs C and which set out her pension income and it has described the steps that it 
took to assess whether the loan was affordable for her;
the loan was made to Mrs C in October 2012, was interest free and was repaid in 
November 2014  Ive seen no evidence to show Mrs C had complained to Barclays 
Partner Finance about the affordability of the loan or the affordability assessment that 
it conducted until December 2016 (more than two years after shed repaid the loan) - 
if she was concerned about the affordability of the loan, I consider that it would be 
reasonable to expect her to have contacted Barclays Partner Finance sooner than 
she did;
Mrs C signed Barclays Partner Finances compliance statement which said: I [am] 
confident that from an income perspective that the repayments will be met now and 
in the future; and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the 
loan wasnt affordable for Mrs C when it was made to her in October 2012 or that the 
loan was mis-sold to Mrs C;
Mrs Cs representative says that the holiday company applied considerable pressure 
to Mrs C to procure her agreement to the loan and unduly pressured her into entering 
into the agreements  but the holiday companys compliance statement that Mrs C 
and her husband signed says: We confirm that we have been treated courteously 
during the sales presentation, that we have been given plenty of time to consider if 
the product is right for us and we have not been put under any pressure to purchase 
our Points;
Mrs C and her husband had signed a separate standard form of the withdrawal 
notice that could be given and, if theyd been unduly pressured into entering into 
those agreements and didnt want to be bound by them, I consider that it would be reasonable to expect them to have withdrawn from the agreements within the 
withdrawal periods  but Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs C complained to the 
holiday company or Barclays Partner Finance about those issues until her 
representatives letter to Barclays Partner Finance in December 2016  more than 
four years later;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs C and her husband 
were unduly pressured into entering into the purchase agreement, that Mrs C was 
unduly pressured into entering into the loan agreement or that the holiday company 
used unacceptable sales practices against them;
Mrs Cs representative says that Barclays Partner Finance should have told her 
about any commission that it paid to the holiday company for arranging the loan  but 
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show what commission, if any, was paid 
by Barclays Partner Finance to the holiday company;
from what this service has seen across the industry, if commission was ever paid it 
tended to be low and of less than 10% and Im satisfied that Barclays Partner 
Finance wouldnt have breached any duty in making any such payment  nor was it 
under any regulatory duty to disclose the amount of any commission paid in these 
circumstances - and I dont consider that the level of any commission that was 
normally paid in this type of situation was sufficiently high to mean that Barclays 
Partner Finance should have appreciated that not disclosing any commission to 
Mrs C risked the relationship being unfair under section 140A;
Mrs Cs representative has provided a generic submission from counsel about the 
holiday company but Im not persuaded that it shows that Mrs Cs relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance was unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mrs Cs relationship 
with Barclays Partner Finance was unfair and I dont consider it to be likely that a 
court would conclude that there was an unfair relationship between Mrs C and 
Barclays Partner Finance in these circumstances;
I consider that Barclays Partner Finances January 2017 response to Mrs Cs claims 
was fair and reasonable and Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show 
that it has acted incorrectly in its dealings with Mrs C about her loan; and
I sympathise with Mrs C for the loss of her husband and the issues that have been 
described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for 
me to require Barclays Partner Finance to refund to her any of the money that she 
paid under the loan agreement, to pay her any compensation or to take any other 
action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Cs complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs C to accept or 
reject my decision before 12 April 2023.
