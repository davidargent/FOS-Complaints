K821x#15complaint
Mr N complains that NewDay Ltd was irresponsible when it gave him a credit card, and then 
some months later increased the amount he was able to borrow. He says although hes paid 
the debt back,  he wants  NewDay to remove any mention  of the arrangement he had to make 
to repay  the debt.
background
Mr N applied for a credit  card with NewDay in March 2014. NewDay agreed to provide a 
card with a limit of £500. About 6 months  later NewDay  offered to increase the limit to 
£1,200 and gave Mr N 40 days to decline this offer if he so wished.
Mr N accepted the new limit (or at least didnt object to it). Some  months  later he couldnt 
afford repayments and made an arrangement with NewDay  to pay the debt off in 
instalments. He did that in 2017.
Mr Ns credit file shows this arrangement   and also that he got behind in making payments 
in 2015. That will show on his file for six years.
Mr N says that if NewDay had carried out proper checks it would have seen  he was 
struggling financially  at the time (ie in 2014), and relying on payday loans to get by. He 
thinks it was irresponsible  for NewDay to lend to him, let alone increase  the limit a short 
while later.
NewDay says it carried its normal checks and nothing on Mr Ns credit file or application 
suggested he couldnt afford  the card he was applying  for. 
Our investigator thought NewDay hadnt done enough. He said Mr Ns credit  file showed 
hed had lots of payday loans. He thought if NewDay had carried out better checks it would  
have seen Mr N couldnt afford any more credit.  NewDay  didnt agree  it said there was 
only an old, low value default on Mr Ns file, and no outstanding payday loans. So there  
wasnt anything that suggested it should  have made  more in depth enquiries  at the time.
Since then theres  been some dispute about  what was recorded   and NewDay  has pointed 
out that Mr N made some  applications for credit from a different address than the one he 
used when applying  for his card.
Ive been asked to decide this complaint.
 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Id like to make a couple of general  points before I look at the particulars of this complaint.
First, NewDay  said Mr N had been  applying for credit from other lenders from a different 
address than the one he used when applying for his NewDay card. Im not convinced  this 
should make  much  of a difference, as credit files generally cover  all addresses used by an 
individual. So wherever Mr N had been  living, his credit file would reflect the amount  of credit 
he had.
Ref: DRN29111712Moving on from that point,  NewDay will be aware  that it should have been  checking whether 
Mr N could reasonably  afford the credit it offered each time it offered credit  so both when 
Mr N initially applied for the card and each time NewDay suggested an increase in a limit. 
Those requirements are outlined in two different sets of guidance (because this changed  
between Mr N applying for the card and the increase being  offered)  but the essentials  are 
the same. 
In particular Reasonably  afford goes further than Mr N being able to meet the minimum 
payment requirements  on a monthly basis: NewDay should also have checked Mr N would  
be able to repay the whole debt within a reasonable amount of time. 
How NewDay  assessed whether Mr N could afford the card or any limit increase is for 
NewDay to decide,  as theres no set list of checks. But they do have to be appropriate and 
proportionate. NewDay says it carried out its normal  checks and looked at Mr Ns credit file 
and his income when it first agreed to give Mr N a card.
the initial card application
I cant see that NewDay asked Mr N about his normal monthly outgoings.  Instead  it made  
assumptions about what he might have  spent using industry databases. I think  that was a 
failing as it doesnt explore whether Mr Ns particular  circumstances affect his ability to repay 
a debt.
Mr N has kindly sent us a credit report that shows his borrowing in late March 2014  thats  
when he first got the card. Ive looked at it carefully. I can see Mr N had short term loans in 
the months leading up to him applying for the card. They  seem  mostly to have been for a few 
days each month. NewDay acknowledges that Mr N had had about eight loans  although 
hed repaid most of these. There was one loan outstanding at the time. The repayments 
were a fairly  modest £54 a month.  
I think the existence of these loans should have prompted NewDay to make some  further  
enquiries before it lent to Mr N. If it had done that I think it would have found that Mr N 
couldnt afford more  credit  than he already had. Ive looked at Mr Ns bank statements to see 
what was happening,  and I think NewDay could have done that if it had so wished. 
If it had made further enquiries, NewDay would have found that in the months before he 
applied for the card Mr N was almost permanently overdrawn and paid a fee for an 
unarranged overdraft at one point.  Over  the two months of January and February he had 
about six short term loans  and the repayments  were for about half of his monthly  wage. 
Given that Mr N was only earning about  £900  a month that didnt leave him much  for  normal 
living expenses, and we know he had rent and other outgoings at the time.  
I think that if NewDay had carried out proportionate checks it wouldnt have provided the 
card. So I think it lent irresponsibly.
the limit increase
Given I dont think NewDay should  have provided the card initially, it follows that I dont think 
it should have  been offering an increased credit limit. But its possible Mr N might have been 
able to manage the credit card well  so I accept  that NewDay could have looked at his card 
usage and decided to increase the limit. But I can see NewDay had been writing to Mr N 
Ref: DRN29111713about missed payments  and being over his (lower limit)  and I cant  see NewDay  sought 
any explanation  for this. In addition Mr N was only making minimum payments on his 
NewDay card  so his debt wasnt decreasing. 
Even without  making further enquiries  this suggests Mr N wasnt managing his finances, and 
I think it was irresponsible  for NewDay to increase his limit.
putting things  right
I think NewDay should put Mr N in the position hed have been in if it hadnt  increased his 
limit. 
To do that it should:
Refund all interest  and charges that Mr N paid from when the credit
card was accepted  in March 2014  to when it was closed in July 2017
Pay interest of 8% simple interest on the refund  amount*
Remove all information about  the NewDay credit card from Mr Ns credit
File
*HM Revenue & Customs requires NewDay to pay tax on this interest. NewDay must 
provide Mr N with a certificate showing how much tax has been taken off if he asks for
one.
my final decision
My decision  is that I uphold this complaint and order NewDay  Ltd to take the actions outlined 
above.
 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr N to accept or 
reject my decision  before 10 October  2019.
