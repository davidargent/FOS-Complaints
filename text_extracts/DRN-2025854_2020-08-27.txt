The complaint
Mr C complains that BMW Financial Services (GB) Limited (BMWFS) overcharged him for 
damages when he returned a car at the end of a finance agreement.
What happened
Mr C acquired a car which was three years old funded by a finance agreement. The 
agreement came to an end after three years and the car was collected by an agent acting for 
BMWFS. The report records that the car had four scuffed alloys and two other scratches. 
BMWFS sent Mr C an invoice for £370.
He disputed this but BMWFS said the damage went beyond fair wear and tear as defined by 
the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA) guidelines. Mr C brought his 
complaint to this service where it was considered by one of our investigators. He noted that 
the car was six years old and had done over 70,000 miles when it was collected and that he 
expected the level of wear and tear would be greater than on a newer car.
He thought that the BVRLA guidelines needed to be considered in the light of the age and 
mileage of the car. He concluded that the damage didnt go beyond fair wear and tear. 
BMWFS didnt agree and said it had spoken to BVRLA which had advised that the vehicle 
has been inspected correctly for its age. It also noted that it had been sold three years earlier 
by an approved retailer and would have had to meet a standard for resale.

What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It is not disputed that there were several areas of damage to the car. The key issue is 
whether these fall within fair wear and tear. As has been pointed out by both the business 
and our investigator the standard used in the industry is set down by the BVRLA.
The guidance is usually used for newer cars that have been returned at the end of their first 
finance agreement, so we mainly use it to consider damage to cars that are four years old or less. However, we can refer to the guide even if we are considering complaints involving 
used or older cars. 
The guide says that age and mileage are factors which need to be taken into account when 
considering what would be deemed fair wear and tear. This applies to all cars but older cars, 
or cars with higher mileage, might therefore require a slightly different application of the 
guide. This is because its likely the older or higher the mileage of a car the more reasonable 
wear and tear it will likely suffer. This means that in cases where the car is older and/or with 
higher mileage we may apply a broader approach than whats explicitly set out in the BVRLA 
guidance. 
In this complaint the car was six years old and had done some 74,000 miles. That means we 
have to interpret the guidelines in the light of those factors. As such, I find myself in 
agreement with our investigator that the scuffs on the alloys and the two scratches are no  
more than one would find on a typical car of that age and mileage. I have noted that all the 
items were repairable which indicates the level of damage wasnt extensive. I would add that 
I have taken into account the claim by BMWFS that the car when sold three years previously 
would have been in good condition

Putting things right
Given the age of the car and the mileage I don't consider that the damage is excessive or 
more than simple wear and tear
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint and I direct BMW Financial Services (GB) 
Limited to:
Remove all damage charges put forward to Mr C.Remove any adverse information on his credit file because of these charges.
Pay Mr C £100 compensation for the trouble and upset caused.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 September 2020.
