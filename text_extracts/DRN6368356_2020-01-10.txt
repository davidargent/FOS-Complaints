K820x#14complaint
Mr H complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) wont  refund transactions he
disputes from his account.
background
I have already set out the background to this complaint in my provisional decision, I have 
attached that to this decision.  Ive also summarised the events and the complaint below.
Mr H says he was impersonated  when someone called RBS trying to increase his withdrawal 
limit and order new cards and PINs on his current and savings accounts.  
When RBS contacted him about this he said the calls werent made by him. Shortly after this 
online banking was set up on Mr Hs account, which he says wasnt  him either and money 
transferred from his savings to his current account. New cards were  issued on both of his 
accounts and one of those cards  was used to make several cash  withdrawals and 
purchases, all of which Mr H says wasnt him. 
In total Mr H says he suffered losses of £10,950,66 and incurred a debt on his overdraft of 
£448.06. 
In my provisional decision I explained  why I was not minded to uphold  Mr Hs complaint. I set 
out my findings and I invited any further comments from both parties before reconsidering 
the complaint.  
RBS responded  to say it agreed  with my findings.  Mr H did not agree, in summary he said:
-he was advised  to go to branch and the fraud  team  advised  him that his cards would 
be cancelled and new cards for all accounts  would be ordered and he should  collect 
them from the branch;
-he has provided an email from a member of staff at RBS which repeats Mr Hs 
version of events; that one card was sent to branch  but the other wasnt; 
-he told RBS repeatedly that someone was trying  to use his account and RBS needed 
to stop this; 
-he told RBS he was not going  to use his accounts and had never  used online 
banking, he says this is in all the calls he made  to the bank and these should be 
considered; and
-he thinks someone at the branch is involved in taking his money.
As Ive said,  I have attached my provisional  decision as this sets out my initial thoughts  on 
Mr Hs complaint, I will go on to address Mr Hs follow up points here in my final decision and 
comment further on my previous provisional findings.
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, Ive come to the same 
overall conclusions  as those set out in my provisional findings and Ill explain why. 
In my provisional decision I set out several  anomalies and events that Mr H had not been  
able to explain or did not reconcile with his version of events. Mr H has answered  and 
provided some evidence in response  to one of those points but hasnt responded to or been 
Ref: DRN63683562able to provide  me with any plausible or compelling  information which  would change my 
overall findings here. 
Mr H has explained that it was RBS that advised  him to cancel both cards on his accounts, 
which is plausible and I accept likely  to have happened given he said he was being  
impersonated on the phone. Mr H has also provided  an email from an RBS member  of staff 
recording Mr Hs version of events;  that one card was sent to branch and the other  to his 
home. RBS hasnt been able to provide information about where the savings  card was 
dispatched to. But even if I accept that one card was sent to branch and the other  to Mr Hs 
home address that doesnt persuade me that the card sent to his home address was 
intercepted and used by someone other than Mr H or by someone acting without his 
knowledge or consent.
Other than this Mr H hasnt been  able to explain any of the other events set out in my 
provisional findings, most of which are pivotal in concluding that it was either Mr H who 
authorised these transactions or that he gave  his account security information to someone 
else and in doing so failed  with intent to keep his account security  information safe. 
In response to his comments I have  also listened  to all the calls RBS has been able to 
provide between Mr H and RBS and I havent  seen any evidence of the calls he has referred  
to where he told the bank  to stop or block his accounts or that he wouldnt be using them  
until after the disputed  transactions  had occurred. 
I havent seen  any evidence to suggest  branch  staff at RBS were involved in these  
transactions. The card and PIN that were used to make the disputed transactions  were 
dispatched from a centralised location  and sent directly to Mr Hs home  address. Whilst I 
appreciate they could  have been  intercepted by someone I dont  think  this is the most likely 
explanation (as set out in my provisional decision). And I because of this it also doesnt  
seem likely that a member of staff at the branch  would have been able to intercept the card 
and PIN to use either. 
In summary  Im not persuaded by the additional information Mr H has provided.  As set out in 
my provisional decision. On balance the evidence persuades me that Mr H either; made 
these transactions,  authorised someone else to make them or gave away his security 
information in order for someone to use his account, perhaps not expecting his savings to be 
spent as they were. But in any of these scenarios the bank is entitled to hold Mr H liable for 
the disputed transactions.
my final decision
As Ive set out above, I do not uphold Mr Hs complaint against  RBS. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 9 February  2020.

complaint
Mr H complains that The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS)  wont refund transactions he disputes 
from his account.
background
Mr H says he received  a call from RBS in February 2017.  They asked him if he had asked to increase 
his overdraft  and if he was going  on holiday  or had tried to order new cards,  then he was told there 
was suspicious activity on his account and he should go to a branch.  
RBS confirms they received  several calls regarding  Mr Hs account  27 February 2017 but because of 
some concerns about the requests the caller was advised to go to branch. There had been attempts  
to increase Mr Hs withdrawal limit and order new cards on two of his accounts. There is a record to 
show Mr H spoke to RBS on 28 February where  he said the calls to increase his overdraft had been 
fraudulent and he was being impersonated.
Ref: DRN63683564Mr H says he checked his account was safe by withdrawing £10 on 28 February  2017. RBS records 
also show that Mr Hs card was then destroyed in the branch on 28 February. A new card was not 
requested or ordered at this time.
On 16 March  2017  online banking was set up on Mr Hs account. Mr H says this was not him. But Mr 
H says he did receive a text to register for online  banking  which he didnt request. Mr H also says that 
around this time his mobile phone stopped working. RBS says in order to set up online  banking 
someone would need Mr Hs name, address,  date of birth, sort code, account number and card 
details, an active card on one of his accounts and a card reader. The only active card Mr H had this 
time was for his savings  account ending *4454. 
On 17 March  2017,  Mr H has confirmed  he attended a branch and requested for a replacement debit 
card and new PIN to be issued on his account ending  *3168.  Its recorded that the previous card was 
marked on RBSs system as stolen but it was destroyed in branch on 28 February  2017. Mr H also 
says he ordered a new card and PIN for his savings  account. He said he asked for these to be sent to 
the branch rather than to his home  address as he was worried about  fraud. 
RBS says there is no record of a request to send the card and PIN to branch. RBSs records for the 
account ending  *3168 show that Mr Hs address was checked at this time in branch so it believes Mr 
H didnt request  for the card and PIN to be sent to branch. RBS hasnt  yet been able to provide me 
with a card and PIN history for Mr Hs savings  account.  But the new card and PIN for his current  
account were  sent to his home  address  which  Mr H says he didnt receive. 
Following this there were  disputed  transactions made using the card and PIN for his current account 
and these were funded by transfers from Mr Hs savings account  which  he also says werent  made  
by him. A fraudulent  deposit  is made into the account as well.  
Mr Hs losses  are limited to the money transferred from his savings account which  was £10,415, the 
credit balance  on his current account which was £535.62 and the debt which was created  on his 
account after the spending, which was £448.06. As this wasnt repaid a default  was registered  in 
2017.
RBS says the activity  flagged  on its systems and Mr H was sent an automated  call to confirm if the 
payments were genuine.  RBS says where  it cant reach its customer the system  will leave a voicemail 
asking for the customer  to call back. RBS has shown  that it holds the same number on its file that Mr 
H has also provided  us so it appears to be his correct and genuine number. RBS says it received a 
response to confirm the transactions were genuine.  Mr H says he didnt receive contact from the bank 
and he thinks this is because he had problems  with his phone where his SIM was swapped. 
RBS wrote to Mr H to say it was closing his accounts. There was an overdraft on his current  account, 
if this wasnt  repaid a default would be registered.  RBS also concluded that the transactions were 
either made or authorised by Mr H and didnt offer to refund the disputed  transactions.

period of the disputed transactions:

For the account ending *3168  from RBSs records it would appear as though Mr H had the same self-
selected PIN since December  2014.  The notes say the previous card (the one Mr H used on 28 
February for the £10) was replaced on 17 March and a new PIN was requested as well. 
Ref: DRN63683566We have  asked Mr H to provide information about the issues hes had with his phone  but he hasnt 
been able to provide anything.
Our investigator reviewed the matter. She found that Mr Hs evidence  was not persuasive and there 
were several events that he could not explain. As a result she thought  it was more likely than not that 
Mr H either made the transactions himself or authorised  them and therefore  didnt think  the bank 
needed to refund the disputed transactions.
Mr H has since told our investigator that he repeatedly  told the bank not to put through any 
transactions on his account  because  he says he was worried about  fraud.  She looked into this matter 
but RBS couldnt find any records of Mr H making any requests  of this nature. Mr H hasnt provided 
anything else to support his version of events  or explain what  was discussed in any detail.
As Mr H didnt agree  with the investigators findings the complaint has been passed to me to issue a 
final decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive come to same conclusions as our investigator but I have reviewed additional  
evidence in reaching  my conclusions because of this it would be fair to both parties to set out the 
evidence and my findings  to allow both parties to respond before considering the complaint for a final 
decision. 
In summary my provisional findings are that on balance  the most likely  explanation here is that Mr H 
either authorised  these  transactions and payments or he gave his account  security information to 
someone else and in doing  so failed  with intent to keep his account security information  safe. In either  
scenario Im persuaded that RBS is entitled to hold Mr H liable for the transactions. Ill explain why.
I accept its possible that Mr H couldve been targeted and his accounts used without his knowledge. 
But in order to do this fraudsters would  have needed enough information  to register for online 
banking, using his card for account ending *4454 and a card reader, and then they needed to 
intercept the new card and PIN to make the transactions from his current  account  ending *3168, 
which involved a mixture  of counter transactions in the branch as well as ATM and point of sale 
transactions. Considering all of this I dont think this is the most  likely explanation. I say this because:
-Mr H says the calls made to RBS to increase his overdraft and those  requests over the phone  
to order  new cards and PINs were not made him. He says he was being  impersonated.  It 
looks as though RBS also had some  concerns at the time as the caller was referred  to 
branch. But what Mr H hasnt been able to explain is why he then went  to branch to order  a 
new card and PIN on both his savings and current accounts on 17 March  (the same thing he 
says a fraudster  was trying to do when impersonating him).  Mr H also hasnt  been able to 
explain why he needed  a new card and PIN on his savings account  given that he hadnt used 
the account since  June  2016.
-It appears as though Mr T took his card for his current account to branch  to be destroyed  on 
28 February but didnt order  a new one at this time. So Mr H went without  a card on his 
current account for at least a couple weeks. This is unusual given he thought he had been 
impersonated at this point. In addition to this Mr H hasnt explained why he ordered  a new 
PIN when  he ordered  a new card in March 2017. He had the same PIN for several  years 
which he had changed  to a self-selected PIN. He hasnt  said that he thought his PIN had 
been compromised  in any way so its not clear why he ordered  a new PIN at this time.  Again 
this is the same action the caller was making prior to this (which Mr H says was someone 
impersonating him).
Ref: DRN63683567-Mr H says when in branch on 17 March, he asked for the new card and PIN to be delivered to 
the branch as he was concerned about fraud. But RBS doesnt have a record of this. Its 
records show that his address was checked in branch which  would suggest  the opposite; that 
he was happy for his card and PIN to go to his home address. Mr H hasnt explained  why he 
thought there would  be a problem receiving  a new card and PIN at his home. He hasnt said 
he had any other post problems and there hadnt been any disputed  transactions on his 
account before he ordered  the new card and PIN in March 2017. 
-Mr H has said he also ordered a new card and PIN for his savings account at the same time 
which did go to branch. RBS hasnt  been able to provide me with any card and PIN history for 
this account. And Mr H hasnt said when  he collected these. If Mr H has any other information  
about this I would be happy  to consider it.
-Mr H says he was shocked when  he received the text to register for online banking on 16 
March but I cant  see that he raised this with RBS at the time.  RBS has told us he would have 
received an email rather than a text. Either  way it appears Mr H is saying he was aware 
online banking had been set-up. If he didnt request online banking and was worried about 
fraud on his account  I wouldve expected him to notify the bank so this could  be blocked, but I 
cant see that he did this. And this is even more surprising given that he was in branch the 
day after it was set up but doesnt appear to have raised it with the bank.
-I accept  its possible  that some of the information used to set up online banking  could be 
obtained without Mr Hs authority or without him giving  this information  to someone. But as 
well as this information a fraudster would also have needed to intercept  Mr Hs new card and 
PIN in order to make any use of the access to online banking or the funds in his account  as 
well use an active card on the account and a card reader.  The online banking was set up 
before Mr H had even  attended the branch to request a new card and PIN. The only active  
card on the account  was for the account ending  *4454 and Mr H hasnt said anyone  else had 
access to this card or that it was missing at all. Thats a lot of information for a fraudster  to 
obtain, some  of which Mr H hasnt said was missing or not within his possession.
-Its also unusual that a fraudster would set up online  banking and then coincidentally Mr H 
order a new card and PIN the next day which were then intercepted. Mr H hasnt been able 
explain to how anyone else would have known he had ordered  a new card and PIN or how it 
might have been intercepted given he thought it was going to the branch.  
-On 16 March online banking  was set up. Six minutes after this there is a payment made  
between Mr Hs accounts for £35. The next day that payment is transferred back  to the 
account it came  from and RBS says this was done in branch. This is the same day that Mr H 
is in branch ordering  a new card and PIN. So I think its likely that he also made  this transfer. 
It wouldnt make  sense  for a fraudster to transfer this money and then send it back. On that 
basis it would appear Mr H knew  about the transfer into the account  in order to reverse it in 
branch. If he didnt  make  the online transfer then why wasnt he concerned about the online 
payment into his account (when  he says he hadnt set up online banking). Considering  all of 
this I think  its more likely  that Mr H did know about the payment. And if he did make or know 
about the reversal payment then Im persuaded it was him who set up the online banking or it 
was set up with his authority.
-Mr H told RBS he had problems  with his phone on the 17 March 2017. He believed  hed been 
the victim  of a SIM swap. Later  when the bank explained they had sent verification to his 
mobile number to check the payments were genuine he said the phone issues were actually  
at the time which was the 22 March 2017. I find it unusual  that Mr H changed  the date of the 
events here  given that the detail  of story  he gave  around  it being  on 17 March.  
-Weve asked Mr H if he could provide any evidence about his contact  with the phone 
company or to show the problems  he had with his mobile phone.  Mr H hasnt been able to 
Ref: DRN63683568provide anything to support his mobile phone wasnt working or that it had any issues around 
the time of the disputed transactions. RBSs records dont show that it recorded  a SIM swap 
had occurred  either. During one of these calls where  a PIN reminder is requested  (a call says 
Mr H wasnt  made  by him) a text is sent to Mr Hs phone. The caller is asked to read this out 
as part of the security process. The caller reads this out. Based on both the above events  it 
seems more likely that either Mr H confirmed the payments as being genuine or allowed 
someone else to use his phone to verify the texts in those calls.
-Mr H says he attended  the branch on 17 March 2017  to request a new card and PIN and 
reported the disputed transactions on the 03 April 2017 but he hasnt explained why he didnt 
contact the bank  earlier  when the card and PIN didnt arrive. He knew to expect the card and 
PIN or a call from the bank to say they were in branch (if requested  to go to the branch) but I 
cant see that he queried  this.
-Mr H went  into branch  on 03 April to report the fraud but he hasnt explain why he went in that 
day, the day after all the funds from his accounts had been spent. He says he was visiting  the 
branch regularly  during this time,  but if thats the case Id have  expected to see the disputed 
transactions being picked up earlier  or the fact that his card and PIN hadnt arrived wouldve 
caused concern with branch staff. As this didnt happen Im not persuaded  Mr H did visit the 
branch regularly  as he says. Which  means  he hasnt  given a persuasive  reason for the 
visiting the branch on that day.
Overall Im not persuaded by Mr Hs version of events, hes changed this several times over the 
course of both our investigation and the banks. On balance the evidence persuades me that Mr H 
either; made these  transactions,  authorised someone else to make them  or gave away  his security 
information in order for someone  to use his account, perhaps  not expecting  his savings to be spent as 
they were. But in any of these scenarios the bank is entitled to hold Mr H liable for the disputed  
transactions.
my provisional  decision
As Ive set out above, I dont intend  to uphold Mr Hs complaint against The Royal Bank of Scotland  
Plc.
Ill give both parties two weeks to provide a response or any further information  before reviewing the 
complaint again and issuing my final decision.
