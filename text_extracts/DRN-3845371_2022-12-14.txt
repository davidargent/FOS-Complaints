The complaint
Miss P complains AXA Insurance UK Plc trading as Swiftcover incorrectly charged her an 
additional premium for a car insurance policy.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. Instead, Ill focus on providing my reasons for my decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
AXA has admitted it failed to update Miss Ps record on receipt of proof of her no 
claims discount. This led to her being charged an additional premium. 
AXA apologised, arranged for the money to be refunded on the same day and 
offered Â£150 compensation. I think this is sufficient to put right the mistake it made. 
Mistakes do happen, the fact Miss P had to make a call to AXA about this matter, 
while inconvenient, doesnt lead me to think an increased amount of compensation is 
due.
Miss P has raised concerns about AXA holding her card details, the policy document 
does explain that some details are held. I dont find this unusual. If Miss P is 
concerned AXA is holding on to data related to her longer than it needs to, then this 
is a complaint she may be able to raise with the Information Commissioners office. 
For these reasons, I do not uphold this complaint.
My final decision
My final decision is that I reject Miss Ps complaint against AXA Insurance UK Plc trading as 
Swiftcover.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 January 2023.
