The complaint
 Mrs R says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) gave her loans 
irresponsibly. 
What happened
 Mrs R took 37 loans with Sunny between November 2015 and August 2019. Each of these 
loans was due to be repaid over a period of six months  but Mrs R repaid some of the loans 
early. Some of Mrs Rs loans overlapped with one another. A summary of the first 11 loans is 
shown below.

* The maximum combined repayment figure is sometimes made up of multiple payments 
when the loans overlapped.
**I havent calculated the highest repayment for loan 8 onwards due to the pattern of 
lending from this point.Our adjudicator considered the complaint and he recommended Sunny refund the interest 
and charges from loan 7 onwards (and make amendments to Mrs Rs credit file) as it 
appeared that Mrs R had become reliant on this form of lending. 
Sunny did not agree but made an offer to settle the complaint from loan 12 onwards. Mrs R 
accepted the adjudicators view.
As the case could not be resolved informally, it has been passed to me for a decision. As 
there is no dispute about loans 1-6 and loans 12  37, my decision will focus on those loans 
in dispute by Sunny; loans 7-11. Although, I've taken the earlier loans into account when 
looking at the overall pattern of lending.
 What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account all the 
relevant rule, guidance and good industry practice.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when Sunny lent to Mrs R. The 
FCAs Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC) is the specialist sourcebook for credit-related 
regulated activities. It sets out the rules and guidance specific to consumer credit providers, 
such as Sunny. 
It is important to note that the FCA didnt, and doesnt, specify exactly how an assessment of 
affordability is to be carried out but the extent and scope and the types and sources of 
information to use needed to be enough to be able to reasonably assess the sustainability 
of the arrangement for the consumer.
In other words, the assessment needs to be consumer-focussed. It is not an assessment of 
the risk to the lender of not recovering the credit but of the risk to the consumer of incurring 
financial difficulties or experiencing significant adverse consequence as a result of the 
decision to lend.
As set out in CONC, the risk to the consumer directly relates to the particulars of the lending 
and the circumstances of the consumer. Therefore, a lenders assessment of 
creditworthiness would likely need to be flexible. That is to say, what is sufficient for one 
consumer might not be for another, or indeed what might be sufficient for a consumer in one 
circumstance might not be so for the same consumer in other circumstances.
Bearing the above in mind, I would expect an assessment of creditworthiness to vary with 
circumstance. In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance, the greater the 
potential risk to the consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. 
Certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include, 
but are not limited to:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
Sunny told us it undertakes eligibility, creditworthiness and affordability checks before 
deciding whether to provide a loan. But by the time Mrs R asked for loan 7, Sunny should 
have done more than rely on the information she was providing about her finances. I think it 
should have taken steps at that time to independently verify Mrs Rs true financial position. 
However, I dont think I need to recreate individual, proportionate affordability checks for 
loans 7 to 11 in this case. This is because there may even come a point where the lending 
history and pattern of lending itself demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Mrs R could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
The loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. And, 
although Mrs R may have repaid some loans early, it doesnt automatically follow that she 
managed to repay them in a sustainable way. This is because CONC defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make 
repayments on time, while meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without 
having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
It follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.
So, Ive looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs R, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Rs case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 7. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs R was not managing to repay 
herloans sustainably. Mrs R had taken out 7 loans within four and a half months and 
Mrs R had been indebted to Sunny for all but two days. So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mrs R was having to borrow further to cover the 
hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Mrs Rs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
 
Mrs Rs first loan was for £500 and loan 7 was for the same amount.  At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that Mrs R was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in her income but to meet an ongoing need.
 
 From loan 7 onwards Mrs R was provided with a new loan within days of settling a 
previous one.
 
Mrs R wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 37 was 
taken out almost four years after Mrs Rs first. And it was for the same amount. Mrs R 
had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a debt to Sunny over an 
extended period.
 I think that Mrs R lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 7 
onwards. These loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Rs indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive credit intended for short-term use. The sheer number of loans was 
more likely than not to have had negative implications on Mrs Rs ability to access 
mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So, Im upholding the complaint about loans 7 to 11 as well as loans already upheld by 
Sunny (loans 12-37) and Sunny should put things right as set out below.
Putting things right
 Sunny shouldnt have given Mrs R loans 7 to 37 and should put things right as set out 
below.
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs R towards interest, fees and 
charges on these loans.
 
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs R which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs R originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
 
C. Pay Mrs R the total of A plus B.
 
D. The overall pattern of borrowing for loans 7-37 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans entirely from Mrs Rs 
credit file. 
 
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct tax from this interest. Sunny should give 
Mrs R a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
 My final decision is that I partly uphold Mrs R's complaint and Elevate Credit International 
Limited (trading as Sunny) should put things right as set out above.
 Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision before 4 June 2020.
