The complaint
Miss U complains that National Westminster Bank Plc closed her accounts and hasnt 
explained why it no longer wanted her as a customer. Shes also unhappy that NatWest held 
onto the money in her accounts.
What happened
Miss U had a current and saving accounts with NatWest.
In late 2019, Miss U applied to open an ISA account with NatWest. NatWest reviewed 
Miss Us application, which included completing security and credit checks. Following this, 
on 5 December 2019, NatWest decided to close Miss Us accounts. 
The bank wrote to Miss U to let her know that her accounts would be closed on 31 
December 2019 and asked her to complete a funds release form so that it could return her 
balance to an account of her choice. NatWest told Miss U that this process could take up to 
60 days to complete.  
On 17 December 2019, Miss U called NatWest to try and find out what was happening with 
her accounts. NatWest said it hadnt done anything wrong and had closed Miss Us accounts 
in line with the terms and conditions. It also said it wasnt obliged to provide Miss U with an 
explanation for why it no longer wanted her as a customer. NatWest released Miss Us 
balances to her on 31 December 2020.
Miss U has explained that she was alerted by HMRC that her personal tax account had been 
hacked by fraudsters who attempted to submit a false tax claim. Miss U suspects this is the 
reason NatWest closed her accounts. And she has provided letters she got from HMRC to 
support what had happened. She also gave them to NatWest to review and asked the bank 
to reconsider the closure of her accounts. NatWest looked at what Miss U had provided but 
declined to reopen Miss Us accounts.
Miss U says she had no access to the money in her accounts from 5 December 2019 until 
31 December 2021. She has explained that she had to borrow money from her parents to 
get by and had difficulty paying her bills as she couldnt use the money in her accounts. She 
says her mental health suffered, and it was very upsetting. So, she wants NatWest to pay 
her Â£355,000 compensation.
One of our investigators looked into Miss Us complaint. He said NatWest hadnt done 
anything wrong when it had closed Miss Us accounts. And had released Miss Us balances 
in line with its processes. Miss U disagreed. And asked for an ombudsman to review her 
complaint.
As no agreement could be reached the matter has come to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its clear from what Miss U has told us and the bank that she feels very strongly about her 
complaint. But for me to uphold this complaint, I must be satisfied that the bank has done 
something wrong. And in this case, I dont think it has. Ill explain why. 
Firstly, banks are entitled to decide for themselves whether to do business or continue doing 
business with someone if they dont consider it appropriate to do so. Thats because it has 
the commercial freedom to decide who it wants as a customer. And unless theres a good 
reason to do so, this service wont usually say that a bank must keep a customer. But they 
shouldnt decline to open an account without proper reason, for instance of unfair bias or 
unlawful discrimination. And they must treat new and existing customers fairly. 
NatWest has explained that it is a normal part of its process to carry out further checks after 
it receives an account application, which included looking at information recorded at credit 
and fraud prevention agencies. I havent seen anything to suggest that NatWest treated 
Miss Us application differently. Following completion of these checks NatWest decided to 
close Miss Us accounts. NatWest is entitled to do this, so whilst I can appreciate Miss U 
was no doubt upset, I dont think NatWest acted unfairly when it decided it no longer wanted  
to offer Miss U banking services. And Im not going to ask NatWest to reopen Miss Us 
accounts.
Banks should however give a customer reasonable notice about its intention to close an 
account. Looking at the terms and conditions of Miss Us accounts, NatWest could close the 
accounts by giving her 60 days notice. But it can be less. And under certain circumstances 
NatWest can close an account immediately. Ive reviewed the terms and conditions and 
circumstances of this complaint, and Im satisfied NatWest acted in line with them, so, it was 
entitled to close the accounts as it has already done. 
I can see that NatWest wrote to Miss U on 5 December 2019 and gave her just under a 
months notice that she needed to make alternative banking arrangements. Having looked at 
all the evidence I dont think this was unreasonable and it gave Miss U enough time to find 
another bank account and rearrange her finances. 
I know Miss U wants NatWest to explain why it closed her accounts and no longer wanted 
her as a customer. She suspects their reasoning has something to do with the attempted 
HMRC fraud on her tax account.  But the bank isnt obliged to share this with Miss U. So, I 
cant say it has done anything wrong by not giving Miss U this information, however, much 
shed like to know. And it wouldnt be appropriate for me to require it to do so.
Miss U has explained that she wasnt able to access the money in her account and had to 
ask her parents for money. Shes said that she also had trouble paying bills and all in all it 
was very worrying and inconvenient. So, Miss U wants NatWest to pay her sizeable 
compensation. 
I appreciate that NatWests actions caused Miss U real inconvenience and the situation was 
no doubt upsetting. But I can see that NatWest asked Miss U to complete a funds release 
form when it wrote to her on 5 December 2019, and again when it spoke to her on 17 
December 2019. In its letter NatWest also explained that the return of Miss Us funds could 
take up to 60 days. The bank has explained this was its standard procedure and I accept 
that it was. 
Miss U didnt comply with NatWests request. Its not clear why she didnt do so.  But I can 
see in any event NatWest released Miss Us funds back to her on 31 December 2019, which was well within its 60 day timeframe. So, it wouldnt be appropriate for me to make an award 
of compensation for that since, I dont believe NatWest acted inappropriately in taking the 
actions it did. 
In summary, I recognise how strongly Miss U feels about whats happened, and I dont doubt 
it was a frustrating and upsetting time. So, I realise she will be disappointed by my decision. 
But overall, based on the evidence Ive seen, I cant say NatWest has acted unreasonably 
and treated Miss U unfairly when it closed her accounts. So, I wont be asking NatWest to do 
anything.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss U to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 February 2022.
