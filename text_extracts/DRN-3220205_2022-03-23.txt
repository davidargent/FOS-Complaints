DRN-3220205
The complaint
Mr D complains that AvantCredit of UK, LLC (trading as AvantCredit) did not process 
payments made by him and incorrectly cancelled a payment plan that he had with it on a 
number of occasions causing him stress and anxiety.
What happened
Mr D agreed a payment plan in April 2021 with AvantCredit where he was due to make 
monthly payments of £15. Mr D made these payments but AvantCredit did not apply these to 
his account and cancelled his payment plan on a number of occasions. I will outline his 
complaint further when I also give the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator and upholding Mr 
Ds complaint. I will explain why.
Mr D says he had a payment plan with AvantCredit, set up so that he could make payments 
against his outstanding loan. This payment plan started in April 2021. He says that on at 
least four occasions, it has cancelled the plan stating payments have not been made, where 
in fact he had made them. Mr D has told our service that he has contacted AvantCredit on 
each occasion and has had his plan re-instated. He says AvantCredit has told him the 
reason why his payment has not been applied to his account in time, is because of the 
payment method that he has been using, that of a standing order. He says AvantCredit has 
told him that its system does not automatically pick this payment up and it has to look for it 
and then manually apply the payment to his account. Mr D says AvantCredit has had plenty 
of time to do this. He says he has set his standing order to make payment on the 12th of 
each month and he has to make payment by the 25th of each month, giving almost 2 weeks 
for AvantCredit to manually move the payment to his account, but on at least four occasions 
this hasnt happened.
AvantCredit has apologised to Mr D for what has happened for 2 payments in June and July 
that it didnt apply to his account in time. It did this in its final response letter to him. It has 
explained within its final response that a standing order is not one of its usual payment 
methods and the payments do have to be applied manually to his account on its system. It 
then recommended to him using different payment methods and also at this stage offered to 
pay £50 in compensation for what it describes as failings that it identified. 
Our investigator looked into all of this and found that there were further occasions when Mr 
Ds payments were not picked up by AvantCredit, after Mr D made a complaint to our 
service. These occasions also resulted in the same outcome with Mr D needing to contact it 
to reinstate the payment plan. The investigator upheld Mr Ds complaint and recommended 
AvantCredit pay an additional £100 alongside the initial £50 offered by AvantCredit, for the 
stress and worry that all of this has caused especially as the same issues continued after the 
complaint was brought by Mr D to our service.  
I have read through all of the documentation supplied by AvantCredit and have read what Mr 
D has said carefully. I can see that all that Mr D has told our service has happened the way 
he has described it. And I can see that AvantCredit has gone some way to resolve his 
concerns by apologising and offering to pay compensation of £50 for the failings that it 
outlined in its final response. I can also see from a letter provided by Mr D that it looks like 
the outstanding balance of the loan is now being dealt with by a third party. So, with this 
being the case, it looks like the same issue wont be reoccurring in the future.  
But I do agree with the investigator, that AvantCredit ought to have done more to have 
rectified the issue after Mr D had made the complaint and after it had offered to put things 
right in its final response. I also agree with comments already made by the investigator, that 
there is nothing unusual about someone paying by standing order and that it was up to 
AvantCredit to find a way to process this payment in good time, once it had accepted it. 
So, overall, I agree with the investigator, and I also uphold Mr Ds complaint. I think the 
proposed way to put things right suggested by the investigator is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances. So, it is now for AvantCredit to put things right as I describe below.
Putting things right
Based on the above, to put things right for Mr D I think AvantCredit should:
Pay an additional £100 by way of compensation for the stress and anxiety caused as 
a result of the prolonged failings in dealing with Mr Ds complaint. 
AvantCredit initially offered £50 to Mr D. So, with the additional amount, the total 
award is £150.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Ds complaint and direct AvantCredit of UK, LLC to put 
things right as I have described above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2022.
