K821x#15complaint
Miss B says DJS (UK) Limited, trading as Piggybank, lent to her irresponsibly.
background
I issued a provisional decision on 5 December 2018,  a copy  of which  is attached and forms 
part of this final decision. The full background to the complaint is set out in my provisional  
decision, so I wont  reiterate it here.
I explained why I was planning  to uphold this complaint in part and asked both parties to let 
me know if they had anything to add. 
Miss B said she accepted  the provisional  decision. Piggybank confirmed  it had received it 
and didnt send  me anything  else to consider.
my findings
Ive considered again all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive taken into account the law, good 
industry practice and any relevant regulations at the time.
As neither party sent me anything new to consider, I see no reason to depart from my 
provisional findings. So Im upholding this complaint  in part, for the same reasons  as given in 
my provisional decision.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. DJS (UK) Limited  must put things right by taking the steps  set 
out in my provisional  decision.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 8 February  2019.

Miss B says DJS (UK) Limited, trading as Piggybank, lent to her irresponsibly.

Piggybank approved 14 loans for Miss B between November 2016 and April 2018. Ive set out some 
of the information Piggybank  provided about the loans in the table below.

In its final response letter, Piggybank acknowledged that there  were  signs of Miss B being in financial  
difficulty from November 2017 and it offered to refund the interest and charges on loans 8-14. Our 
adjudicator considered the complaint and thought Piggybank wasnt wrong to approve loans 1-4. But 
he thought loans 5-7 shouldnt have been approved and that the business should refund  the interest 
and charges on these loans, in addition to the loans  Piggybank had already offered  to refund.
Piggybank said it didnt agree with the adjudicator  (although it didnt say why) and asked for an 
ombudsman to review the case. The complaint had been passed to me to decide.  
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive taken into account the law, good industry  practice and any 
relevant regulations at the time.
Relevant regulations and guidance include  the Financial  Conduct  Authoritys Consumer Credit 
sourcebook (CONC). CONC contains rules and guidance for lenders about responsible  lending. 
Among other things, CONC says lenders should carry out affordability checks  which are proportionate 
in the circumstances  of the loan. 
The regulations also say repayments  should  be sustainable  (i.e. repayable from the borrowers 
income or savings) and that lenders shouldnt allow a borrower to enter into consecutive credit 
agreements where it would be unsustainable to do so. CONC 6.7.21-22G notes that payday loans are 
primarily intended for people with short-term cash flow problems and arent  suitable for use over 
extended periods of time. 
With this in mind, Ive taken into account whether Piggybank carried out proportionate checks  before 
lending  and if I find it didnt, Ive gone on to consider what  proportionate checks would likely  have 
shown. 
Ref: DRN02509683loans 1-4
In short, I think Piggybank carried  out proportionate checks for these loans. It assessed 
Miss Bs credit history  and obtained information  about her income and expenditure and this 
information suggested these  loans  were affordable. And I dont  think Piggybank had reason to think  
Miss B was dependent on short-term loans or was otherwise in financial difficulty at the time she 
applied for loans 1-4. 
The repayments were  modest  relative to her income and she did not appear to have significant  
amounts of existing debt.  Her credit history does suggest she had defaulted on some accounts 
previously, but it does  not appear that these defaults were recent.  So I think it was reasonable for 
Piggybank to rely on what Miss B said about her income  and expenditure. And as this information 
suggested the loans  were affordable, Im not planning on upholding Miss Bs complaint about them.
loans 5-7
I dont think Piggybanks checks were proportionate for these  loans  Ill explain why.
Piggybank carried out the same checks on loans  5-7 as it did for loans  1-4; it asked Miss B about her 
income and expenditure  and obtained information  about her existing debts and credit history from a 
credit reference agency.
The results  of the search from the time of loan 5 seem to show Miss B had an outstanding short-term  
loan with a balance of £105.  The results for loan 6 are quite similar. For loan 7, the information 
changes. The credit  report shows  one unsecured  loan with a balance of £200 (most likely another  
payday loan) and a credit  card with a balance of £294.
On each application  Miss B declared an income  of £1,530 and total monthly expenditure  of £505. The 
total expenditure included £275 towards residential costs,  £40 for bills and £30 towards credit 
commitments. So Piggybank  calculated  that Miss Bs disposable income was about  £1,000 a month.
But I think Piggybank ought to have asked Miss B further questions. Loan 5 was Miss Bs fifth loan in 
about six months and was approved  just five days after she repaid  loan 4. And like all of her previous 
loans, Miss B said it was to meet an unexpected expense. This is the reason Miss B went  on to give 
for taking out 12 of her 14 loans  and Piggybank seems to have  accepted such a large number of 
unexpected expenses was unusual in its final response letter. It seems particularly unusual  given 
Miss B declared she had significant disposable  income  and limited monthly expenses.
Loans 6 and 7 were  also approved after only short breaks between  them and the previous  loans. So 
bearing in mind the lending pattern up to this point, I consider it wouldve been proportionate for 
Piggybank to gather  further information about Miss Bs expenditure.  The pattern of borrowing 
suggests Miss B wasnt able to repay Piggybank  while  also meeting  her other commitments.  So 
Piggybank shouldve asked  for a detailed  breakdown of her credit commitments  including any short-
term commitments, which  it might not find out about from a credit check. And I think  it shouldve asked 
Miss B to provide proof of her income  and at least some of her credit commitments and other regular  
expenditure.
what would proportionate checks have shown?
Ive considered the bank statements Miss B has provided  to get an idea of what Piggybank wouldve 
found out if it had asked for more information about Miss Bs credit commitments and proof of income 
and expenditure. I accept  this information  isnt necessarily what Piggybank wouldve seen. But I think 
the bank statements  will provide a reasonable factual record of Miss Bs circumstances at the time  
and so its reasonable for me to take this information into account.
Ref: DRN02509684loan 5
I think  it wouldve  seen that Miss Bs income was lower than she declared and was about £1,200 a 
month. I dont  think it wouldve thought  what Miss B said about  her regular expenditure was wrong  
the figure of around £500 seems plausible  based on the evidence Ive seen. So I think Piggybank 
wouldve found Miss Bs disposable income  was in the region of £700  before paying her short-term 
credit commitments.
Its difficult to say what Miss Bs existing  short-term credit commitments (at the time of the loan 
application) were. I can see that before applying  for loan 5, Miss B borrowed around £1,650 from a 
high-cost creditor  between  5 and 26 May 2017. But she repaid  about  half of this on the same day loan 
five was approved. The loan was from an instalment creditor and 
I dont know what the ongoing contractual payment wouldve been.  But I dont think  the contractual 
payment to the other creditor wouldve been so high that loan 5 wouldve  looked unaffordable. I say 
this because as the loan was from an instalment creditor,  its likely  the contractual payment  was only 
a fraction of the balance. As a result, Im not planning to uphold the complaint about loan 5.
loans 6 and 7
These were both instalment loans, with a term of five months and monthly repayments of £218 (loan 
6) and £278  (loan  7).
Had Piggybank continued  with proportionate checks, I think it wouldve seen Miss Bs income was still 
around £1,200 a month at the time of both loans. And, as I said for loan 5, I dont think Piggybank 
wouldve thought  what Miss B said about her regular expenditure was implausible   £500 would still 
have seemed about right.  So for loans  6 and 7, I think Piggybank wouldve thought Miss B had around 
£700 in disposable income  before  
short-term credit commitments.
As with loan 5, its difficult to say what Miss Bs existing  short-term  commitments were  when she 
made her applications for loans 6 and 7. She repaid  existing creditors large amounts on the same day 
or shortly before  applying for loans 6 and 7. And while I can see what  she actually paid her existing 
creditors, I think these were overpayments, rather than contractual commitments. I think  its more  
likely the contractual payments are what Piggybank wouldve discussed with Miss B. And because 
Miss Bs existing short-term commitments were  instalment loans, I think  the contractual  repayments 
were likely to be a lot lower  than what she chose  to actually pay.
Ive said that from proportionate checks Piggybank  wouldve thought Miss B had around £700 in 
disposable income.  Allowing  a reasonable sum for unexpected  expenses  of £100 would  mean  she 
had about £600 to put towards repaying short-term creditors. Shed  have £382 of this left over after 
making a payment for loan 6 and £322 left over after making a payment towards loan 7.
I cant  be completely  sure whether these amounts were enough to repay her existing 
short-term creditor. But on balance, I dont think the contractual payments for the existing loan(s)  
would have been higher  than £300.  So I think its likely proportionate checks  wouldve suggested  
loans 6 and 7 were affordable. Im therefore not planning to uphold  the complaint about loans 6 or 7.
loans 8-14
Piggybank agreed  to uphold the complaint about these loans because  it thought it shouldve  
recognised Miss B was in financial difficulty from about November 2017.
This services usual approach to redress in this scenario is that Piggybank should  refund the interest 
and charges Miss B paid on these loans, add 8% simple yearly interest to that and remove adverse  
information about these  loans from Miss Bs credit  history.
Ref: DRN02509685Piggybanks offer doesnt mention the 8% interest award, or the removal  of adverse information  from 
Miss Bs credit history.  So I plan to say Piggybank  should put things right in line with this services 
usual approach  I see no reason to depart from that approach here.
my provisional  decision
Im not planning to uphold the complaint about  loans 1-7. And I plan to say that for loans 
8-14, DJS (UK) Limited should:
refund the interest and charges Miss B paid on these loans
add 8% simple interest  per year to this refund
remove adverse  information  about  these  loans  from Miss Bs credit history
HM Revenue & Customs requires Piggybank  to take off tax from this interest. Piggybank must  give 
Miss B a certificate  showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
If after doing this Miss B still owes Piggybank something, Piggybank may offset the net redress 
against what  Miss B owes.
