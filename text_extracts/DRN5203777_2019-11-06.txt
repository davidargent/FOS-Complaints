Mr H says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) lent to him irresponsibly.

Our adjudicator considered the complaint and recommended  it be upheld  in part, in respect 
of Sunnys decision to approve loans 6 and 7. Sunny accepted  the adjudicators opinion and 
provided figures for redress. Mr H disputed some of the figures provided by Sunny and 
thought additional loans  shouldve  been upheld. As there was no agreement, the complaint 
was passed to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mr H could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
As the remaining area of disagreement is on Sunnys  decision to approve loans 1 to 5, Ill 
primarily focus on those loans in this decision. 
The loans were  repayable in monthly  instalments, the approximate  range of which were 
£155-£218 each month.
In looking at whether  Sunny carried out proportionate checks  for the first five loans, Ive 
taken into account  the size of the monthly  instalments and the information  Sunny obtained  
about Mr H. And as Ive outlined above, Id wouldnt expect to see quite such detailed checks 
(such as asking for copies  of bank statements) in the earlier  stages of a lending relationship.
With this in mind, I think it wouldve been reasonable for Sunny to rely more heavily on 
Ref: DRN52037772Mr Hs self-declared income and expenditure for the first five loans he borrowed. I dont think  
this sort of information  wouldve  likely  shown any of loans 1 to 5 were unaffordable.  Ive also 
looked at the credit  checks Sunny  carried out for these  loans  if there was any significantly 
concerning information within these I mightve expected Sunny to carry out more thorough 
checks. But the information  Ive seen doesnt lead me to think  it was unfair for Sunny to lend 
to Mr H.
For these reasons, I dont  think  Sunny acted unfairly by providing  loans 1 to 5. It has already 
accepted it needs to put things right for loans 6 and 7. But I can see Mr H has some 
concerns, so Ill explain what Sunny needs  to do. I make it clear that none of the figures in 
this decision should  be used for calculating  the redress.
Sunnys offer is to effectively treat Mr Hs last two loans as if they were interest free. So the 
most Mr H needs to pay towards  these loans is the amount he borrowed.
On 26 September  2019 Sunny told this service Mr H had paid £121.25 towards loan 6 and 
£55.75 towards  loan 7. If right, this would mean Mr H still owes Sunny the remaining 
principal due. Mr H, on the other  hand,  seems to be saying he has already made  payments  
of more than the principal  he borrowed   and that Sunny owes him a refund.
Its clear Mr H doesnt agree with the redress figures  provided by Sunny. But I dont find the 
screenshots he has provided  of Sunnys app particularly persuasive. They dont show  the 
actual amounts (i.e. a transaction history) Mr H has paid towards the loan  which is what Id 
really need to see to accept Sunny  was getting  the redress  wrong.
In any event, what Ill be directing Sunny to do is to cap Mr Hs liability  at the principal sums 
borrowed for loans  6 and 7. So if Mr H can provide Sunny with evidence that hes already 
repaid more than he borrowed for these loans, Id expect Sunny to take this into account.
putting things right
Sunny must  as it has offered  remove all interest  and charges applied  to loans 6 and 7. In 
other words, it should cap Mr Hs liability for loans 6 and 7 at the principal amounts 
borrowed. Sunny should also remove any adverse  information  it has recorded about  the 
loans.
Should Mr H be correct  in saying that hes already  repaid  more  than he has borrowed for 
loans 6 and 7, Sunny must  refund any amounts paid above  the principal, adding  8% simple 
interest per year, from the date the overpayments arose  until the date of settlement.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mr H a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that Sunnys offer to settle the complaint is fair. Elevate Credit 
International Limited must  put things right by taking the steps set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 December 2019.
