The complaint
Miss S complains that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) lent to her in an 
irresponsible manner.
What happened
Miss S has been assisted in making her complaint by a claims management company
(CMC). But, for ease, in this decision I will generally refer to all communication as having
been with, and from, Miss S herself.
Miss S was given a loan by 118 118 Money in August 2016. She borrowed £3000 and 
agreed to repay this over 24 months. Miss S has repaid her loan.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint in April 2022. Both parties have received a 
copy of that provisional decision, but for completeness I include an extract from the decision 
below. I said;
118 118 Money gathered some information from Miss S before it agreed to lend. It asked 
Miss S about her income and expenditure. It carried out an affordability check online with a 
third party. It also carried out a credit check. Those checks suggested Miss S had enough 
disposable income each month to afford the loan repayments. 
Miss S was entering into a fairly significant commitment with 118 118 Money. He was 
agreeing to make monthly repayments for a period of 2 years. So, I think it is right that 118 
118 Money wanted to gather, and independently check, some detailed information about 
Miss Ss financial circumstances before it agreed to lend to him. I think that the checks it did 
were sufficient to achieve that aim. I think 118 118 Moneys checks were proportionate. 
But simply performing proportionate checks isnt always enough. A lender also needs to
react appropriately to the information those checks show. Those results might sometimes 
lead a lender to undertake further enquiries into a consumers financial situation. Or, in some 
cases, the results might lead a lender to decline a loan application outright. So, Ive looked at 
what 118 118 Money gathered to see whether it needed to ask for more or whether it made 
a fair lending decision. 
I have looked at the credit search that 118 118 Money conducted. The search showed that 
Miss S had 6 active accounts listed. She held a bank account, 3 telecoms accounts, a credit 
card with a limit of £350 but no spend on it and a short-term loan. I can see that one of the 
telecoms accounts had been recorded as in default with a small balance to repay. I think 118 
118 Money ought to have had some concerns about this. But I can see that Miss S had an 
overall unsecured debt at that time of £554. She had told 118 118 Money that she was 
looking to obtain the loan for debt consolidation. So, she would have been able to repay all 
that she owed on her credit file, leaving only this loan and the repayment to pay each month.  
Miss S told 118 118 Money she was living at home and told 118 118 Money that her 
expenditure was £600. She also declared to it that her expenditure was £1400. I think when I 
consider how much Miss Ss monthly income was, and what she declared to 118 118 Money 
she had in essential spend, I think the credit she was looking to take out was easily 
affordable for her.
I think that the checks 118 118 Money performed were proportionate and didnt suggest that 
Miss S was facing any current problems in managing her finances. I think 118 118 Money 
was entitled to rely on what Miss S said about her finances, and her circumstances at the 
time. And that information suggested that he would be able to sustainably afford the 
repayments on the loan. So, I dont currently think 118 118 Money was wrong to give the 
loan to Miss S.
I asked both parties to let me have any comments, or additional evidence, in response 
to my provisional decision. Miss S and 118 118 Money did not respond.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Neither party has responded, so I dont see any reason to depart from my findings within 
my provisional decision. With that being the case, I do not uphold Miss Ss complaint.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Miss Ss complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 18 June 2022.
