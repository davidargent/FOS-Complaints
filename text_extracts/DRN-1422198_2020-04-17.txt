The complaint
Mr O says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent 
to him. Mr O has told us he had a poor credit rating score and shouldnt have been lent to. 
He got into a cycle of debt and needed to re-borrow for essential bills. He is still in debt as a 
result of the borrowing.
What happened
This complaint is about 31 short-term loans Sunny provided to Mr O between 
September 2015 and October 2017. Mr Os borrowing history is as follows:

When Mr O complained to Sunny it offered to uphold his complaint from loan 25 onwards but 
he wasnt happy with the offer, so brought his complaint to us.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mr Os complaint and thought the loans from loan four 
onwards shouldnt have been given. They also thought the information about borrowing from 
loan six onwards was adverse for Mr O so should be removed from his credit file.
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint from loan 20. We put this to Mr O but 
he didnt accept. 
Another of our adjudicators reviewed the case and thought that it was only necessary for all 
information to be removed from Mr Os credit file from loan nine onwards. Both parties to the 
complaint have been made aware of this slight amendment.As the complaint remains unresolved it has been passed to me for decision in my role as 
ombudsman. and the complaint was passed to me.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Mr O could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mr O could sustainably repay his loans  not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments; as well as without having to borrow to meet 
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre 
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mr O didnt comment on the adjudicators opinion that loans one to three shouldnt be 
upheld. Because of this, I dont think there is any ongoing disagreement about these loans. 
So, I wont be making a decision about this lending. But the loans were part of the borrowing 
relationship Mr O had with Sunny. So, it is something I will take into account when 
considering the other loans he took. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mr Os complaint. After doing so, Ive decided to uphold 
Mr Os complaint in part. Ill explain why. Like the adjudicator, I think when Mr O asked for further borrowing at loan four, Sunny 
should have reconsidered whether it was reasonable to lend to him again. I think his 
borrowing behaviour could be a suggestion that he was having problems managing his 
money and Sunny should have tried to find out more about his financial situation.
At the loan four application it would be Mr Os fourth borrowing in two months and all for the 
same amount. And he was re-borrowing very quickly  the same day in some instances 
after repaying the previous loan which would suggest Mr O was having problems managing 
his money and was borrowing more to repay current borrowing. So, it looks as though the 
borrowing was already becoming unsustainable. 
Mr O was repaying his loans well before the agreed repayment dates. I appreciate this may 
have saved him interest charges, but I think its equally an indication that Mr O wasnt 
managing his finances. And when he repaid one loan, he replaced it with another one and 
for the same amount. I would question why someone would repay one debt just to replace it 
with another. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mr O, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mr Os case, and like the second adjudicator, I think 
that this point was reached by loan nine. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mr O was not managing to repay his loans 
sustainably. Mr O had taken out nine loans within six months. So Sunny ought to 
have realised it was more likely than not Mr O was having to borrow further to cover 
the hole repaying his previous loan was leaving in his finances and that Mr Os 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Mr Os first loan was for £300 and loan nine was for the same amount.  At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that Mr O was not likely borrowing to meet a temporary 
shortfall in his income but to meet an ongoing need. And this seems likely as it was 
one of Mr Os complaint points.
Mr O was continually provided with a new loan within days or weeks of settling a 
previous one. 
Mr O wasnt making any real inroads to the amount he owed Sunny. Loan 31 was 
taken out 25 months after Mr Os first. Mr O had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to Sunny over an extended period.
 
I think that Mr O lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan nine 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mr Os indebtedness by allowing him 
to take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time.
the number of loans and the length of time over which Mr O borrowed was likely to 
have had negative implications on Mr Os ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept him in the market for these high-cost loans.
 
So, like the adjudicator Im also upholding the complaint about loans four to 31 and Sunny 
should put things right.
 Putting things right refund all interest and charges Mr O paid on loans four to 31;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about four to eight from Mr Os credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan nine onwards means any information recorded 
about them is adverse. So, all entries about loans nine to 31 should be removed from 
Mr Os credit file.
 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr O a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im partially upholding Mr Os complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr O to accept or 
reject my decision before 17 May 2020.
