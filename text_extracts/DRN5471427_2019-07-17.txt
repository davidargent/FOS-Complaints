Miss B says that at the time of the loans she was borrowing most months and the amount 
tended to go up. She says the loans trapped her in a spiral  of debt with the loan repayments 
taking so much of her income that she had to borrow again to be able to afford her other 
debts and living costs.  She believes that adequate  checks werent carried  out before the 
loans were provided and that her credit  file showed  the financial difficulties she was 
experiencing.
Miss B says the stress of the loans affected  her health.
QuickQuid raised a concern regarding jurisdiction which as been  dealt  within a separate 
decision. In regard to loans 12 to 26 is says that Miss B had a good repayment history and 
that there  were breaks in her borrowing. It says that when she told it about her financial 
hardship it acted positively and sympathetically towards her. 
Ref: DRN54714272Having considered all the loans, our adjudicator said she didnt have enough evidence to say 
it was unfair  that the first two loans were provided. But she thought loans three  to 26 
shouldnt have been lent.
QuickQuid didnt accept  our adjudicators view. It noted that the last loan was a line of credit 
and not a payday loan.  It said that Miss B notified  it about her financial difficulties after the 
second withdrawal  under this facility at which point  the interest was halted and a payment 
plan set up. 
QuickQuid said that the amounts Miss B borrowed varied and were low compared to her 
monthly income and that its checks showed the loans were  affordable.  
As a resolution hasnt  been agreed, this complaint  has been  passed to me, an ombudsman, 
to issue a decision.
my findings
I've considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  We've  set out our general approach to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website.
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure that 
Miss B could repay  the loans in a sustainable manner. These  checks  could take into account 
a number of different things, such as how much was being lent the repayment amounts  and 
the consumer's  income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for a consumer. These  factors  
include:
the lower  a customer's income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet  a 
higher repayment  from a particular  level of income);
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time during 
which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  may 
signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether Miss B could sustainably repay her loans - not just whether the loan payments were 
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
At that time of the loans the relevant guidance  was provided by the Office  of Fair trading 
(OFT). In its March  2010 guide  concerning  irresponsible lending it set out the need to make 
a reasonable assessment of whether a borrower can afford to meet  repayments in a 
sustainable manner.  This refers to issues such as being able to the make  the repayments  
Ref: DRN54714273without undue difficulties  throughout the life of the agreement and without having to realise 
security or assets. It then further sets out that without  undue difficulty  means without having 
to borrow further. 
Therefore I have considered whether QuickQuid did enough to ensure that lending to Miss B 
was sustainable.  Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information 
provided in this context  and what  this all means  for Miss Bs complaint.
QuickQuid has mentioned breaks  in Miss Bs borrowing. While I note the comments, having 
looked at when the loans  were provided,  I dont think it would have been reasonable for 
QuickQuid to conclude  these were any indication that Miss Bs finances had moved  on from 
whatever situation  had required  her previous loans. Therefore I have considered  all of the 
loans as part of the same lending chain.
Our adjudicator said that she didnt have enough evidence  to say the first two loans 
shouldnt have been provided and I agree  with this.
Loan three was taken  out a few days after loan two was repaid. Although this was for a lower  
amount, by this time Miss B was showing signs that she was struggling financially. She had 
incurred late payment fees on her second  loan and this had been  repaid more than a month 
later than initially scheduled. Given this I think QuickQuid should have been concerned that 
lending to her was not sustainably affordable.
By loan four, Miss Bs overall  pattern of borrowing suggested she had become persistently 
reliant on short term loans. Miss B had taken out four loans in around eight months with 
each loan being taken out shortly after a previous loan had been repaid. The loan amounts 
did vary but there was no significant  reduction  in the loans. Miss B continued  to borrow and 
her loan amounts  didnt  suggest that she was reducing her overall  borrowing. I think  that 
from loan four, QuickQuid  should  have realised that Miss B was dependent  on short term 
loans and that the lending  was unsustainable.
Overall, I think that Miss B lost out because QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from 
loan three  onwards. These loans had the effect  of unfairly prolonging Miss B's indebtedness 
by allowing her to take expensive  credit  intended  for short  term use over an extended period 
of time. The sheer number of loans was likely to have had negative implications on Miss B's 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost loans
Ref: DRN54714274my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint in regard to loans  three to 26. CashEuroNet  
UK LLC (trading as QuickQuid)  should:
refund  all interest and charges Miss B paid on the loans from 3 to 26
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on all refunds from the date of payment to the date 
of settlement*;
remove any negative information  about loan three from Miss Bs credit file;
the number  of loans taken from loans  four to 26 means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans four to 26 should be removed from 
Miss Bs credit file;
* HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid  to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid  
must give Miss B a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 17 August 2019.
