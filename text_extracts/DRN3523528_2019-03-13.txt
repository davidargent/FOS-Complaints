K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc blocked  his bank account and hasnt 
satisfactorily explained why it did so. He says this caused him distress  and inconvenience 
because he wasnt able to access his funds. And he wants NatWest  to compensate  him.
background
Mr M had a current account with NatWest.
In June 2018, NatWest  decided  to block Mr Ms account. This meant he didnt have access  
to the money  in his account. At the time the block was applied, Mr M was travelling overseas 
with his family. He says the block caused him a great  deal of stress and inconvenience 
because he didnt have  access to the money in his account, which he was relying upon to 
fund his trip. 
On 10 July 2018, NatWest removed the block on Mr Ms account. On 20 July 2018,  NatWest 
wrote to Mr M to let him know it had decided to close his account. NatWest  gave Mr M 60 
days notice and told him he needed  to make alternative banking  arrangements. 
Mr M says NatWest  hasnt properly explained the reasons why it decided to block his 
account. Hes said because his account was blocked he had to use his credit  card to pay for 
everyday expenses. And he had to cut short his trip to come back  to the UK to try and sort 
things out. He says this caused him a great  deal of stress and upset.  And he wants  NatWest  
to compensate him for the cost of flights back to the UK.  
Mr M complained to NatWest. It said its not obliged to enter  into any discussion  with Mr M to 
explain its decision to block his account.  Unhappy with this response Mr M brought  his 
complaint to this service.
Our investigator said she was satisfied  NatWest had followed its legal and regulatory 
obligations. So she didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr M disagreed. Hes still upset that 
NatWest blocked  his account  without  explanation.  He says this caused  him a great deal of 
upset and inconvenience. He wants NatWest to provide a full explanation and pay him 
compensation for the trouble NatWest caused  by blocking his account.  As no agreement  
could be reached  the complaint has come to me to decide.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
account block
Having looked  at the evidence, Im satisfied that NatWest acted in line with its legal and 
regulatory obligations when it blocked Mr Ms account. I accept that this caused Mr M 
difficulty in particular because he was overseas at the time he realised his account was 
blocked. And I can understand that hes frustrated that he hasnt been given a proper 
explanation. 
Ref: DRN35235282Mr M made several  phone calls to the bank to try and find out what was happening with his 
account. He explained to NatWest that he was overseas so he needed access  to his 
account. Mr M says he had to return to the UK at great expense to gain access to his 
account. And he wants NatWest to compensate  him for the cost of his travel  expenses.  And 
the distress caused  by having to cut his trip short.  
Ive listened to the calls Mr M had with NatWest. During the calls Mr M asked NatWest what 
was happening.  And why he couldnt  access his account. Its clear from listening to the calls 
that Mr M was quite frustrated. I can understand why. He was overseas with his family and 
running out of money to finance  his trip. And he wasnt being given much information.  But 
NatWest doesnt  have to provide this information  to him. So I cant  say the bank did anything 
wrong by not giving this to him.
During one of Mr Ms telephone calls with NatWest, on 6 July 2018, the advisor  suggested 
Mr M could  go into a branch with some identification  to try and sort things  out. But NatWest 
didnt tell Mr M he had to come back to the UK. That was a decision Mr M took for himself.  
Ive also noted  that during the same call Mr M told NatWest he was returning  to the UK the 
following week anyway. And hed be able to take the opportunity to go into a branch as 
suggested. So it seems  Mr M was already planning  on coming back to the UK.
Having looked  at whats happened  in this particular case, I can see no basis on which 
I might  make  an award  against NatWest given that I dont think it failed to properly follow  its 
own procedures when  it blocked Mr Ms account. Im also satisfied that NatWest was acting 
in line with its legal and regulatory  obligations when it blocked Mr Ms account. So Im not 
going to ask NatWest  to compensate him for any inconvenience  this may have caused him.
account closure
A bank  is entitled  to close an account with a customer just as a customer may close  an 
account with a bank. But before a bank closes an account, it must do so in a way, which 
complies with the terms and conditions of the account.
The terms and conditions  of the account  which both NatWest and Mr M had to comply with 
say that it could close the account by giving him 60 days notice. NatWest has done this. So 
its entitled to close  the accounts as it seems its already done. 
Mr Ms pointed  out that he has been  a NatWest customer for many years  and says he hasnt 
done anything  wrong. But the bank can make commercial decisions about who it offers  
banking services to. They  cannot unfairly  discriminate  against a customer. But they can say 
they no longer  wish to do business with individuals. Thats because theyve got the 
commercial freedom to decide who they want to contract with. And Im satisfied  that NatWest  
has exercised its commercial decision legitimately when it decided to close Mr Ms account.  
So I cannot fairly and reasonably say its done anything  wrong.
In summary,  I recognise how strongly Mr M feels about whats happened, and I dont doubt 
this was a difficult  time for him. I know my decision will come  as a great frustration and 
disappointment to him. But overall, based on the evidence Ive seen, I cant say NatWest 
have acted unreasonably or treated Mr M unfairly.  So I wont  be asking them  to do anything.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I dont uphold this complaint.
Ref: DRN35235283Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 13 April 2019.
