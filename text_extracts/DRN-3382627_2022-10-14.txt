The complaint
Miss B complains that MetLife Europe d.a.c.{MetLife} mis-sold a term assurance policy to 
her in 2013 and when she was furloughed in 2020 and couldnt afford the premiums, MetLife 
cancelled the policy. 
What happened
Miss B met with MetLife in 2012 and 2013. In 2012 Miss B and her partner were sold a joint 
life accident benefit policy. A year later, MetLife met with Miss B and her partner again and 
recommended Miss B take out a level term assurance policy that would pay £25,000 if she 
died. 
In August 2020 the direct debit for the term assurance was cancelled and the policy was 
cancelled later the same year. Miss B says she couldnt afford the premium at the time as 
shed been furloughed. Around this time Miss B, represented by her partner, attempted to 
make a claim on the term assurance policy as she believed it provided sickness and 
unemployment benefits. The policy didnt provide this cover and Miss B, represented by her 
partner, complained to MetLife that the policy had been mis-sold and that MetLife didnt tell 
her when the policy had been cancelled.
MetLife responded to say that at the meeting in 2013 Miss B agreed a need for life cover 
over 20 years and that as she had no earned income at that time, no need for income 
protection was agreed. Although Miss B agreed a need for up to £200,000 of life cover, it 
was agreed that the benefit should be linked to what she could afford to pay, and that this 
resulted in an application for £25,000 life cover. MetLife confirmed the direct debit was 
cancelled in August 2020, and that theyd written to Miss B to tell her the policy would be 
cancelled if she didnt re-instate the direct debit and pay the backdated premiums. MetLife 
didnt uphold Miss Bs complaints.
Miss B wasnt happy with the final response from MetLife and brought her complaint to the 
Financial Ombudsman Service. Miss B is represented by her partner in her complaint and 
one of our Investigators looked into things. The Investigator thought MetLife hadnt done 
anything significantly wrong. Miss Bs representative didnt agree and asked that an 
Ombudsman decides the complaint and it has now been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I understand Miss will be disappointed, but for very much the same reasons as our 
Investigator, Ive decided its unlikely the level term assurance was mis-sold, and that 
MetLife took reasonable steps to explain to Miss B that the policy would be cancelled if she 
couldnt maintain the premiums. In respect of the claim Miss B says she made on the policy 
for unemployment benefit, Ive not seen any evidence this happened. Regardless of this, Ive 
decided this benefit wasnt included in this particular policy. 
I understand Miss B and her partner have other plans with MetLife and that the Financial 
Ombudsman Service is considering these under a separate complaint. So, my decision will 
only deal with the level term assurance policy Miss B took out in 2013. And, as this sale took 
place in 2013, Ive reviewed the application form and needs analysis signed by Miss B in 
May 2013.
Mis-sale of the level term assurance policy
The needs analysis Miss B signed indicated that shes agreed several areas of need; life 
cover (non-mortgage related), critical illness cover and accident protection. Life cover was 
noted as the most important need at the time, and this doesnt seem unreasonable in the 
circumstances. Miss B had no dependent children at the time but did indicate her partner 
was a dependent and vice-versa. Although there is little evidence to say why the sum of 
£25,000 was recommended, it seems likely that this would have been driven by cost. Miss B 
wasnt employed at the time and her partner had agreed to pay the premiums for the cover. 
Miss B had other agreed needs, but the life cover was her main priority at the time. It was 
recorded she had a budget of £20 per month and its unlikely she would have been able to 
afford additional critical illness cover at the time, which was the second priority she identified. 
Ive also seen that Miss B already had £150,000 of accidental death cover in place, and 
although there was a shortfall noted, this was a lower priority for her at the time. The term 
assurance policy was for 20 years, which would have provided cover for Miss B until she 
reached the age of 69. I havent seen any particular debt or event that Miss B wanted the 
cover for, but I consider its likely the term of the policy was agreed with Miss B at the time.
As I consider there was likely a need for the cover recommended and that it was likely 
affordable, Ive also looked at whether it was reasonable for Miss B to believe this policy paid 
out a sum assured if she was unable to work, or became unemployed. I consider its more 
likely than not Miss B would have been aware the term assurance policy only paid out if she 
died. I say this because MetLife has provided a copy of a welcome letter it sent to Miss B on 
12 June 2013, together with a copy of the policy schedule. Of course, I cant be certain what 
MetLife told Miss B at the time of the sale, or that Miss B received the documents sent to her 
after the sale, but I do consider that by sending these documents MetLife took reasonable 
steps to ensure Miss B understood what benefits the policy provided. It was reasonably clear 
from these documents the policy only paid out if Miss B died or she was diagnosed with a 
terminal illness and death was expected to occur during the term of the policy. 
So, taking all this information into account, I dont consider the term assurance was mis-sold, 
or that its likely MetLife told Miss B the policy would cover her for unemployment or 
sickness. And, regardless of this, Ive not seen any evidence Miss B actually made a claim 
for any unemployment benefit on this policy.
Cancellation of the policy
In August 2020, the direct debit for the life assurance policy was cancelled. Miss B says this 
is because she was furloughed. MetLife wrote to Miss B on 12 August 2020 and explained 
the policy was at risk of being cancelled if the premiums werent paid. MetLife included a 
new direct debit.
The policy terms made it clear that premiums are to paid monthly in advance, and there was 
a short 30-day grace period for outstanding premiums to be paid. If premiums are not paid 
within 30 days, then the policy can be cancelled. I consider the terms and conditions of the 
policy in this regard are clear. Putting it quite simply, MetLife told Miss B that if she missed 
any further premiums and didnt catch up the payments the policy would be cancelled, and 
the cover would stop. MetLife sent a further letter in September reminding Miss B that f she didnt pay the 
premiums the policy would be cancelled. And, in November MetLife wrote to Miss B to tell 
her the policy had been cancelled. Each letter invited Miss B to contact MetLife to discuss 
the options open to her, including re-starting the policy after it had been cancelled. Miss B 
and MetLife have been unable to provide any evidence that she contacted MetLife about the 
policy, so I dont consider it was unfair or unreasonable for MetLife to cancel the policy. Ive 
noted that Miss Bs partner did contact MetLife, but as her partner wasnt the policyholder 
MetLife was unable to provide any policy information. Ive considered this, but Im satisfied 
MetLife wrote to Miss B and its reasonable that she would have been aware the policy was 
in danger of being cancelled, and she could have given MetLife authority for her partner to 
speak with it on her behalf to help her resolve the matter. But theres no evidence that 
happened.
Miss B and her partner, who paid the premium, will likely have been impacted by a drop in 
income during the furlough period. So, Ive considered what actions MetLife took and 
whether it treated Miss B fairly and with some understanding of her circumstances. In my 
opinion, the letters from MetLife show that it attempted to contact Miss B several times so 
that it could provide advice on how the benefits of the policy could be maintained, and also 
how the policy could be re-started once it had been cancelled. I consider this shows that 
MetLife took reasonable steps to try and support Miss B at the time. And because Miss B 
didnt contact MetLife to arrange for payments to be restored, or to re-start the policy, I dont 
consider MetLife acted unfairly or unreasonably in cancelling the policy.
My final decision
For the reasons provided above, Ive decided not to uphold Miss Bs complaint about MetLife 
Europe d.a.c.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss B to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 November 2022.
