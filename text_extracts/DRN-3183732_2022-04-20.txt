The complaint
A partnership, which Ill refer to as P, is unhappy with the service it received from National 
Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) in regard to events surrounding the transferral of its 
business relationship with NatWest to NatWests Global Restructuring Group (GRG)
What happened
P, a property development business, had loans with NatWest that were originally set to 
expire on 1 April 2008. Because of planning and project development issues, NatWest 
agreed to extend the expiry date of the loans on several occasions, to 1 July 2008, 15 
February 2009, and 4 April 2009 respectively.
By April 2009, NatWest had concerns over Ps ongoing ability to service the loans and felt 
that the situation was serious enough to transfer Ps business relationship first to a 
Specialised Relationship Manager and then, in August 2009, to its GRG.
Following this, both P and NatWest proposed options as to how to move the business 
relationship forwards, but without consensus, and in September 2009 NatWest issued a 
Reservation of Rights letter giving P one month to refinance its debt elsewhere or the 
relationship would be passed to NatWests recoveries team. In December 2010, NatWest 
appointed receivers and Ps properties were sold.
P wasnt happy about this, so it raised a complaint. NatWest felt it had managed Ps 
business relationship fairly, and so it didnt uphold Ps complaint. P then took the complaint 
to an Independent third Party (ITP), but the ITP also didnt feel that NatWest had acted 
unreasonably in how it had managed its business relationship with P, and so it also didnt 
uphold Ps complaint.
P remained dissatisfied, so it referred its complaint to this service. One of our investigators 
looked at this complaint. They noted that some aspects of Ps complaint were outside the 
remit of what this service can consider. Additionally, our investigator felt that regarding the 
aspects of Ps complaint that this service could consider, that NatWest hadnt acted unfairly 
or unreasonably towards P. Because of this, our investigator didnt uphold Ps complaint.
P wasnt happy with the view of its complaint put forwards by our investigator, so the matter 
was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There are several aspects to Ps complaint, not all of which fall within the remit of what this 
service is allowed to consider. This remit is set out in the Dispute Resolution (DISP) section 
of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Handbook, which lists the rules by which this 
service must abide. 
One of the relevant rules here is DISP 2.8.2, which states:
The ombudsman cannot consider a complaint if the complainant refers it to the 
Financial Ombudsman Service:
(1) more than six months after the date on which the respondent sent the 
complainant its final response, redress determination or summary resolution 
communication; unless
(3) in the view of the Ombudsman, the failure to comply with the time limits was as 
a result of exceptional circumstances
One aspect of Ps complaint relates to the actions of a Monitoring Surveyor appointed by 
NatWest. However, P first complained to NatWest about this aspect of its complaint in 2011, 
and NatWest issued a final response which addressed this aspect of Ps complaint in July 
2011. That final response included that P had six months from the date of that response to 
refer this aspect of its complaint to this service, if P wished to do so.
But P didnt refer this aspect of its complaint to this service until 2019, which was more six 
months after the final response letter issued by NatWest in 2011. As a result, Im satisfied 
that this aspect of Ps complaint isnt one which this service can consider.
I realise that this will be of disappointment to P and Ive considered the points that P has 
raised with our investigator about this matter. But I feel that the rules here are clear, and 
while NatWest have agreed to waive some of the rules present in DISP in regard to GRG 
complaints, this doesnt include the six-month rule, which as such remains applicable here. 
Additionally, I dont feel that any exceptional circumstances apply in this instance.
Another aspect of Ps complaint is that its unhappy with how NatWest have handled its 
complaint to them. However, the FCA Handbook limits the types of complaint that this 
service (the Financial Ombudsman Service) can consider to being those: 
about the provision of, or failure to provide, a financial service... 
While I can appreciate that P is unhappy with how NatWest have handled its complaint, the 
handling of complaints isnt a financial service, and as such this isnt an aspect of Ps 
complaint that this service is allowed to consider. Accordingly, I wont be referring to either of 
these aspects of Ps complaint further.
The aspects of Ps complaint which I am satisfied this service can consider are as follows:
The rates of interest and administration and arrangement fees were unreasonable.
NatWest unreasonably demanded repayment of its loan facilities and unreasonably 
instructed receivers to sell the property portfolio.
The Reservation of Rights letter only gave P one month to refinance its debt which 
was unreasonable.
P offered to hand over the part-completed site to NatWest, but this offer was refused
and NatWest made P complete the development only for NatWest to then put P into 
receivership.
NatWest changed key legal terms of its 2008 loan agreement, including events of 
default, without specifically pointing out these changes but instead relied on P taking independent legal advice. P say the bank knew that no legal advice had been sought 
and that it was asked to sign documents in inappropriate circumstances such as on 
the building site.
Terms were agreed verbally with NatWest at a meeting on 19 May 2010 but the 
confirmatory letter from NatWest on 1 June 2010, and another letter four months 
later, included other terms not previously agreed with or by P.
P was not in default as monthly repayments of Â£10,000 continued to be made and 
were being made when the receivers were appointed.
The overdraft was for purposes not associated with the loan and an overdraft wasnt 
appropriate for what it was used for and should have been a loan instead. Also, the
purpose behind rolling the overdraft up into a loan was so that the overdraft was 
secured on the property meant for the loan.
I will now consider each of these points in turn.
The rates of interest and administration and arrangement fees were unreasonable
P held three loans and an overdraft. Regarding the three loans, NatWest charged 
arrangement fees when the loans were refinanced upon the expiry of previous loans. Such 
arrangement fees are charged in consideration of the work done by the bank in arranging 
and committing to the loans and are a common feature of business loans such as these. As 
such, I dont consider the charging of this type of fee to have been unreasonable.
Its also notable that the amount of each arrangement fee charged by NatWest 
corresponded to approximately 2% of the overall loan facility amount. This doesnt seem 
unreasonable to me, and I note that its typical of arrangement fee charge amounts at the 
time in question.
Additionally, I also dont feel that the rates of interest charged on the loans  base rate 
+1.96% for one of the loans and base rate +3.80% for the other two loans  are unfairly 
large for the type of borrowing, and Ive seen nothing to suggest that these rates of interest 
were unreasonably high in relation to the rates of interest that NatWest was charging to 
similar customers at that time.
In regard to the overdraft, while the overdraft amount varied over time it appears that the 
amount of fee charged for arranging additional overdraft was between 0.75% and 1%. Again, 
this doesnt appear unreasonable to me, and I also dont feel that the rate of interest charged 
by NatWest on the overdraft was unfair or notably higher that rates of interest on similar 
comparable overdrafts offered either by NatWest or other credit providers at that time.
P has also stated that it feels it should have been able to pay these fees during the lifetime 
of the credit facilities, rather than the fees being rolled up to the end. But the rolling of fees 
such as this to the end of the credit term is a common feature of property development 
lending such as this, and its done on the basis that the property developer would have an 
influx of cash at the end of the development, when the properties are sold, and would have a 
need to direct as much cash as possible into the property while the development process is 
ongoing. 
As such, I dont feel that NatWest have acted unfairly or unreasonably by structuring the 
borrowing as they did here, and it follows that I wont be upholding these aspects of Ps 
complaint. NatWest unreasonably demanded repayment of its loan facilities and unreasonably 
instructed receivers to sell the property portfolio
While I can appreciate Ps strength of feeling here, it must be remembered that Ps loans 
had expired and had not been repaid as of several extended expiry dates. That these loans 
werent repaid by the designated expiry date means that the loans were in default.
Given that the loans were in default, that P hadnt been able to arrange alternative 
refinancing, and that NatWest had been informed that P had significant debts elsewhere, it 
doesnt seem unreasonable to me that NatWest would have had concerns about the 
recoverability of its lending to P.
Furthermore, it also doesnt seem unreasonable or unfair to me that NatWest, when faced 
with these circumstances, would demand repayment of its lending to P and subsequently 
appoint receivers to sell the properties charged as security to NatWest when such 
repayment wasnt forthcoming. Accordingly, it follows that I wont be upholding this aspect of 
Ps complaint.
The Reservation of Rights letter only gave the partnership a month to refinance its debt 
which was unreasonable
While its correct that the Reservation of rights letter issued by NatWest in September 2009 
did give the partnership a period of only one month in which to arrange refinancing, this 
deadline was later extended by NatWest until January 2010. 
Additionally, when P werent able to arrange refinancing by this extended deadline, NatWest 
didnt immediately appoint receivers, but waited until nearly a year later  in December 2010 
 to do so. Additionally, this was despite NatWest being informed that a final charging order 
had been made by another creditor for a debt of approximately Â£311,000, and also being 
made aware of bankruptcy notices filed against members of P. 
As such, while the Reservation of Rights letter did give what appears to be a unreasonably 
short period of time for P to have arranged refinancing, NatWest didnt actually take any 
action consequential to P not arranging such refinancing until 14 months after the original 
deadline date. 
Because of this, I dont feel that NatWest have acted unfairly or unreasonably towards P 
here, and it follows that I wont be upholding this aspect of Ps complaint.
P offered to hand over the part-completed site to NatWest, but NatWest refused and made P 
complete the development only for NatWest to then put P into receivership
In April 2009, the construction company working for P went into liquidation, with 25% of the 
project completed. At this point P didnt have the funds to complete the development 
because most of the project funds had already been paid to the now liquidated construction 
company. 
P maintain that NatWest should have defaulted the credit facilities at this time, rather than 
waiting until the development was complete  which was only completed as a result of P 
acquiring funds from other sources  by which time the market conditions had changed 
significantly for the worse meaning that the property sales that were subsequently enforced 
by NatWest were undertaken at a time when the value realised from those sales was 
unusually low.Once again, I can appreciate Ps strength of feeling here. But the decision as to when to 
default the credit facilities and to subsequently appoint receivers to sell the properties was 
one which it was at the discretion of NatWest to make. And while the benefit of hindsight 
may show that the timing of these decisions was unfortunate from the perspective of P, I 
havent seen anything to suggest that NatWest acted unreasonably in light of the 
circumstances it was faced with at that time.
For instance, it seems evidence from the information available to me that NatWest wanted to 
give P more time to compete the development because NatWest felt that this provided the 
best chance for P to be able to repay the borrowing. This doesnt seem unreasonable to me, 
and its difficult not to conclude that NatWest would have considered it to be in both Ps and 
NatWests interests for the development to be finished by P as it would allow the potential 
saleable value of the development to be as high as possible.
Additionally, I also havent seen any evidence to suggest that NatWest acted deliberately so 
as to delay the sale of the properties until a time when the sale prices would be low. Indeed, 
given that NatWest appointed the receivers to sell the properties in order to recover its 
lending to P, it would seem illogical and counter-productive for NatWest to have employed 
such a strategy. Accordingly, in consideration of all the above, I wont be upholding this 
aspect of Ps complaint.
NatWest changed key legal terms of its 2008 loan agreement, including events of default,
without specifically pointing out these changes to P but instead relied on P taking legal 
advice. P say that NatWest knew that no legal advice had been sought and that it was asked 
to sign documents in inappropriate circumstances, such as on the building site
P has provided the indicative terms on which NatWest was willing to lend. Unfortunately, a 
copy of the finalised loan agreement isnt available. This means that it isnt possible to 
directly compare the indicative terms with the finalised agreement.
However, its notable that the indicative terms include the following:
These terms are indicative and may be subject to further revision prior or post a final 
credit approval and any financial/legal due diligence and we would draw your 
attention to the Important Notice contained on the previous page of this document.
And that the Important Notice referred to in the quotation above included:
 these indicative terms and conditions do not represent a binding offer to provide 
finance
As such, it seems clear that the indicative terms werent in themselves a binding agreement 
and that it was both possible and permitted for the indicative terms to be revised before the 
final terms were agreed and signed. 
Additionally, the terms included the opening statement that P should take legal advice before 
signing the terms. And it must be noted that in a general sense its widely considered to be 
good practice to obtain legal advice before committing to any complex financial agreement.
P have explained that one of its members isnt familiar with the UK legal environment and 
didnt understand the terms that NatWest were changing. But this only furthers my conviction 
that that member of P should have ensured that they took legal advice on the terms before 
signing them and agreeing to them.P have further stated that its members were obliged to sign the final terms without having the 
opportunity to review them in depth for changes to the indicative terms or to have them 
reviewed by a legal advisor, including that P were asked to sign documents in unreasonable 
locations such as on site at the development and that regardless of the disclaimer that legal 
advice should be sought NatWest were aware that no such advice had been obtained by P.
While I can appreciate Ps position here, Im unable to comment on what was or wasnt said 
during any face to face meetings that may have taken place as no recordings or transcripts 
from such meetings have been provided to this service. And while it was NatWests 
responsibility to signpost P towards taking legal advice  which Im satisfied that NatWest did 
 it wasnt NatWests responsibility to ensure that such advice was taken. This was the 
responsibility of P, if it decided that it wanted to follow NatWests suggestion in this regard, 
although P was entitled to sign the agreement without taking legal advice if it chose to do so.
Finally, P have drawn particular attention to the fact that NatWest changed the terms as they 
related to defaults and note that in the indicative terms repayment of the loans would only be 
required when the development was complete. P therefore suggest that it wasnt fair for 
NatWest to default the borrowing when it did, at a time when the development wasnt 
completed.
But the loans all had dates of expiry, initially being April 2008 but eventually being extended 
until April 2009. The loans werent repaid in April 2009, when the loan terms expired, and as 
such the loans were in default at that point, regardless of the state of the development at that 
time. As such, I dont feel that it was unfair for NatWest to have defaulted the borrowing 
when it did.
Ultimately, I find it difficult to conclude anything other than that it was incumbent on P, 
regardless of the circumstances, to have not signed any agreement until they were certain 
that they were happy to abide by the terms of the agreement which they were signing. And 
given that Im satisfied, as explained above, that NatWest were entitled to revise the terms of 
the indicative agreement, and given that I havent seen anything in the documents provided 
to this service which would indicate any deliberate act of coercion on NatWests behalf here, 
it follows that I wont be upholding this aspect of Ps complaint.
Terms were agreed verbally with NatWest at a meeting on 19 May 2010 but the confirmatory 
letter from NatWest dated 1 June 2010, and another four months later, included other terms 
not previously agreed with P
P maintain that there were differences in a draft Repayment Terms letter dated 25 October 
2010 in relation to an earlier Repayment Terms letter dated 20 June 2010 and which had 
been signed by both P and NatWest following the meeting that took place on 19 May 2010.
There is no recording or transcript of the 19 May 2010 meeting, which means that my 
understanding of what took place at that meeting is limited to any records or communications 
that refer to that meeting. To this effect, I note an email sent by NatWest to P following the 
meeting which stated:
I write further to our meeting on 19 May 2010, in which you requested additional time 
in which to repay the amounts currently due and owing to the Bank. We are 
supportive of your proposal and we are prepared to allow you limited additional time 
to repay the debt due and owing to the Bank.
Additionally, on 25 May 2010, NatWest recorded an extensive internal note which detailed 
the business strategy and actions that had been agreed upon following the meeting on 19 May 2010. And, having reviewed this note and the email quoted above, I havent seen 
anything that I feel is incompatible with the letter sent by NatWest to P dated 1 June 2010.
Furthermore, P signed its agreement to the terms in the June letter, and didnt sign the letter 
sent by NatWest in October. This means that any discrepancies between the two letters had 
no material effect because only the terms of the June letter were ever agreed. As such, I 
dont feel that I can reasonably conclude that NatWest have acted unfairly here, and I wont 
be upholding this aspect of Ps complaint.
P was not in default as monthly repayments of Â£10,000 continued to be made and were 
being made when the receivers were appointed
The Â£10,000 per month payments to which P refers to here were agreed in the Repayment 
of Terms letter of June 2010 referenced above. But this Repayment of Terms letter didnt 
constitute a new loan agreement and didnt mean that Ps credit facilities were no longer in a 
state of default having not been repaid by P by the expiry date of the loans.
Additionally, NatWest appointed the receivers in December 2010 because other terms hadnt 
been adhered to by P, including that the properties hadnt been sold by P in the months 
leading up to that point as had been agreed. As such, Im satisfied that NatWest didnt act 
unfairly towards P by defaulting the loans when they did, and I wont be upholding this 
aspect of Ps complaint.
The overdraft was for purposes not associated with the loan and an overdraft wasnt 
appropriate for what it was used for and should have been a loan instead. Also, the
purpose behind rolling the overdraft up into a loan was so that the overdraft was secured on
the property meant for the loan
The overdraft was first approved in September 2007 and was intended to provide support for 
a range of ancillary activities such as purchasing vehicles to carry waste from the 
development site.
P maintains that NatWest should have arranged a loan for this purpose, rather than an 
overdraft. However, its for NatWest to decide what form of finance it wants to offer to a 
customer, and I havent seen anything in the information provided to this service which 
would suggest that in providing the overdraft to P that NatWest werent providing P with a 
form of credit which it felt was most suitable at that time for the purpose intended.
P struggled to keep the current account balance within the agreed overdraft limit, and it 
became increasingly evident that P would continue to struggle to do so. In response to this, 
NatWest transposed the overdraft to a loan, which seems to me to have been a reasonable 
step for NatWest to have taken and one which in theory allowed P to more easily manage 
the cashflow difficulties it was experiencing at that time.
P contends that NatWest took this step to ensure that the overdraft balance was covered by 
the security NatWest held on the loans. But the overdraft balance would in all likelihood have 
been covered by any cross-default clause as is commonly present in business loan 
agreements and so I feel that the security for the loans would most likely also have applied 
to any unpaid overdraft amount.
Ive also seen nothing to suggest that NatWest had any ulterior motives when transferring 
the overdraft to a loan. Accordingly, I dont feel that NatWest have acted unfairly or 
unreasonably here, and I wont be upholding this aspect of Ps complaint.
SummaryAs per the above, I havent seen anything which causes me to conclude that NatWest have 
acted unfairly or unreasonably towards P regarding any of the aspects of Ps complaint 
which are within this services remit to consider.
I realise this wont be the outcome that P was wanting, but it follows from this that my final 
decision will be that I wont be upholding this complaint or instructing NatWest to take any 
further action at this time.
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask P to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 May 2022.
