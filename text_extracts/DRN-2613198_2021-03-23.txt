Complaint
Mr G has complained that CarCashPoint Limited (CarCashPoint) provided him with 
unaffordable logbook loans. He says CarCashPoint lent to him at a time when even payday 
lenders wouldnt.  
  
Background
CarCashPoint provided Mr G with two loans for £560 and £500 in October 2017 and June 
2018. One of our adjudicators looked at this complaint and thought that CarCashPoint didnt 
act unfairly when providing loan 1 but it shouldnt have provided loan 2 as proportionate 
checks would have shown they were unaffordable. 
Mr G didnt disagree with our adjudicator but CarCashPoint did and asked for an 
ombudsman to review the complaint. As the parties are no longer in dispute about loan 1, 
this decision is only looking whether CarCashPoint acted fairly and reasonably when 
providing loan 2 to Mr G.
  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about unaffordable/irresponsible lending -
including the key rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. And Ive
referred to this when deciding Mr Gs complaint.
Having carefully thought about everything, I think that there are two overarching questions
that I need to answer in order to fairly and reasonably decide Mr Gs complaint. These two
questions are:
1. Did CarCashPoint complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that 
Mr G would be able to repay loan 2 in a sustainable way?
o If so, did it make a fair lending decision?
o If not, would those checks have shown that Mr G wouldve been able to do 
so?
2. Did CarCashPoint act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Did CarCashPoint complete reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mr G 
would be able to repay loan 2 in a sustainable way?
CarCashPoint provided this loan while it was authorised and regulated by the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA). The rules and regulations in place required CarCashPoint to 
carry out a reasonable and proportionate assessment of Mr Gs ability to make the 
repayments under this agreement. This assessment is sometimes referred to as an 
affordability assessment or affordability check.
The checks had to be borrower focused  so CarCashPoint had to think about whether 
repaying the loan would cause significant adverse consequences for Mr G. In practice this 
meant that CarCashPoint had to ensure that making the payments to the loan wouldnt 
cause Mr G undue difficulty or adverse consequences.
In other words, it wasnt enough for CarCashPoint to simply think about the likelihood of it 
getting its money back, it had to consider the impact of the loan repayments on Mr G. 
Checks also had to be proportionate to the specific circumstances of the loan application.
In general, what constitutes a proportionate affordability check will be dependent upon a
number of factors including  but not limited to  the particular circumstances of the
consumer (e.g. their financial history, current situation and outlook, and any indications of
vulnerability or financial difficulty) and the amount / type / cost of credit they are seeking.
Even for the same customer, a proportionate check could look different for different
applications.
In light of this, I think that a reasonable and proportionate check ought generally to have
been more thorough:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make
any loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the longer the term of the loan (reflecting the fact that the total cost of the credit is
likely to be greater and the customer is required to make payments for an 
extended period); and
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may also be other factors which could influence how detailed a proportionate check
shouldve been for a given loan application  including (but not limited to) any indications of
borrower vulnerability and any foreseeable changes in future circumstances.
Ive carefully thought about all of the relevant factors in this case.
Were CarCashPoints checks reasonable and proportionate?
CarCashPoint says that it carried out an income and expenditure assessment with Mr G 
prior to providing him with both his loans. CarCashPoints says its checks suggested Mr G 
had more than enough to cover the payments to these loans. 
Ive carefully considered what CarCashPoint has said. But for loan 2 Mr G was looking to 
borrow more before hed even paid off what he already owed. And hed be required to repay 
loans concurrently. So I think that CarCashPoint should have been concerned at why Mr G 
needed further funds on such disadvantageous terms so quickly and it needed to take 
account of the total amount Mr G needed to pay and repayment period. Bearing in mind these circumstances, I think its reasonable and proportionate to have 
expected CarCashPoint to have taken additional steps to verify the information it received. 
And I think that CarCashPoint needed to take additional steps to verify Mr Gs actual monthly 
expenditure. 
As I cant see that this CarCashPoint did do this, I dont think that the checks it carried out 
before providing Mr G with loan 2 were reasonable and proportionate.
Would reasonable and proportionate checks have indicated to CarCashPoint that Mr G 
would have been unable to repay loan 2?
As reasonable and proportionate checks werent carried out before loan was provided, I 
cant say for sure what they wouldve shown. So I need to decide whether it is more likely 
than not that proportionate checks would have told CarCashPoint that Mr G would have 
been unable to sustainably repay his loan.
CarCashPoint was required to establish whether Mr G could make his loan repayments 
without experiencing significant adverse consequences  not just whether the loan payments 
were technically affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Ive carefully considered the information provided. Having done so, its clear that Mr G was 
struggling to manage his finances. Most of his income was being taken up by his existing 
living costs and repayments to his existing commitments. And he was clearly in a cycle of 
payday and high-cost borrowing to try and make ends meet. So I think that proportionate 
checks would have shown CarCashPoint that Mr G was unlikely to be able to repay loan 2 
without borrowing further or suffering significant adverse consequences.
Bearing all of this in mind, Im satisfied that reasonable and proportionate checks would
more likely than not have demonstrated that Mr G would not have been able to make the
repayments to this loan without borrowing further and/or suffering undue difficulty. And, in 
these circumstances, I find that reasonable and proportionate checks would more likely than 
not have alerted CarCashPoint to the fact that Mr G was in no sort of position to make the 
payments on this loan without suffering significant adverse consequences.
Did CarCashPoint act unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr G in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about everything provided. And having done so, Ive not seen anything 
to suggest that CarCashPoint acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr G in some other 
way. So I dont think CarCashPoint acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr G in some 
other way.
Did Mr G lose out as a result of CarCashPoint unfairly providing him with his loan?
As Mr G paid a high amount of interest and charges on a loan that he shouldnt have been 
provided with, Im satisfied that he has lost out as a result of what CarCashPoint did wrong.
So I think that CarCashPoint needs to put things right.  
Fair compensation  what CarCashPoint needs to do to put things right for Mr G
Having thought about everything, CarCashPoint should put things right for Mr G by:
refunding all interest, fees and charges Mr G paid on loan 2;adding interest at 8% per year simple on any refunded amounts from the date they 
were paid by Mr G to the date of settlement
removing any adverse information recorded on Mr Gs credit file as a result of this 
loan.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires CarCashPoint to take off tax from this interest. 
CarCashPoint must give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax it has taken off if he asks 
for one.   
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Gs complaint. CarCashPoint Limited needs 
to put things right in the way set out above.
  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 April 2021.
