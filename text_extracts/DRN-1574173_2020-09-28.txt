The complaint
Mr L complains that esure Insurance Limited mishandled his motor insurance policy.
What happened
For the year from 24 November 2017, Mr L had an esure motor insurance policy. On about 4 
August 2018, Mr L and a third party were involved in a road traffic incident. As his insurer, 
esure dealt with Mr Ls claim and pursued recovery from the third party. 
On 26 October 2018, esure sent Mr L renewal documents for the next year. The total cost 
was stated as £721.57. On about 1 November 2018, esure recovered its outlay from the 
third partys insurer. On 24 November 2018, Mr Ls policy renewed for a year.
In May 2019, Mr L contacted esure. On 17 May 2019, esure sent Mr L a refund of £485.22. 
Later in May 2019, esure said it had paid the refund by mistake and it asked Mr L to repay it.
Mr L declined and complained.
By a final response dated 31 July 2019, esure said it was paying Mr L £100.00 
compensation for the error  but it asked him to repay the £485.22.
Unhappy with that, Mr L brought his complaint to us on 13 September 2019.
Our investigator didnt recommend that the complaint should be upheld. She thought Mr L 
was not due a refund. She said the compensation was a fair and reasonable way to resolve 
the complaint. 
Ms L disagreed with the investigators opinion. He asked for an ombudsman to review the 
complaint. he says, in summary, that he has sent us 9 call recordings from 2018 and 2019.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
It is common for an insurer to treat an open claim as a fault claim unless and until it 
recovers its outlay in full. 
But Im satisfied that by the time esure sent out the renewal documents dated 26 October 
2018, it was treating Mr Ls claim from August 2018 as non-fault. That it reflected in the 
policy schedule, which recorded the claim as follows:
Recovery made? Yes
Ive also seen commercially sensitive underwriting information showing that the claim was 
rated as non- fault.
So Im satisfied that the premium correctly reflected the non-fault claim.
The figure of £721.57 included about £70.00 for optional extras and about £75.00 interest for 
paying by instalments. 
Ive listened to each of the 9 call recordings. None of them bears a date. And they are 
numbered in a non-chronological way.
But I can tell that calls 8 and 9 related to Mr Ls unhappiness at the renewal premium in 
November 2018. From call 8, I note that Mr L had changed his vehicle in April 2018 and that 
had increased his premium.
In call 9, esure wrongly said that the open claim was rating as a fault claim, so there would 
be a re-rating and a refund.
I can tell that call 5 was on about 7 May 2019. The call-handler said she would initiate a re-
rating  but she didnt mention any figure for a refund.
Call 4 was in mid-May 2019. Mr L queried why his monthly instalments were still about 
£60.00. I find that the call-handler gave Mr L confusing information.
However, Ive been satisfied that the figure of £721.57 correctly reflected the noon-fault 
claim. The refund of £485.22 was about two thirds of the total cost of £721.57. It reduced the 
total cost to £236.35 including the optional extras and interest. So I accept that the refund 
was a mistake. 
I dont condone such a mistake. And I accept that it put Mr L to some trouble and caused 
him some distress when esure tried to correct it. But I consider that its payment of £100.00 is 
fair and reasonable compensation for such distress and inconvenience.
I dont have the legal power to direct Mr L to repay esure the mistaken payment of £485.22. 
But I dont find that esure treated Mr L unfairly or unreasonably by seeking to recover that 
mistaken payment.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. I dont 
direct esure Insurance Limited to do any more in response to this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 October 2020.
