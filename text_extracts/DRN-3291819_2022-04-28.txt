The complaint
Mrs Ms complaint is that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, wont refund to her the money that she paid for a timeshare trial membership. Her 
husband is also involved with her complaint.
What happened
Mrs M and her husband entered into a trial membership agreement in January 2017 for the 
right to reserve five holiday weeks within the following three years with a timeshare 
company. The price of the trail membership was £3,995 which Mrs M paid using a loan from 
Barclays Partner Finance. She signed a fixed sum loan agreement for that amount which 
she agreed to repay by 36 monthly instalments of £131.34.
Mrs M and her husband then entered into an acquisition agreement in October 2017 to buy 
10,000 holiday club membership points from the timeshare company for a price of £6,000. 
Mrs Ms husband also entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner 
Finance for a loan of £9,276. £3,276.19 was then paid to Mrs Ms loan account and her loan 
was closed in February 2018.
Mrs M and her husband made a claim to Barclays Partner Finance under section 75 of the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974 that the timeshare had been mis-sold to them. Barclays Partner 
Finance didnt respond to that claim so they complained to this service. Our investigator 
didnt recommend that their complaint should be upheld. She said that the evidence 
available didnt support their claim for a refund. Mrs Ms husband has asked for their 
complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. 
As Mrs M entered into a loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance to pay for the trail 
membership and her husband entered into a loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance 
to pay for the membership points under the acquisition agreement (and to repay part of 
Mrs Ms loan), the complaint has now been split and Mrs Ms husbands complaint about his 
claim against Barclays Partner Finance is being dealt with separately. In this complaint Im 
only considering whether Barclays Partner Finances response to a claim from Mrs M that 
the trial membership was mis-sold to her was fair and reasonable.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I dont consider that Mrs Ms complaint should be upheld for these reasons:
in certain circumstances, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 gives a 
consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the 
provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
supplier;
to be able to uphold a complaint from Mrs M about Barclays Partner Finance, I must 
be satisfied that theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by the 
timeshare company relating to the trial membership and that Barclays Partner 
Finances response to her claim under section 75 wasnt fair or reasonable  but Im 
not determining the outcome of Mrs Ms claim under section 75 as only a court would 
be able to do that;
Mrs M and her husband entered into a trial membership agreement with the 
timeshare company in January 2017 for the right to reserve five holiday weeks within 
the following three years  and they also signed the trial membership agreement 
conditions, a declaration about their understanding of what had been agreed, and a 
nine page information form about the trial membership (which included information 
about their right to withdraw from the agreement - which they had also signed);
Mrs M entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance in 
January 2017 to pay for the trail membership and £3,276.19 of that loan was repaid 
in November 2017 and the loan was closed in February 2018;
Mrs M and her husband entered into the acquisition agreement in October 2017 and 
her husband entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that theres been a breach 
of the trial membership agreement by the timeshare company or that Mrs M and her 
husband were induced into entering into the trail membership agreement by a 
misrepresentation made by the timeshare company;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect Mrs M and her husband not to have 
entered into the acquisition agreement if they were concerned that there had been a 
breach of contract or misrepresentation of the trail membership agreement by that 
company;
our investigator also considered whether there was an unfair relationship with 
Barclays Partner Finance under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act  but I 
dont consider that a complaint has been made that there was an unfair relationship 
between Mrs M and Barclays Partner Finance so Im unable to consider that issue as 
part of this complaint (and, although I make no finding on this issue, my view is that 
no evidence has been provided to show that there was an unfair relationship 
between them);
Barclays Partner Finance didnt issue a response to Mrs M and her husbands claim 
so I cant say that it responded fairly and reasonably to that claim  it should have 
responded to that claim and, if it had done so, I consider it to be more likely than not 
that it would have concluded that any claim relating to the trail membership 
agreement shouldnt have been upheld because there hadnt been a breach of 
contract or misrepresentation by the timeshare company of that agreement; 
Mrs M wasnt a party to the loan that Barclays Partner Finance made to her husband 
and which was used to pay for the acquisition agreement so, in this decision, I 
havent considered whether there was a breach of contract or misrepresentation of 
that agreement and a separate decision will be issued on her husbands complaint 
about Barclays Partner Finance; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Barclays Partner Finance to refund to Mrs M any of the money that she paid for the 
trial membership, to pay her any compensation or to take any other action in 
response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs M to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 May 2022.
