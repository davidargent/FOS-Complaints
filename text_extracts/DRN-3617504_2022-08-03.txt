The complaint
Mr E complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and the service he received when a 
buyer raised a chargeback against him.
What happened
Mr E sold an item through an online selling platform in October 2020 for £649. This purchase 
was processed via PayPal.
In January 2022, the buyer of this item raised a chargeback, saying the item wasnt received. 
PayPal responded to the chargeback, providing the buyers bank with tracking information Mr 
E provided them at the time of the transaction. But due to time that had elapsed since the 
purchase, this tracking number was no longer valid. PayPal didnt return to Mr E for any 
further information.
The buyers bank upheld the chargeback in the buyers favour. And so, PayPal proceeded to 
debit Mr Es account by £649, plus a £12 dispute fee. And when Mr E didnt bring his 
account back to a balance of £0, they instructed a collection agency to collect this. Mr E was 
unhappy about this, so he raised a complaint.
Mr E didnt think PayPals decision to debit his account was fair. He thought he shouldve 
been given the chance to provide additional information which showed the item was 
delivered. And he thought if they had, its likely the chargeback wouldnt have been upheld. 
Or, that he wouldve been covered under PayPals Seller Protection Policy (SPP). So, he 
wanted PayPal to refund him the £649, plus the £12 dispute fee he was charged. And he 
wanted to be compensated £1,500 for the upset and inconvenience the issued caused.
PayPal responded initially and didnt agree. They didnt think they were responsible for the 
buyers banks chargeback decision. So, they thought they were fair to debit Mr Es account 
in line with this. Mr H remained unhappy, so he referred his complaint to our service. 
While the complaint was with our service, PayPal took the decision to refund Mr Es account 
the £649 and the £12 dispute fee. But they didnt offer any compensation. Mr E asked for our 
service to continue with our investigation.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and upheld it. They recognised PayPal had 
refunded the payment and dispute fee to Mr E. And they explained this is something they 
wouldve direct PayPal to do, as they thought PayPal shouldve requested further proof of 
delivery information when it became clear the tracking number was no longer valid. So, they 
thought Mr E shouldve been covered under the terms of the SPP and that PayPal were 
unfair to debit Mr Es account. Our investigator recognised the upset and inconvenience this 
caused, evidence by Mr Es contact with PayPal during the period between the debit and the 
refund. So, our investigator thought PayPal should pay Mr E an additional £150 to 
compensate Mr E for this.
Mr E initially rejected this recommendation, explaining he didnt think it was enough to 
compensate him or deter PayPal from doing the same thing to another customer. Our 
investigator explained the £150 fell in line with our services approach, as well as explaining 
our service is unable to punish businesses or consider service provided to another customer. 
Following this, Mr E accepted our investigators recommendation. But PayPal didnt respond, 
despite several chaser emails from our investigator. As PayPal didnt respond, the complaint 
has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
Before I explain why Ive reached my decision, I think it would be useful for me to explain 
exactly what Im able to consider. I recognise Mr E is unhappy with PayPals business 
processes and has concerns that other customers may receive a similar level of service 
which he feels would be unfair. And hed like their processes to be changed because of this. 
But this isnt something our service is able to consider or direct as this would fall under the 
remit of the industry regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. So, I havent thought about 
this further.
Instead, Ive considered the complaint on its own merits, based on its own individual 
circumstances. And having done so, I think PayPal acted unfairly.
I agree with PayPal that the decision to uphold the chargeback raised by Mr Es buyer was 
ultimately the responsibility of the buyers bank. So, I dont think it would be fair to hold them 
responsible for this. But I would expect PayPal to ensure Mr E had a fair and reasonable 
opportunity to provide the buyers bank with evidence to defend the claim, as part of the 
chargeback process.
I recognise PayPal intended to do this, and they provided the tracking number they already 
held on file from October 2020. But its not disputed that due to the time that had elapsed 
since the purchase, this tracking number no longer worked. I wouldve expected PayPal to 
ensure this tracking number provided the evidence it intended to before submitting it. And if 
they had done this, they wouldve realised the tracking number was no longer valid. 
So, at this point I wouldve expected PayPal to return to Mr E and give him the opportunity to 
provide any additional he may hold that would support his position that the item had been 
delivered. But PayPal have confirmed they didnt do this.
Mr E has since provided both PayPal and our service a copy of messages sent between 
himself and the buyer, where the buyer confirms delivery of the item. I think this evidence is 
compelling and I think had it been provided to the buyers bank during the chargeback 
process, it wouldve most likely led to a different outcome.
But Im aware I cant say this for certain and PayPal still had no responsibility over this 
decision. But PayPal do have a responsibility to ensure the terms of their SPP is applied 
correctly, and fairly. And in this situation, I think the evidence was compelling enough to 
ensure if the chargeback was found in the buyers favour, that Mr E incurred no financial 
loss. So, had PayPal acted fairly, I dont think Mr Es account would have been debited. But 
it was and so, I think PayPal were unreasonable when taking this action. As I think PayPal acted both unreasonably and unfairly, Ive then thought about what I think 
they should do to put things right. 
Putting things right
Any direction or award I make is intended to place Mr E back in the position he wouldve 
been, had PayPal acted fairly in the first instance. Since the complaint came to our service, 
PayPal have already refunded Mr E the £649 they debited, plus the £12 dispute fee. So, I 
think this places Mr E back in the financial position he shouldve been in and Im glad to see 
PayPal have done this pro-actively.
But I dont think this adequately address, or resolves, the inconvenience and upset this 
situation will have caused Mr E. I think it wouldve been upsetting for Mr E to realise his 
account had been debited and placed in a negative balance. And I think this wouldve been 
made worse when he was contacted by a collection agency seeking payment.
I can also see Mr E contacted PayPal on several occasions, via several different channels, 
to try and resolve the situation over a period of around three months. And I think this 
wouldve taken both time and effort which wouldve been inconvenient to him. 
Our investigator recommended PayPal pay Mr E an additional £150 to recognise the impact 
Ive outlined in the paragraphs above, which Mr E has accepted. I think this payment is a fair 
one and in line with what I wouldve direct, had it not already been put forward. So, I think 
PayPal should make this payment to Mr E to adequately resolve the complaint in its entirety.
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I uphold Mr Es complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie 
SCA and I direct them to take the following action:
Pay Mr E £150 to recognise the upset and inconvenience hes been caused when 
seeking a refund of the payment that was debited from his account unfairly.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr E to accept or 
reject my decision before 31 August 2022.
