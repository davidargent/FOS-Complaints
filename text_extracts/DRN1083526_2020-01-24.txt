K822xcomplaint
Miss R has complained about a number of loans  she took out through a company called 
Elevate Credit International Limited, trading at the time as Sunny. Miss R says she was lent 
to irresponsibly and the loans caused her financial problems.
To keep  things simple  Ill refer mainly to Sunny throughout this decision.
background
We now know that Miss R took out some 42 instalment loans from Sunny between 
December 2015  and April 2017. Ive enclosed a summary of Miss Rs borrowing with Sunny, 
based on the information it provided to us. It can be found in the appendix at the end of this 
decision. 
One of our adjudicators looked  into the complaint and said they thought  it should  be upheld  
from the point of loan number  6 onwards. Sunny  initially said it didnt agree with this and that 
it hadnt done anything wrong.  But later it made an offer to settle  the complaint from the point 
of loan 27 onwards.  Miss R doesnt agree to this so the complaint has come  to me for an 
ombudsmans final decision.
Im sorry  Miss R has had to wait a while for her case to reach this stage. I appreciate its 
taken a long time.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. Ive followed this approach when thinking  about  Miss Rs 
complaint.
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. 
In practice this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure that 
Miss R could repay all the loans  she was given in a sustainable  manner.  These checks  
ought to have taken into account a range of different factors, such as the amounts being  
lent, the total repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. 
With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think  less thorough checks  
might be reasonable  and proportionate. However,  certain factors  might point to the fact that 
Sunny should  have  fairly and reasonably done more to establish that any lending  was 
sustainable for the consumer. 
These factors include:
the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
Ref: DRN10835262the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history or pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. So, Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss R could  sustainably repay  the loans; not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.
Of course,  the loan being affordable on this basis might be an indication that Miss R could 
sustainably make the repayments.  But it doesnt  automatically follow  that this is the case. 
This is because the relevant regulations define  sustainable as being  without undue 
difficulties and in particular, the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments as well as without having to borrow  to meet the 
repayments. So, it follows that a lender should realise,  or it ought to have fairly and 
reasonably realised, that a borrower  wont be able to make their repayments  sustainably if 
they are unlikely to be able to make them without borrowing further.
Sunny told us it carried out certain affordability and credit checks before agreeing to lend to 
Miss R. Ive thought about this and Ive also looked  at the overall  pattern of lending history 
with a view to seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen  that 
further lending  was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. Ive considered whether, at some 
point, Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have provided any further  loans. 
Our adjudicator said that they thought the complaint about loans 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ought not to 
be upheld as they appeared affordable. Ive looked carefully at these and taken note of 
Miss Rs declared income at around  the time.  Ive also looked at what she said about  her 
monthly expenditure. 
With this information,  and bearing in mind what Ive said above about the length of the 
lending relationship, I think the checks which Sunny most likely carried  out appear to have  
been proportionate for loans 1  5. And I think these  levels  of checks,  together  with the 
income and expenditure details provided  by Miss R, would have made  those particular loans 
appear affordable.  
However, I think the emerging pattern of repeated lending from the point of loan 6 onwards 
in this case would have looked  different and therefore required a more thorough and 
responsible approach. The overall  pattern of Sunnys lending to Miss R should have caused 
it to see, in my view,  that it shouldnt have  provided any further loans from this point 
onwards. 
This is because this was Miss Rs sixth short-term loan application with Sunny in just 6 
weeks or so. And in common  with her borrowing pattern  thus far, she was again  asking  to 
borrow from Sunny directly after paying off the previous loan. So Sunny ought  to have 
realised that Miss R wasnt merely borrowing to deal with short-term cash-flow problems; 
she was borrowing very regularly, to address shortfalls in her income and to meet  an 
ongoing need. Miss R was having  to consistently take out high interest,  short-term  lending 
over a sustained period  and the indebtedness caused by this type of borrowing was harmful,  
in my view.  Sunny  should have seen  this and ought to have  realised Miss R was at risk of 
not managing  to repay the loans sustainably or getting into financial difficulties. 
Ref: DRN10835263So Im upholding  this complaint in respect of loans 6 - 42. Sunny repeatedly lent to Miss R in 
an unsustainable manner  because:
 
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended  for short-term use, over an extended time period; and
the length of time over which Miss R borrowed  was likely to have had negative 
implications on her ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market 
for these high-cost  loans
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss R paid on loans 6 - 42;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement
the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 - 42 should be completely 
removed from Miss Rs credit  file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give Miss R a certificate 
showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given,  I partly uphold Miss Rs complaint. Elevate Credit  International 
Limited should put things right for Miss R as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss R to accept 
or reject my decision before 24 February  2020.
