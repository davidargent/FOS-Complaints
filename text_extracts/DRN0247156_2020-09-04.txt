Mr H complains that Almary Green Investments Limited (Almary Green) failed to advise him 
appropriately about his Fixed Protection 2014 (FP2014) application. Consequently, Mr H 
has suffered a financial loss.
background
Almary Green were  advising  Mr H about his pensions and investments over a number of 
years. Mr H was a Premium client of Almary Green. He signed a number of different client 
agreements. They appear to be similar. I think one that is particularly relevant was signed by 
Mr H in July 2013.  The service provided was a twice-yearly review for portfolios in excess  of 
£400,000. This cost 0.5% of the fund value a year.
Mr H was provided with advice in June 2013. This was before he was due to retire. He 
intended to continue working  as a self-employed consultant for the same employer. I have 
seen a note of a meeting dated 4 June 2013.  The note was headed  pre-retirement advice.
It was recorded  that Mr H expected to receive  a final salary pension when he was 65. He 
was already receiving  an annuity income. His pension funds were worth  £743,000. 
Contributions were being made into a personal pension by Mr Hs employer. A note was 
made that it would be as well to inform the provider that no further contributions  would be 
made to the pension  plan. This was also recorded  as an action point.
A financial planning report was issued to Mr H in July 2013. This dealt with some  
investments and a personal pension in which Mr H had been  invested in a deposit fund. 
Advice was given to switch into a range of different funds within the pension  policy.
In October  2013, information was sent by a pension provider to Almary Green about Mr Hs 
pensions. It appears this was requested by the adviser at Almary Green.
Mr H says he was advised by Almary  Green  to apply  for FP2014 around November 2013. 
The FP2014  certificate was issued by HMRC in February 2014. One of the conditions  of 
FP2014 was that no further pension contributions could  be made. Mr H told us the 
application was made online and there is no correspondence with HMRC.
Almary Green reviewed  Mr Hs investments and pensions in April 2014.  Mr H was likely to 
pay some  income tax at 40%. Additional pension contributions were discussed as a possible 
way of reducing the tax paid. An action point from the meeting was for Mr H to confirm any 
potential pension contribution.
A review in October 2014 discussed the value of the pension funds and a switch  of funds. 
At a review  meeting on 6 May 2015  it was established that Mr Hs former employer had 
continued to make payments into his pension in error. The employer should have stopped 
making payments  when  Mr H retired in June 2013.  Mr Hs former employer has admitted this 
was an administrative error which should not have happened. As a result,  Mr H has lost his 
FP2014.
Mr H discussed the LTA with Almary  Green.  In a letter dated 14 March  2016 they set out 
details of the calculation of his remaining LTA. He had crystallised benefits when he bought 
an annuity and took his final salary  pension benefits.  These used up 26.31%  of his LTA. The 
Ref: DRN02471562remaining value of the LTA was just under £91,000 using values from February 2016  and 
the LTA of £1.25 million. They strongly  recommended Mr H applied for FP2016 and no 
further pension  contributions should be made.
I understand Mr H applied for FP2016.
Mr H complained to Almary Green.  He said they failed to advise him of the conditions  of 
FP2014 and that having  secured  FP2014,  no further  contributions  should  be made to his 
pension. He also said Almary Green had access to his pension records  so should have been 
aware his former employer was continuing  to pay into his pension. They could have taken 
steps to make sure this did not happen. Mr H therefore holds Almary Green responsible  for 
the loss of FP2014.
Almary Green did not uphold Mr Hs complaint.  In summary, they said they do not hold 
any information about any discussions Mr H says he had with them about applying  for 
FP2014. They did not agree they are responsible  for what  may or may not have been 
said. They  also pointed out the information  on the application form makes it clear that no 
further contributions  could  be made .
Mr H disagreed with Almary Greens  response  and referred his complaint to this service.
Our investigator concluded that Almary Green  were  not responsible for the payments into 
Mr Hs pension continuing after Mr H had left his employer.  The error was made  by Mr Hs 
former employer.
Mr H did not agree. He reiterated that Almary  Green should have noticed  the payments were  
continuing in error.  In any event, they had failed to advise him of the importance of FP2014s 
stipulation that no further contributions should  be made  to his pension  plan once  FP2014  
was secured. Had they done so, Mr H contends that he would have taken the appropriate 
action to mitigate the effect of the continuing  contributions on his FP2014.
One of my colleagues  issued a provisional decision  in which  he concluded  the complaint 
should be upheld.  He explained  Mr H was entitled  to rely on Almary Greens advice  and to 
expect the advice to be suitable  for his circumstances. He was persuaded that, on balance, 
Almary Green should have checked  whether contributions were being  made  and therefore 
invalidating FP2014 for Mr H.
Mr H sent us information about  how he took his pension benefits. He explained he needed to 
cover some capital expenditure. He did not want to take any significantly different course of 
action from the action he would have taken  if FP2014 were in place. A tax charge of 
£38,635.25 was deducted from his pension fund. This was 55% of the £70,245.90  excess 
over his LTA.
Mr H opted to use flexible  drawdown. This means his pension  fund will be subject to a 
further test against  the LTA at age 75. He will incur a tax charge of 25% of any growth  in the 
fund.
I reviewed the file and we asked Mr H for some  information.  He provided details of his 
pension benefits  when he applied for FP2016. When he bought an annuity in 2009, he used  
15.94% of the available LTA. And he used another 10.37%  in July 2014. 
Ref: DRN02471563Mr H used the remaining  73.69% of the LTA in June 2017.  He transferred £154,929.72 into a 
SIPP. The total value  of the SIPP was £999,096.23. He crystallised £921,125 on 
22 June 2017  from which he took a tax-free  cash sum of £230,281.25.
The remaining  £70,245.90 was crystallised on 30 June 2020. A tax charge of £38,635.25  
was deducted.  The increase in value of Mr Hs pensions during  2016 and 2017 was due to 
the investment  growth within the funds.  No contributions were paid during this period.
No formal agreement  was made with Mr Hs former  employer about  the pension  
contributions. It was eventually agreed  he would keep the contributions  by forgoing his 
consultancy fees.
I issued my provisional decision on 28 July 2020.  I set out my provisional findings and have 
repeated them below.
Did Almary Green advise Mr H to apply for FP2014?
The reduction in the LTA to £1.25 million  was announced in the Chancellors Autumn 
Statement on 5 December 2012.  Applications had to be made  before 6 April 2014 and no 
further pension  contributions could  be made.
Almary Green met with Mr H in June 2013  and provided advice in July 2013.  There  was no 
mention of FP2014. Almary Greens  premium service was for Almary Green to carry out 
reviews every six months.  These appear  to have taken place in April and October  for most 
years, although the meeting in June 2013  did not fit in with the sequence. Almary Green 
does not have a record of a meeting later in the year. However, Almary Green requested  
fund values in October  2013 and Mr H says he was advised by Almary Green  to apply for 
FP2014 in November 2013.
The information recorded by Almary  Green  in June 2013 shows  Mr H had already 
crystallised some of his pension benefits.  The calculations completed  in 2016 show  the 
crystallised benefits used  26.31%  of the LTA. Mr Hs uncrystallised  pension benefits were  
worth £743,000 in June  2013, according to Almary Greens  fact find. His remaining LTA 
would have been just over £920,000 at that time using the lower LTA of £1.25 million, which 
was to be introduced  in April 2014.
Almary Green does  not have any records of Mr H having FP2014. They  say if they had 
advised him to do so they would have  a record on their system. On the other hand, Mr H 
says he was advised by Almary Green  to make the application.
Where there is a dispute about what has happened, I have to decide what  is more  likely to 
have happened. I do this by evaluating  the evidence and deciding  how much  weight to apply 
to the evidence. I then reach a conclusion about the outcome, on the balance  of 
probabilities. 
Mr H was a premium client of Almary Green.  He should have had a review  of his finances  
every six months. Although the advice  in July 2013  was not in line with his usual sequence 
of meetings, I am satisfied he was expecting a review  in October 2013. Regular reviews 
appear to have recommenced  in April 2014.  As no mention was made  of future  reviews  in 
June or July 2013, I think the expectation  would have  been for a review  in October.
Ref: DRN02471564Almary Green requested information about Mr Hs pension plans in October 2013. There is 
no explanation  about what this was used for. I have attached some weight to this evidence. 
It indicates Almary Green was providing advice  in October 2013.
Mr H provided  a copy of the certificate  confirming he had FP2014. He was paying a fee to 
Almary Green to advise  him about  his financial affairs, including his pensions.  He says 
Almary Green advised him to apply for FP2014. I also attached  significant weight to this 
evidence. I think it would  be unusual  for anyone to pay for a service and then to either ask 
someone else to advise them, or to take action  themselves. I think it is more  likely the advice  
to apply for FP2014  came from Almary Green.
Even if I am wrong about my conclusion that Almary Green advised Mr H to apply for 
FP2014, I think they should have  considered  this as part of the service they provided.
What should have happened?
In my view, Almary Green should  have been considering  whether  to advise Mr H to apply for 
FP2014. He was retiring, although  continuing some work on a consultancy  basis.  His 
pension funds were  still some way short of the reduced LTA of £1.25 million.  
The adviser should have clearly explained  to Mr H the implications of having FP2014. Mr H 
would not be able to make  any more pension contributions.  Both Mr H and the adviser  knew 
the contributions  from Mr Hs employer should have been cancelled.  I think if Mr H had been 
advised about the importance of those contributions being stopped  that he would  have done  
so. When he was told about this, he did ensure the contributions were  cancelled.
Mr H was still some way short of the new lower  LTA of £1.25 million.  However,  an important 
factor to consider was the investment growth that could  be achieved. It also appears to me 
that Almary  Green should  have been considering whether to advise Mr H to make additional 
pension contributions before 5 April 2014. In this way, he could have maximised  the tax relief 
available as well as avoiding  the risk his funds would breach  the LTA.  He would then have 
been able to use the LTA of £1.5 million  if FP2014 applied.
In summary,  I think Almary Green  should have advised Mr H to apply for FP2014  and make 
additional pension  contributions before 5 April 2014.  Mr H should  have  been  told to ensure 
no further contributions  were paid after 5 April 2014,  including any from his employer.
Who caused the loss of FP2014?
The loss of FP2014 was caused by Mr Hs employer continuing to pay pension contributions 
into his SIPP  after 5 April 2014. This was after Mr H left employment in June 2013.  However,  
I think the loss of FP2014 could and should  have  been avoided  if Almary Green had given 
Mr H suitable advice  as set out above.  
In my view, Almary Greens failure to give suitable  advice caused Mr Hs loss.
I also explained how Almary Green should compensate Mr H.
Almary Green did not agree  with my provisional  decision. They  said:
They have no record on file of any advice given to Mr H about Fixed  Protection 2014 
but accept that the adviser may have discussed this with him. The balance of 
Ref: DRN02471565probability suggests that he did. But the balance of probability also suggests the 
adviser told Mr H that he would not be able to make contributions  after April 2014, 
but Mr H forgot. 
Applying for FP14 was something that Mr H did online. The first thing he would have  
seen is information  about the loss of protection if his employer was making 
contributions. Even if he didnt  read the notes, as they say he should have done, he 
must have seen this which illustrates  the point  about loss of protection and workplace  
pensions quite  clearly.  He also signed the declaration that he would notify HMRC if 
any of the provisions were broken.
Mr H did not provide them with a copy of his FP14 certificate, nor that he had applied  
for it. If they had then they would have  made  a note on the front screen of his client  
record so that anyone who dealt with it was aware. 
Mr Hs ex-employer should have  stopped  making contributions to his company 
pension scheme. This is basic  accounting  work  which  they have admitted they 
overlooked and did not pick up until it was pointed out by their auditor. If they had 
picked this up prior to April 2014  it would not have caused a problem.
Mr H has said that in or around November 2013  he knew  that pension  contributions  
were still being made in error. In knowledge of the error both he and his employer 
should have taken steps to make sure that the contributions were stopped which  
would have prevented the loss of FP2014.
They maintain  that Mr H and his new adviser  could have taken action to meet his 
objectives in a more tax efficient  way. They still could do this to prevent further tax at 
75, although they are concerned that they wont. Instead, they appear to have taken  
a very simplistic approach which has incurred maximum tax. They provided an 
example calculation to illustrate  how tax could have been  saved.
They do not see how it can be fair to leave them with an unknown future tax bill when 
they cannot be sure that care will be taken to ensure the tax does not become due. 
For example, if Mr H withdraws the growth in the fund as income prior to 75, he will 
only have to pay income tax and not incur a further  LTAC.
As a Premium  client Mr H was entitled  to two meetings a year,  one of which was 
brought forward to June because he was due to retire, so they do not agree  that he 
would be expecting  one in October. There would be little to be gained  by repeating 
the exercise in October as a review was conducted in June to take account of this 
lifestyle change.  Mr H says they told him to apply for FP14 in November 2013 which 
might suggest a less formal conversation  was held at that time. 
They suggest that the comments about whether Mr H should have made any pension  
contributions prior to April 2014  is a red herring and would have very little impact  on 
the loss of FP2014.
The decision as it stands penalises Almary  Green but not Mr H for his approach  to 
the matter, his ex-employer for their poor administration, or Mr Hs new adviser for 
not planning effectively.
They also asked why they should  be accountable for interest from 30 June 2020  
when the decision  was not until 28 July 2020.
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having done so, I have come  to the same 
decision as set out in my provisional decision and for the same reasons.
Many of the points made by Almary  Green  in response to my provisional decision were  dealt 
with in my provisional decision. My starting  point is that Mr H was a premium client  and was 
Ref: DRN02471566being advised by Almary  Green. It is not in dispute that he applied  for and was granted  
FP2014. It is also not in dispute that he lost FP2014 because his ex-employer continued  to 
make pension contributions after he left employment with them.
In my view, the key point in time is in October to November 2013.  This is when Almary 
Green requested  information about Mr Hs pensions. He also applied for FP2014  in 
November 2013.  The evidence shows Almary Green requested  information. If they werent 
providing advice  to Mr H, why did they request  the valuations at this time? As I explained in 
my provisional decision, I think it is most likely Almary Green provided advice to apply  for 
FP2014.
As I have concluded Almary Green was providing  advice to Mr H, the advice had to be 
suitable. They have  explained they do not have records of the advice. However, this does 
not help them. Although  they argue they did not provide advice to apply for FP2014, I think 
the evidence shows they did provide the advice.
I would expect the advice to have  been recorded. Mr H was still some  way short  of the LTA, 
particularly at the higher level available if he applied for FP2014. I think  advice should have 
been considered about  making pension contributions before the end of the tax year. I say 
this because this was considered in April 2014 in the new tax year.  It seems  odd to me that 
the adviser should have considered making the contributions after Mr H had already secured 
FP2014. 
I remain of the view that although  the cause of the loss was Mr Hs ex-employer continuing 
to make pension contributions that Almary  Green  could, and should, have given suitable 
advice that would have prevented the loss. Almary  Green is therefore liable for the loss Mr H 
has suffered.
The adviser also knew that contributions from Mr Hs ex-employer should have stopped. This 
was recorded  in the notes  of meetings in June 2013.  I think  the adviser should have made  
the importance of this clear to Mr H. 
I have carefully considered Mr Hs actions.  This includes the fact he signed the application  
for FP2014 and accepted no further pension contributions could be made.  Clearly,  Mr H 
should have taken notice of that requirement. However, in my view,  Almary Green  should  
have advised  him about the implications  of applying for FP2014. There  is no record  of the 
advice being given. The adviser  did not record any notes about  what  had happened in 
October and November 2013.  But information  had been requested  from a pension provider 
about Mr Hs pensions.  
Mr H could have taken  his pension benefits  in a different way. However,  I am satisfied he 
would have taken  the benefits  in the way he has, if FP2014 applied. He could have changed 
this, but I think the steps were reasonable in the circumstances.  There are many  ways to 
take pension benefits. Although one factor to consider is the tax paid, the benefits are also 
important. 
There may be a future LTA charge at age 75. Mr H could withdraw income, but he does not 
need the income and would otherwise have left the income within his pension  fund.  In my 
view, leaving the income in the pension fund in this situation is not unreasonable.  There  may 
not be a further  LTA charge at age 75, but I do not know what  any charge will be. I have not 
been provided with any alternative  methods about how the compensation should be 
calculated. Almary Green should compensate Mr H for the future  LTA charge when it is due, 
Ref: DRN02471567if a charge is made. This will depend on Almary  Green being  in a position  to make payment 
at that time.
Fair compensation
My aim is to put Mr H back in the position  he would now be in if Almary  Green  had given him 
suitable advice.  That easily  stated objective  is difficult to achieve  because there are a 
number of variables  involved.  It is difficult to say exactly what  suitable advice should have 
been. Almary Green has also made  arguments that Mr H should  have taken action  to 
mitigate his loss.
I have already explained that I think Mr H should have been advised to pay additional 
pension contributions before 5 April 2014. I do not know  what  level of contributions he would 
have been eligible to pay, or what would have been advisable at the time. I do know  he paid 
contributions, albeit inadvertently, because his ex-employer continued to pay those 
contributions. So, in my view, Mr H should  have paid more  contributions  into his SIPP before 
5 April 2014. However, the contributions  made after 6 April 2014 should not have been paid. 
In my view those two factors should  be set off against each other.
Almary Green made  the point Mr H could  have acted  in a way to reduce the amount of tax 
he paid. Mr H has said this did not suit his plans. As I shall show  below,  the LTA charge is 
generally 25% of the pension fund. Although it may be paid in different ways meaning  a 
different financial outcome, the effect  is broadly a charge of 25%.  I have considered the 
actions taken by Mr H and I do not consider these were unreasonable in his circumstances.
When Mr H crystallised  the last part of his pension funds,  he incurred a charge of 
£38,635.25. This was 55% of the excess value over the LTA.  The balance  was paid to Mr H 
as a taxed lump sum. However, if Mr H had been  able to take the £70,245.90  without the 
LTA charge being applied, he would have been  entitled to take 25% as a tax-free sum. He 
would then have  been liable to pay income  tax at his marginal  rate. I assume Mr H would 
have paid income tax at 40% on 75% of the fund. This is equivalent to 30% on the whole 
fund. In this case that would  have been £70,245.90 x 30% being £21,073.77. If this is 
deducted from the £38,635.25 it leaves an additional tax liability  of £17,561.48.  
In my view the loss is £17,561.48. This is 25% of £70,245.90. Mr H crystallised the last part 
of his pension  benefits on 30 June 2020.  Simple interest is to be added at a rate of 8% gross 
a year from that date to the date compensation is to be paid.
In addition to this loss, there is the possibility  of a further LTA charge of 25% of the growth in 
the pension fund since it was crystallised.  This will need to be tested when Mr H reaches the 
age of 75.
Mr H has also been caused some distress and inconvenience as a result of having  to pay 
the LTA charge. In my view, this was caused  by Almary Greens failure to give him suitable 
advice. Almary Green should pay him £200 to compensate for this.
My final decision
I uphold the complaint. Almary Green Investments Limited should pay Mr H £17,561.48.  
Simple interest should be added to that sum at a rate of 8% gross a year from 30 June 2020 
until the date settlement  is made.
Ref: DRN02471568Almary Green should also pay any further  LTA charge arising at age 75.
In addition to this Almary Green should  pay Mr H £200 for the distress and inconvenience  
caused by the failure to give him suitable  advice.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 4 October  2020.
