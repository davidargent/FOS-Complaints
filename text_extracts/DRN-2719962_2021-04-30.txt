The complaint
Mr H is unhappy AXA Insurance UK Plc didnt tell him it was making a payment to a third 
party, despite him asking it to do so. 
What happened
The details of the case are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again here. 
Instead Ill focus on giving my reasons for my decision.
Mr H has made several complaints relating to this claim which are being dealt with under 
different references at this service.  This decision only relates to the complaint outlined 
above. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusion reached by the investigator for the following 
reasons:
AXA has admitted Mr H had asked for a call to be made to him before it made a 
payment to a third payment. A note was made on its system but there was an 
oversight, and this didnt take place. 
AXA apologised and offered Mr H Â£50 compensation. I think this is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances, so I wont be asking AXA to do anything more here. 
For the reasons above, I do not uphold this complaint. 
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold Mr Hs complaint against AXA Insurance UK Plc. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 May 2021.
