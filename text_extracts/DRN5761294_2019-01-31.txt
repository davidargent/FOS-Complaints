K820x#14complaint
Mrs R complains that NewDay Ltd (NewDay) shouldnt have passed her debt on to a debt 
collection company,  D. Shes  also unhappy with the information  NewDay has given  her 
throughout.
background
Mrs R had a credit card with NewDay. She lost her job in 2017 and fell into arrears on her 
account. NewDay wrote to Mrs R about  this over a number of months.  On 2 May 2018,  she 
contacted NewDay  to discuss this matter with it. 
Mrs R says that during  this call a verbal  agreement was reached with NewDay for a 
repayment plan of £134.83  a month  over three  months. She was therefore surprised and 
upset to find that NewDay had passed the debt to D who was contacting her for payment. So 
she got in touch with NewDay about  this on 26 May 2018.
Mrs R says she didnt call NewDay before being  contacted by D as shed agreed with 
NewDay during  the call on 2 May that shed  call back at the end of the month, once shed  
been paid and the call handlers colleague would set up the plan. Mrs R says her husband  
heard this during the call. But, having  listened  to the call recording, Mrs R says this part of 
the call is missing. Mrs R has sent our service evidence that there is a difference  in the call 
length from the call sent to us to the one shown on her phone  bill of around 2 minutes 43 
seconds. And, when  timed, the customer service element doesn't equate  to the full time 
difference so theres still part of the call recording that hasnt been accounted for.
On 31 May 2018, Mrs R made a payment to NewDay of just over £134.83. And she says 
that, as she complied with the verbal  agreement  shed  reached with NewDay  on 2 May 
2018, it shouldnt  have passed her account  to D.
NewDay says:
-The discussion on the 2 May 2018  was that Mrs R can pay £134.83 over a three 
month period  but she could only pay £50 on that day and start the plan on 4 June. 
The call handler explained  she wouldn't be able to set up the payment arrangement 
because itd be starting more than a month  later. Instead, she confirmed shed  save  
the quote to the system for when Mrs R called back so a colleague could pull the 
quote up and put it in place. 
-The account was in arrears and the contract had been breached and, in these 
circumstances, they were allowed to transfer the collection of the debt or sell it to a 
third party.  This is the case  even  if a repayment arrangement  had been  put in place.
-It wouldn't tamper with calls in order to influence the outcome on a case. Mrs R 
completed identification and verification process  and then the call was transferred to 
collections and the notes support this. So it felt this would account for the time not on 
the call recording sent to our service.  
Our investigator looked into this matter. But she didnt recommend that we uphold this 
complaint. This is because she didnt feel she could say the business were  wrong  to transfer 
Mrs Rs account to D. She explained:
-On 2 May 2018, the agent confirmed:
Ref: DRN57612942oShe was able to agree  a repayment plan of £134.83 to start when Mrs R was 
paid at the end of the month.  But she wasn't  able to do this on 2 May 2018 as 
it was too far in advance.
o(at the end of the call) Mrs R would need  to contact NewDay within 2-3 weeks 
to arrange for the repayment plan to be set up. 
-Mrs Rs account  was passed  to D on 17 May 2018. However, as Mrs R didnt contact 
NewDay on or before 23 May 2018  (being 3 weeks from the date of her call to it on 2 
May), the date NewDay Ltd passed her account  to D hasnt affected the outcome of 
this complaint.
-NewDays  terms and conditions confirm it can pass the debt to a debt collection 
agency (DCA).  This is even where there are notes on the system regarding  a 
repayment arrangement. 
-The call notes the business  has provided match with the call recordings sent to our 
service by NewDay.
But Mrs R disagreed. She feels NewDay has given her the run around.  She says:
-NewDay  made a verbal agreement with her and then deleted the evidence  from the 
recording. She says theres also a further  part of the call missing  where the call 
handler said if she went for a repayment  option over 6 months,  the card limit would 
be reduced and that is why Mrs R was keen to clear it quickly  to keep the limit intact.  
-When  she spoke  to someone  on 26 May at NewDay, she was told it had written 
confirmation on the system to state a payment plan had been discussed  and that she 
was due to call at the end of the month.
-NewDay  didn't take into account the verbal  agreement before passing the debt to D.
-The date that D was appointed is critical as it shows NewDay had no intention  of 
waiting three weeks. She feels  NewDay decided to ignore  the verbal agreement  and 
acted prior to this in order to sabotage this on purpose.
-NewDay  hasnt apologised for the following matters  of poor service:
oIt told her the debt was sold on to D but actually D is collecting the debt on 
NewDays behalf. 
oNewDay said payments were held with D and came across once a month  
even though shed told NewDay that shed paid using its app so the payment 
couldnt have  gone over to D.
oMrs Rs original complaint wasnt logged or escalated correctly  when she first 
raised it with NewDay during her first call on 26 May 2018.
Our investigator and Mrs R have communicated  about these points but our investigators  
view in this complaint hasnt changed  as a result. 
Mrs R asked that the ombudsman listen to a recording of a call when  she spoke to D about 
the issues she was facing with NewDay. Having now received this recording, the matter has 
been passed to me for a decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Where theres a dispute about  what 
happened, Ive based my decision on what I thinks more likely to have happened  in light of 
the evidence.
Ref: DRN57612943Although a number  of issues  have been raised,  this decision only addresses those issues 
I consider to be materially relevant to this complaint. However, Ive given careful 
consideration to all of the submissions made before arriving at my decision.
Having done so, I have to tell Mrs R that I think the adjudicator has reached the right 
outcome here. So I dont  uphold her complaint against NewDay. I think our investigator has 
explained matters  well and so theres  not much I feel I can usefully add. I would just make  
the following  points.
phone recordings
For me to be able to agree with what Mrs R has said about the length of the call on 2 May 
and the conversation she says is missing from it, I have to accept, for example, that:
1.NewDay has tampered  with the call recording before sending it to our service;
2.NewDays explanation  for the missing time  the identification and verification 
process at the beginning of the call  isnt reasonable;
3.NewDays call notes  which reflect the content of the call recording sent to our 
service  have also been  tampered  with or happened  to exclude the details Mrs R is 
now seeking to rely on; 
4.That 2 minutes and 43 seconds  is enough time to cover the identification  process, 
waiting time for the call to be answered  as well as the two conversations  Mrs R says 
are missing from the call; and
5.At no time during the call recording weve been  sent, does Mrs R correct the call 
handler about the time frame of calling back in 2  3 weeks  time even though  she 
says theyd actually  agreed - during  the portion of the recording which she says is 
missing - that this would be the 31 May.
And  whilst I recognise this will be disappointing  for Mrs R - I just dont agree I can 
reasonably or fairly say this is more likely  to be what happened here. 
I say this particularly  when I dont agree that NewDay  has anything  to gain. This is because, 
even if agreed that  which  I dont accept is the case here  a repayment plan had been set 
up during this call or the call itself had been  tampered with, NewDay would still have the right 
to pass on the debt to a DCA. Ill explain this below.
debt collection agencies
When companies are finding  it difficult to recover the money theyve lent they often ask other  
companies, DCAs, who specialise in debt collection,  to help them  to do so. Sometimes  
these companies are assisting the original finance provider and sometimes  the debt is sold 
to them  and they take over its management.  Here,  NewDay instructed D to help it recover 
the debt. NewDay  is still the owner  of it. 
This can be frustrating for the customer and I can understand that Mrs R may feel NewDay  
hasnt been transparent by passing  her debt to D when she was going to call back and start 
a repayment plan. Having said this, at the end of the phone  call on 2 May 2018, Mrs R was 
told that shed  need to call back in 2  3 weeks to set up the repayment  plan although  the 
quote had been saved  to the system. So I think it was clear that Mrs R had been told it 
hadnt been set up at that point and shed  need  to do something  further   call back  NewDay  
within 2  3 weeks  - before it was set up.
Ref: DRN57612944But, I also think its important to note that, even if a repayment plan had been set up  which 
I dont accept had happened here - NewDay would still have the right to pass  on the debt to 
a DCA. This is because  the terms of Mrs Rs agreement with NewDay say:
We may transfer any or all of our rights or duties under this agreement  to another  
organisation We may also arrange for any other  person  to carry out our rights or 
duties under this agreement .
This allows NewDay to pass the debt to another company, such as D, for it to help collect 
the money due. This can be done at any time during the relationship.  And this is what  
NewDay did here. So I dont think NewDay did anything wrong when it passed Mrs Rs debt 
to D for recovery when it did.
Finally, I dont uphold  Mrs Rs complaint about  the service NewDay  gave her. I havent seen 
sufficient evidence to say that NewDay told her the debt had been sold to D, gave her 
incorrect information about whether her payments were held by NewDay  or D and failed to 
set up or escalate the complaint when she got in touch  with it. Even so, I note that NewDay 
says it apologises  if Mrs R was given any incorrect information.
So, taking everything  into account, I dont think NewDay  needs  to do anything  to put things 
right in this matter.
I know that Mrs R will be disappointed with this outcome but my decision brings to an end 
what we  in trying to resolve her dispute  informally with NewDay  can do for her.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive given above,  my final decision is that I dont uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 1 March 2019.
