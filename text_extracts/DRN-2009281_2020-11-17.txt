The complaint
Ms M complains about the amount that shes been charged by LeasePlan UK Limited for 
damage to a car that she returned when her hire agreement ended.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator - so I wont repeat them again here. Instead, Ill focus on giving the reasons for 
my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Ms M under a hire agreement with LeasePlan that she 
signed in September 2016;
she agreed to pay an advance rental of £503.06 and then to make 35 monthly 
payments of £167.69 for the use of the car and the agreement said:
if, when the agreement ends, the Vehicle is for any reason returned in a 
condition not consistent with the performance of your obligations (fair wear 
and tear as defined by the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association 
excepted), we shall be entitled to reclaim from you a sum equivalent to the 
actual or estimated cost of repairs ;
Ms M returned the car when the agreement ended and it was inspected by 
LeasePlan in October 2019  the inspection report recorded the cars mileage as 
being 6,713 and identified damage to the car with an estimated repair cost of £370 
(and it included photos of the damage);
Ms M was charged £370 for the damage but she complained to LeasePlan and then 
to this service about the charges;
our investigator considered each charge in detail against the British Vehicle Rental 
and Leasing Association guidelines on fair wear and tear and concluded that the 
damage fell outside fair wear and tear;
Ive considered the damage identified in the inspection report, including the photos of 
the damage, and I consider that the damage is more than would reasonably be 
considered to be fair wear and tear in accordance with the British Vehicle Rental and 
Leasing Association guidelines on fair wear and tear; 
Ms M says that she only drove the car for 6,713 which boosted its value by more 
than the cost of the damage and that the car hasnt been repaired  so she shouldnt 
have to pay £370 to LeasePlan;
Ms M agreed that LeasePlan would be able to claim from her the actual or estimated 
cost of repairs - there was no requirement for the repairs to be completed and the 
value of the car will have been reduced by the damage to it;
Ms M had agreed to make the payments for the car to be supplied to her  the 
agreement included additional payments if she exceeded the annual mileage 
allowance but there was no provision for her to receive a refund of those payments 
(or a reduction in any additional charges that were due) if she drove the car for less 
than the annual mileage allowance or returned the car with a low mileage;
I consider that its fair and reasonable in these circumstances for LeasePlan to 
charge Ms M £370 for the damage identified in the inspection report and Im not 
persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable for me to require it to reduce that 
charge because the car wasnt repaired or because of the cars mileage when it was 
returned; and 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that LeasePlan has acted 
incorrectly in connection with the charge for the damage to the car so I find that it 
wouldnt be fair or reasonable for me to require it to reduce or waive the charge or to 
take any other action in response to Ms Ms complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Ms Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 December 2020.
