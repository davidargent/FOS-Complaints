The complaint
Mr G has complained about loans granted to him by Elevate Credit International Limited 
trading as Sunny (Sunny or the lender). He says the loans were unaffordable and should 
not have been agreed. 
What happened
Sunny agreed 27 loans for Mr G from May 2015 to November 2017. The loans were all 
instalment loans to be repaid over six months and ranged in value from £100 to £550. The 
below table sets out some  information Sunny has provided about these loans (with numbers 
rounded to the nearest pound). As the table shows many of the loans ran concurrently and 
all were repaid.

Our adjudicator upheld Mr Gs complaint in part and recommended that Sunny refund all of 
the interest and charges he paid on loans 6 to 27.
Sunny disagreed with this recommendation but offered to refund interest and charges on 
loans 18 to 27  because, it said, we consider it may have been prudent to have done things 
differently after we granted his seventeenth loan; due to Mr. [G] being in a lending 
relationship with us for a year at this point, coupled with an increase in capital and his 
pattern of borrowing over time, I believe we could have asked further questions to establish 
the state of Mr. [G]s finances at this time.
Mr G didnt accept this offer and so the complaint has come to me, as an ombudsman, to 
resolve. I issued my provisional decision on 17 April 2020 explaining why I was thinking of 
coming to a different view of Mr Gs complaint to that of our adjudicator, and provisionally 
found that Sunny shouldnt have agreed credit for him from loan 8 onwards. 
Mr G acknowledged my provisional decision and said that he had nothing further to add. 
Sunny did not respond. If Mr G accepts my final decision, it will be legally binding on the 
parties.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive reconsidered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaintAs before, I have also taken into account 
the law, any relevant regulatory rules and good industry practice at the time.
As neither party have provided anything further for consideration, I see no need to depart 
from my provisional conclusions but for completeness I will set them out again.  
The Financial Conduct Authority was the regulator when Mr G took out his loans. The 
relevant rules and guidance set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook said that for all loans 
Sunny needed to check that Mr G could afford to meet his repayments in a sustainable 
manner. This meant Mr G being able to meet his repayments out of his normal income 
without having to go without or borrow further.
The regulations werent prescriptive about what checks Sunny needed to carry out in order 
to reasonably assess whether or not Mr G would be able to meet his repayments 
sustainably. But the regulations said that such checks needed to be proportionate. 
This suggests that the same checks might not be the appropriate thing to do for all 
consumers, or for the same consumer in all circumstances.
In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed checksthe lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny says it asked Mr G for information about his income and expenses each time he 
applied for a loan. The lender recorded Mr Gs monthly income as £2,300 when he first 
applied, which increased to over £2,600 for later loans. It recorded his monthly expenses as 
ranging from approximately £800 to £1,400. Sunny also said that it used information from 
third party credit reference agencies to ensure the loans were affordable for Mr G and to 
check his credit history, though it hasnt provided the results of these checks.
Mr G hasnt provided his credit file or any bank statements, so I have limited information 
about his financial situation or how he was managing any existing credit commitments. Even 
if I found that Sunny ought to have carried out more comprehensive checks before lending to 
Mr G, I dont have enough information to determine what the lender might have found out 
about his circumstances and whether it would have declined to lend to him at any point. And 
looking at everything in the round, I havent seen any strong indications in the information 
I do have to suggest that Sunny should have declined to lend to Mr G in the months before 
January 2016. However, I think it ought to have stopped lending to him from this point for the 
following reasons.
Mr G took out 7 loans between May and December 2015. There was a gap of about five 
weeks between him repaying loan 3 and taking out loan 4 but apart from that hed been 
continuously indebted to Sunny over this time. From the information Sunny provided, Mr G 
took out £750 altogether across his first three loans. When he repaid these, he took out 
another £650 across another three loans. When he repaid one of these, he took out another 
loan (loan 7) a few days after repaying a previous loan, so he was now repaying £700 
across three loans. When he asked for loan 8, the day he repaid a previous loan, it was the 
largest amount (£400) hed applied for since his first loan. And loan 6 was still running 
so once again Mr G was repaying a debt of £650 to Sunny. It doesnt seem to me that he 
made inroads into his debt in seven months of borrowing.
The purpose of short term lending is intended to address a temporary shortfall in income. In 
Mr Gs case, the emerging pattern of borrowing continuously and taking out further credit just 
after making repayments is suggestive of someone who has an ongoing need for credit not 
just a temporary shortfall in income. Sunny has also said that Mr G repaid all his loans, 
sometimes early. Successfully repaying loans however, doesnt necessarily equate to being 
able to repay them sustainably, in other words without having to borrow again or go without.
Sunny offered to refund the interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 18 onwards because it 
said it recognised that the amount he needed to borrow was increasing, that hed been 
borrowing for over a year at that point and it took into account his pattern of borrowing. I 
agree that it was irresponsible to have agreed these loans but I also think Sunny should 
have stopped lending to Mr G before then, specifically when he asked for his eighth loan 
in January 2016. Hed been almost continuously in debt to Sunny for about seven months by 
then and I think at that point, if not before, the pattern of lending itself indicated that Mr G 
wasnt managing to repay his loans in a sustainable way. I think Sunny should have 
recognised this and declined to lend to him.I think Mr G lost out when Sunny agreed loan 8 and went on to agree more loans for him for 
almost two years because these loans unfairly prolonged his indebtedness and allowed him 
to take expensive credit intended for short term use over an extended period of time. The 
number of loans and length of time he borrowed over was likely to be seen negatively by 
other lenders, potentially keeping him in the market for high cost loans.
Putting things right
As Ive explained above, I find that Sunny was irresponsible to have agreed further credit for 
Mr G from and including his eighth loan taken out on the 4 January 2016. In order to put 
things right for him, Sunny should
refund all interest and charges Mr G paid on loans 8 to 27;and
pay interest on all these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to 
the dates of settlement; and
remove all information about these loans from Mr Gs credit file because any 
information recorded about them is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must 
give Mr G a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
As Ive explained, Im upholding Mr Gs complaint about Elevate Credit International Limited 
trading as Sunny and require it to put things right for him as Ive set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 June 2020.
