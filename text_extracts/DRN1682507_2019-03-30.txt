K820x#14complaint
Mr G complains that MMP Financial Limited  (trading as SwiftSterling) gave him loans that he 
couldnt afford to repay.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in the provisional decision I issued in 
February 2019. An extract from this is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I will 
not repeat  that information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I didnt think the complaint should be upheld. 
I invited both parties to let me have any further  comments and evidence. SwiftSterling has 
not provided us with anything further. Mr G provided  us with some  comments. Although I am 
only summarising here what Mr G has said, I have considered his entire response carefully 
before writing this decision. 
Mr G has said that each  time he borrowed he repaid the loan early  and then asked for an 
even larger  loan. That should have shown his financial hardship  was becoming worse.  He 
says his pattern  of borrowing  should  have shown that the loans werent  being  taken to meet  
one off emergency situations. And he says that the final loan was double the amount of his 
first loan. By that time he thinks SwiftSterling should have been asking him for copies  of his 
bank statements and these would have shown the extent of his financial problems.
Mr G also points out that a credit  card was more than six months in arrears  for the whole 
time he was borrowing from SwiftSterling. He says that credit card defaulted in early  2017 
and this should have been  seen from an enhanced credit  check.  This, along  with the other 
credit commitments  on his records, should  have  shown SwiftSterling that the loans were 
unaffordable for him.
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Having done so I still dont think  the 
complaint should  be upheld.
I explained in my provisional decision  why the information a lender receives from a credit  
check might  be different to that seen by a consumer checking their own file. And so I cant 
reasonably hold SwiftSterling responsible for information it didnt receive  as part of its credit 
check. As I noted  in my provisional decision that was also information  that Mr G didnt share  
with the lender when he was asking to borrow.
Mr Gs pattern of borrowing should  have caused  some concerns to SwiftSterling. I entirely 
agree with what Mr G has said about the loan amounts increasing, and the repetitive  nature 
of his borrowing. But what I need to assess here is whether I think  the checks SwiftSterling  
did were proportionate. There will be times when a pattern  of borrowing does lead me to 
think a lender needed to do the checks suggested  by Mr G, and seek  independent 
verification of a consumers financial  situation. In this case,  I think  SwiftSterling was very 
close to reaching that point. But on balance  I think it fell just short, and so I have concluded 
that the checks it did were  sufficient.
Ref: DRN16825072I appreciate that my decision is disappointing  for Mr G. But I think  the checks  SwiftSterling 
did before  agreeing each loan were proportionate.  And as those  checks suggested that Mr G 
could afford  to make the required repayments  each  month I dont think  SwiftSterling was 
wrong to give these loans to him.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, and in my provisional  decision, I dont  uphold  the complaint or 
make any award against MMP Financial Limited.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 April 2019..

complaint
Mr G complains that MMP Financial Limited (trading  as SwiftSterling) gave him loans that he couldnt  
afford to repay.
background
Mr G was given four loans by SwiftSterling between January and December  2017.  Each of the loans  
was repayable in monthly instalments as shown below.  All of Mr Gs loans were  repaid early.  A 
summary of his borrowing from SwiftSterling is as follows;
Loan 
NumberBorrowing Date Repayment  DateLoan 
Amount Number  of

1 13/01/2017 04/04/2017 £    575 6
2 02/06/2017 30/08/2017 £    750 4
3 02/09/2017 20/12/2017 £    750 4
4 27/12/2017 05/02/2018 £ 1,000 5
Mr Gs complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He thought  that the checks  
SwiftSterling had done before agreeing  the first two loans had been proportionate.  But he thought  
SwiftSterling should have  done more  checks before agreeing the last two loans. And he thought  that 
better checks would have  shown  SwiftSterling that the final loan was unaffordable for Mr G. So he 
asked SwiftSterling to pay Mr G some compensation.
SwiftSterling didnt agree with that assessment.  So, as the complaint hasnt  been resolved informally, 
it has been  passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and 
good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
SwiftSterling was required  to lend responsibly. It needed  to make checks to see whether  Mr G could  
afford to pay back each  loan before it lent to him. Those checks  needed to be proportionate to things 
such as the amount Mr G was borrowing,  and his lending history, but there was no set list of checks 
SwiftSterling had to do.
SwiftSterling has told us about the checks it did before  lending to Mr G. Before agreeing  each loan it 
asked him for details of his income, and his normal  monthly expenditure. It also checked Mr Gs credit 
file before agreeing each  loan and says that before the last loan this check included a real time review 
of any other  short term borrowing that Mr G had taken. SwiftSterling says that it was aware from its 
credit checks that Mr G had faced some financial problems  in 2011. But it says these  werent 
sufficient to cause it any additional concerns given  their age. Mr G says that SwiftSterling should also 
have seen that he had defaulted on a credit card in early 2017.
Generally, the information  a consumer might see, when they request a copy of their credit file, might 
be very different  to that seen by a lender.  A lender  might only see a small portion  of the credit file, or 
some data might be missing or anonymised, or the data might not be up to date. So, this may explain  
any differences between the information SwiftSterling received from its credit checks  and the 
information seen by Mr G in his credit report.
Ref: DRN16825074Each of Mr Gs loans was repayable in monthly instalments. So the amounts that Mr G needed  to 
repay each  time were smaller than if hed taken a normal payday loan. But of course  he was 
committing to making  those  repayments over a longer period.
Before agreeing each loan SwiftSterling asked  Mr G about his income  and expenditure. It then used 
this to calculate  the disposable income  that Mr G had each month to repay  any borrowing.  And at the 
time of the final loan SwiftSterling says it made sure that what  Mr G had declared about  his credit 
expenditure matched  what its credit  check showed. Each time he borrowed Mr G told SwiftSterling 
that he had a substantial amount of disposable income  he said he had £1,664 left over each month 
at the time of his first three loans, and £2,035 left over when he applied for the final loan.
The amounts that Mr G needed to repay on each loan were relatively  modest compared to the 
disposable income  that hed declared  to SwiftSterling.  I have considered that Mr G borrowed regularly 
from SwiftSterling  and often took a new loan within just a few days  of the early repayment of this 
previous loan. I think SwiftSterling should  have  become  increasingly concerned about that pattern  of 
behaviour. But on balance I think it was reasonable  here for the lender to rely on the information Mr G 
provided about his disposable income  and conclude  that the loans were affordable for him.
I can see that Mr Gs financial situation was far worse than he declared  to the lender. He was 
borrowing heavily from other short term lenders  loans  that he was already committed to repaying  at 
the same time as his loans from SwiftSterling. But that wasnt something he told the lender when he 
asked for the loans. And I dont think it was something that what  I consider to be proportionate checks 
here would  have discovered. I dont think SwiftSterling needed to go further than the checks it did, 
and those suggested that the loans  were affordable. So I dont think  SwiftSterling was wrong to give 
these loans to Mr G.
