The complaint
Mr B complains about delays caused by National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) when 
dealing with a request to close accounts for the estate of the late Miss B. The complaint has 
been brought by a representative  who Ill refer to as company P. Mr B wants NatWest to 
pay compensation and company Ps fees which have accrued due to NatWests failures in 
service.    
 
What happened
Company P received instructions to handle the estate of the late Miss B. There were three 
NatWest accounts held by Miss B, two were in her own name and another was in the name 
of a business of which Miss B was the sole director and shareholder. In dealing with the 
administration of the estate, company P requested the closure of these accounts. 
The business account was closed and the proceeds were paid to company P. In relation to 
the other accounts, NatWest werent accepting documentation provided by company P so 
they couldnt send the proceeds. Company P complained to NatWest about delays in closing 
the business account and NatWests handling of the personal account  and in particular, 
their refusal to accept identification documentation. NatWest responded and accepted there 
had been errors in the service they provided so they apologised and offered £200 
compensation. NatWest didnt uphold the part of the complaint relating to their refusal to 
accept the identification documentation.    
Our investigator looked into things for Mr B. He thought there had been delays by Natwest in 
closing the accounts and they had given contradictory information to company P. Our 
investigator felt it was reasonable for NatWest to increase the compensation to £350. Mr B 
disagreed so the matter has come to me for a decision.    
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Ive decided to uphold the complaint. I agree with the investigators view on 
compensation and understand Mr B will be disappointed by this but Ill explain why I have 
made this decision. 
Business account
I can see a representative at company P became a director of the late Miss Bs company so 
they could make the necessary arrangements with NatWest to close the business account. 
The process appears to have started in August 2019 and continued through September with 
a visit to a branch in early September to provide identification documents and a phone call 
later in the month with NatWest. 
There was then a phone call between company P and NatWest in October during which the 
representative at company P was told they would need to complete an account closure form. 
I can see this was completed and submitted to NatWest on 31 October. The account was 
then closed and the proceeds sent to company P on 17 December.
   
I can see from contact notes provided by NatWest that process arrangements were being 
made in relation to closing this account. I can also see that company P were chasing to find 
out why the account hadnt been closed. And a complaint was raised by company P on 16 
December because they were told the previous week that NatWest would fast track this and 
the account would be closed in three working days. 
From the information Ive seen, I think there has been delays here. I havent seen any 
evidence which shows that NatWest explained to company P, during discussions in 
September, that they would need to complete an account closure form. And, once this was 
completed, it took over six weeks for the account to be closed. I do appreciate a bank must 
follow a process when closing an account so it cant be done immediately. But, in this case, 
while I have taken account of that, I havent seen any evidence or explanation for why it took 
six weeks to close the account after receipt of the closure form.
  
Personal accounts   
The process to close these accounts started in July 2019 with company P submitting 
documents. NatWest responded about a month later and asked for a Grant of Probate. 
Company P then sent NatWest a closure form signed by the late Miss Bs next of kin, Mrs B, 
in early September. Around three weeks later, NatWest said it was necessary to verify the 
identity of the next of kin and set out details on what company P needed to do. As Mrs B 
lived abroad, one of the options was for her to take an original document to an overseas 
lawyer or attorney to certify. In early October, company P sent NatWest a copy of Mrs Bs 
passport certified by an overseas lawyer. Around four weeks later, NatWest responded to 
say they needed a closure form. This was the form company P had already sent in early 
September. I think there was an error here by NatWest in asking for information which they 
had already received. 
    
Over the next few months, I can see correspondence was exchanged between company P 
and NatWest in which NatWest say they couldnt verify the overseas lawyer. Company P 
provided further information showing the overseas lawyers qualifications but on two further 
occasions NatWest said they still couldnt verify the overseas lawyer. During this time, 
company P raised a complaint about the service received. In February 2020, company P 
sent NatWest a copy of Mrs Bs passport certified by a different overseas lawyer and the 
accounts were closed in April.   
I understand company P are concerned about why NatWest werent able to verify the first 
overseas lawyer to certify Mrs Bs passport. Its reasonable and appropriate for a business to 
have a verification process in place for such cases. So, I dont think it was unreasonable for 
NatWest to say they cant accept the documents they had received which had been certified 
by the first overseas lawyer. NatWest have a process in place and they explained the 
documents didnt meet their requirements of acceptable identification. While we cant tell a 
business what their processes should be, its reasonable for a business to give guidance to a 
consumer where they send in documents which a business says arent acceptable. That 
hasnt happened here. I do appreciate why Mr Bs representative at company P was 
frustrated as I cant see they were told at any point what the issue was with verifying the first 
overseas lawyer. So, while NatWest are well within their rights to decline to accept 
documents in line with their processes, I think they couldve done more to help company P 
understand the reasons  particularly so as company P had provided further information 
proving the first overseas lawyers qualifications.    
During the process of closing these accounts there have been delays. NatWest often took 
several weeks to respond to documents sent by company P and, when looking at this cumulatively, it does show a few months delay which I think was avoidable. Company P are 
handling the administration of an estate so, understandably, they have clients who are upset 
and distressed and would want to see matters resolved swiftly. That hasnt happened here 
and NatWest took too long to provide company P with an answer following receipt of 
documents. So, I do uphold this part of the complaint relating to the delay in closing all three 
accounts. And, I think its fair for NatWest to pay compensation to the late Miss Bs estate.  
The delays have had an impact on the estate of the late Miss B with the estate being 
inconvenienced by not being able to distribute the account proceeds to the beneficiary 
sooner. I think compensation of £350 (inclusive of the £200 already offered) is fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances. 
I can see company P have provided a summary of the fees incurred by the estate of the late 
Miss B  which they say are as a result of NatWests errors. While I dont disagree there 
have been delays Im sorry to disappoint Mr B but Im not persuaded it would be fair to tell 
NatWest to pay for all or part of the fees incurred. The summary of the fees doesnt provide 
a full narrative of the work done but I can see the dates are from December 2019 to 
February 2020. Ive looked at the correspondence relating to this period and can see 
company P raised complaints with NatWest and were also engaging with them about 
verifying the first overseas lawyer. A company dealing with the administration of an estate 
will incur costs when arranging to close accounts  this is part of the process in winding up 
an estate. So, I dont think its fair to expect NatWest to meet any fees incurred in raising a 
complaint. In addition to this, NatWest had explained to company P there was an issue with 
verifying the first overseas lawyer so there was an option for company P to arrange for 
another lawyer to certify Mrs Bs passport  which is what they did in February 2020. So, I 
dont think its reasonable for NatWest to pay the fees incurred. 
I can see company P are unhappy about issues during the complaints process. Complaint 
handling isnt a regulated or other covered activity. So as a general rule, and in line with the 
law, if the complaint is solely about complaint handling, we wouldnt be able to look into 
things. Where complaint handling forms a part of a customers complaint, then we can take it 
into account when looking at the overall customer experience. In this case, company P say 
there were delays in the complaint handling and NatWest didnt respond to emails, so I think 
the complaint handling is an extension of the problems caused by the original failing. So, I 
have factored this into my decision and feel the £350 compensation Im asking NatWest to 
pay also covers these failings.   
Putting things right
Ive decided there has been delays by NatWest as well as other errors which Ive mentioned 
in my decision. So, I think its fair and reasonable for NatWest to pay compensation. Theyve 
offered £200, but I dont think this reflects the impact and inconvenience to the estate. So, 
NatWest should increase this offer to £350 which should be paid to the late Miss Bs estate.  
My final decision
My decision is that I uphold this complaint and direct National Westminster Bank Plc to pay 
the estate of the late Miss B compensation of £350.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B and the 
estate of Miss B to accept or reject my decision before 8 March 2021.
