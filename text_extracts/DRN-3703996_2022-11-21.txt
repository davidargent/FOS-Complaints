The complaint
Mr D is unhappy that PayrNet Limited blocked his account after he deposited £500 in it 
and wont return the money to him following his subsequent decision to close the account.
What happened
Mr D opened an account with PayrNet in September 2021 and deposited £500 into the 
account. PayrNet then blocked the account and requested identity verification 
documents from Mr D in order for the account to be unblocked. Mr D provided the 
documents that PayrNet requested, but PayrNet didnt accept the documents and 
requested them again.
Mr D then exercised his right to close the account and requested that the £500 
deposited into the account be reimbursed back to him. PayrNet didnt process Mr Ds 
request for the reimbursement. So, Mr D raised a complaint.
PayrNet looked at Mr Ds complaint. They explained they had reimbursed the money back 
to Mr D, and so they didnt uphold Mr Ds complaint. Mr D wasnt satisfied with PayrNets 
response, so he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at this complaint. During their investigation, it transpired 
that PayrNet had successfully reimbursed a small amount of the money to Mr D, but 
£498.50 remained unaccounted for.
Our investigator didnt feel that it was fair that Mr D hadnt received the full reimbursement 
of his money from PayrNet. So, they recommended that this complaint be upheld in Mr Ds 
favour and that PayrNet should reimburse the remaining £498.50 to Mr D along with 8% 
simple interest. Our investigator also recommended that PayrNet make a further payment 
of £150 to Mr D as compensation for the trouble and upset this ongoing matter had caused.
PayrNet didnt meaningfully respond to the reiterated view of this complaint put forwards by 
our investigator, despite numerous requests from our investigator for them to do so. So, this 
matter was escalated to an ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint on 6 September 2022 as follows:
Im satisfied that Mr D was entitled to request the closure of his PayrNet account, 
and a full reimbursement of the money held therein. Im also similarly satisfied 
that despite Mr D making that request almost a year ago, PayrNet still havent 
reimbursed the majority of Mr Ds money to him.
PayrNet have explained that the outstanding £498.50 was reimbursed back to Mr 
D on 24 January 2022 and have provided the account details that the money was 
sent to. These account details do correspond with an account owned by Mr D, but 
Mr D has provided statements of that account which confirm that the £498.50 that 
PayrNet believe was successfully sent wasnt received into that account. And 
having reviewed these statements, Im satisfied that the £498.50 wasnt received 
by Mr D into that account and that as such that the £498.50 remains outstanding 
for PayrNet to reimburse to Mr D.
Our investigator explained to PayrNet that Mr Ds account statements confirmed 
that the £498.50 hadnt been received into that account as PayrNet believed, and 
reiterated their position that PayrNet should arrange the reimbursement of that 
amount back to Mr D at the earliest opportunity, along with 8% simple interest 
and a further compensation payment of £150.
Since that time, which was several months ago, PayrNet havent engaged with 
this service in any meaningful way, despite numerous requests from our 
investigator for them to do so. This is poor service by any reasonable standard, 
and Im satisfied that Mr D, who still hasnt received his £498.50 back from 
PayrNet, has incurred ongoing upset and inconvenience as a direct result.
PayrNet may contend that they did reimburse Mr D in January 2022 and have 
provided confirmation of that to this service. But as explained previously, Mr D 
has provided evidence which confirms to my satisfaction that he didnt receive 
that payment. And I feel that the issue of where the £498.50 payment that 
PayrNet made in January 2022 is now is an issue for PayrNet themselves to 
resolve. Whats important here is that Mr D hasnt been reimbursed by PayrNet 
as he fairly should have been.
As such, my provisional decision is that Im upholding this complaint in Mr Ds 
favour and instructing PayrNet to reimburse the outstanding £498.50 to Mr D at 
the earliest opportunity, along with 8% simple interest calculated on that amount 
from the date that Mr D first opened the PayrNet account to the date PayrNet 
make the reimbursement payment as instructed.
Additionally, given the significant amount of time that this matter has 
remained unresolved, which I feel PayrNet should bear the sole 
accountability for, Im also instructing PayrNet to make an increased further 
payment to Mr D of £500 as compensation for the distress and trouble that 
this ongoing matter has caused.
Following the issuance of a final decision on this complaint, PayrNet must pay this
£500 compensation within 28-days of the date that this service tells them that Mr 
D accepts that final decision. If PayrNet pays the £500 compensation to Mr D 
later than 28-days after their being notified that Mr D accepts the final decision, 
then PayrNet must also pay 8% simple interest on this £500 compensation, 
calculated from the date of the final decision to the date of payment.
In structuring the compensation payable to Mr D in such a way, I hope to 
prompt PayrNet into doing what I can only conclude they should have done 
many months
ago  which is to reimburse Mr Ds money back to him, along with interest 
and compensation, at the earliest possible opportunity.In response to my provisional decision, PayrNet explained that they had attempted to return 
the £498.50 to Mr D but that the attempted payment had failed. PayrNet therefore proposed 
that they return the money to Mr D at the earliest opportunity and provide £150 
compensation to Mr D in line with recommendation made by our investigator in April 2022, 
before this complaint was escalated to me. PayrNet also commented that they didnt feel 
that the increase in the compensation amount to £500 was reasonable and asked for my 
comments on why I had provisionally instructed such an increase.
In regard to PayrNets first point, as explained in my provisional decision, Mr D has 
provided bank statements which correspond to the sort-code and account number that 
PayrNet attempted to make the payment too, and these statements confirm the sort-code 
and account number as being correct and show no receipt of the £498.50. And, as per my 
provisional decision, it remains my position that it was incumbent on PayrNet to have made 
further efforts to have returned the money to Mr D, especially given Mr Ds ongoing 
complaint about not having received that money.
As also explained in my provisional decision letter, I feel that PayrNets sustained failure to 
return Mr Ds money to him over a prolonged period of time, including several months 
during which PayrNet failing to meaningfully engage with this service while we attempted to 
resolve this issue, means that Im satisfied that Mr D has incurred an ongoing amount of 
unnecessary upset and inconvenience for which I can only reasonably conclude PayrNet 
should be held accountable for.
As such, I dont feel that the £150 compensation amount previously recommended by our 
investigator does provide fair compensation to Mr D for the totality of whats happened 
here, and it remains my position that compensation of £500, with the possibility of 
additional interest on that amount, is fair compensation here, for the reasons explained 
above.
All of which means I see no reason not to uphold this complaint on the basis as previously 
outlined in my provisional decision letter, and I can confirm that I do uphold this complaint 
on that basis accordingly.
As previously explained, the bank account the Mr D used to pay money into the PayrNet 
account is now closed. Its my understanding that PayrNet have already been provided 
alternative account details to make the payments provisionally instructed above, 
although these account details will also be provided to PayrNet in a separate cover.
Putting things right
PayrNet must reimburse the outstanding £498.50 to Mr D at the earliest opportunity, 
along with 8% simple interest calculated on that amount from the date that Mr D first 
opened the PayrNet account to the date PayrNet make the reimbursement payment as 
instructed.
PayrNet must also make a further payment to Mr D of £500 as compensation for the 
distress and trouble that this ongoing matter has caused.
PayrNet must pay this £500 compensation within 28-days of the date that this service tells 
them that Mr D accepts that final decision. If PayrNet pays the £500 compensation to Mr D 
later than 28-days after their being notified that Mr D accepts the final decision, then 
PayrNet must also pay 8% simple interest on this £500 compensation, calculated from the 
date of the final decision to the date of payment.My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayrNet Limited on the basis 
explained above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr D to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 October 2022.
