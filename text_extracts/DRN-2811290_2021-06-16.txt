The complaint
Mr G complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA (PayPal) acted unfairly when it agreed 
to make a refund to one of his customers. He also complains that PayPal acted unfairly 
when it refused to refund him for a purchase hed made using his PayPal account.
What happened
Mr G had a PayPal account which he used as his payment account when buying and selling 
goods online. He says he sold a gift card online and received payment into his account in 
August 2020. He says the buyer then raised a fake claim with PayPal and said that the item 
was not as described. Mr G says that PayPal refunded the buyer and made a report about 
Mr G to police.  Mr G says that because the item hed sold was a gift card, PayPal shouldnt 
have accepted the request for refund since gift cards are not eligible under PayPals Buyer 
Protection provisions.
Mr G also says he made a purchase using his PayPal account on 24 August 2020. He says 
he returned the item because it was significantly not as described. He made a claim under 
PayPals Buyer Protection provisions, but he says it denied his claim. He complained to 
PayPal.
PayPal investigated his complaint. It said it had written to Mr G on 25 August 2020 to tell him 
that because he had breached the terms and conditions in its User Agreement it had 
decided he could no longer use its services. It said it had limited his account so he could no 
longer send or receive money using his PayPal account. It also said he could no longer bring 
claims under its Purchase Protection and any existing claims would be denied. 
PayPal said its User Agreement allowed it to suspend eligibility for both its Buyer Protection 
and Seller Protection  including in retrospect. It said it believed hed engaged in restricted 
activities and it didnt have to disclose details of its risk management or security procedures 
to him. It didnt uphold his complaint.
Mr G didnt agree. He referred his complaint to our service. Our investigator looked into his 
complaint. She said hed received a payment on 2 August 2020. The buyer had raised a 
claim saying that the goods were significantly not as described. On 25 August Mr G had 
been notified about PayPals decision that he had breached the User Agreement. As a 
result, PayPal had limited his account and his ability to file both Buyer and Seller Protection 
cases (including in retrospect) had been removed. On 25 October 2020 PayPal had closed 
his dispute about the sale of the gift card, in favour of the buyer. She also noted that PayPal 
Seller Protection didnt cover gift cards. So, she thought PayPal hadnt made an error.
Mr G didnt agree. He reiterated that gift cards were not eligible for Buyer Protection in the 
User Agreement. So, he said PayPal shouldve rejected the claim.
Our investigator didnt change her view. So, the complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive looked firstly at the User Agreement which Mr G accepted when he opened his account 
with PayPal. The User Agreement set out a number of actions which PayPal could take if it 
believed that Mr G had engaged in certain restricted activities. These included PayPals right 
to:
Terminate the user agreement, limit the account and/or close or suspend the 
account, immediately and without penalty to PayPal;
Refuse to provide PayPal services to Mr G in the future;
Reverse a payment (including, if appropriate, to the senders funding source);
Suspend Mr Gs eligibility for PayPal Buyer Protection and/or PayPal seller 
Protection (including in retrospect).
 
Ive then looked at the list of restricted activities in the User Agreement. In its letter to Mr G 
dated 25 August 2020, PayPal told him hed continually filed cases that did not align with 
the intent of the PayPal Purchase Protection Program and which are contrary to the terms 
outlined in the User Agreement. 
The User Agreement says that when making decisions such as limiting or restricting an 
account, PayPal can base its decisions on confidential criteria essential to its management 
of risk and the protection of PayPal, its customers and its service providers. And I think 
PayPal is entitled to exercise its own commercial judgements when deciding whether theres 
been a breach of the User Agreement. Id still expect it to act fairly when reaching a decision 
such as the one outlined in its letter to Mr G dated 25 August 2020.
The letter of 25 August 2020 set out the reason why PayPal had made its decision.  Mr G 
told us he didnt raise any challenge to what PayPal said in its letter. He says he didnt reply 
to the letter because he cannot comment on what PayPals policy is. But, if he disagreed 
with the reason PayPal had given for its actions, I wouldve expected him to contact PayPal 
to dispute what it had said about the nature of the claims he had filed under the Purchase 
Protection programme. He didnt do that. In these circumstances Im satisfied PayPal acted 
fairly and reasonably when it proceeded to limit and restrict his account.
Mr Gs complaint is that this decision shouldnt have impacted his rights under the Buyer 
Protection provisions in the User Agreement for a purchase he made prior to 25 August 
2020. And, he says that the claim brought by a buyer, also prior to 25 August 2020, shouldnt 
have been accepted by PayPal because it related to the sale of a gift card.
I agree with Mr G when he says that the sale of gift cards isnt covered by the Buyer 
Protection provisions in the User Agreement. But that doesnt mean PayPal couldnt reverse 
the payment. As set out above, where PayPal believed that Mr G had engaged in restricted 
activities one of the actions it could take was reverse a payment. I think thats what 
happened here. And, on balance, Im satisfied that it didnt do anything wrong when it told 
him on 25 October 2020 that the dispute about the gift card had been closed in favour of the 
buyer.
Ive also thought about what Mr G has told us about a claim he raised under the Buyer 
Protection provisions in the User Agreement. That related to a purchase hed made on 24 
August 2020. He says that was before PayPal sent its letter dated 25 August 2020. So, he 
thinks its unfair that hes been denied buyer protection for an item purchased before that 
date. I can understand why Mr G might say that the letter dated 25 August 2020 shouldnt change 
anything that happened before that date. But, thats not what the User Agreement said. It 
said that when PayPal believed thered been restricted activities it could suspend eligibility 
for both Buyer and Seller Protection  including in retrospect. And, in this case Ive also 
noted that the reason PayPal gave in its letter dated 25 August 2020 for its decision was that 
Mr G had continually filed cases that didnt align with the intent of its Purchase Protection 
programme. 
In these circumstances, Im persuaded that it was acting fairly and reasonably when it told 
him that his claim under the Buyer Protection provisions of the User Agreement had also 
been denied.
Having considered everything here, I think PayPal has acted fairly and reasonably and I 
dont require it to do anything more to resolve this complaint.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I do not uphold this complaint about PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, 
SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 July 2021.
