The complaint
Mrs A complains National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) provided poor customer service 
when she attempted to change her details online and then it blocked her bank account.
What happened
Mrs A says she was unable to access her bank account details online in February 2022 and 
discovered her bank account had been blocked. Mrs A says as she knew her debit card was 
about to expire, she wanted to update NatWest with her marriage details and new address. 
Mrs A says NatWest made it difficult to do this over the telephone or online and passed her 
around various departments and also disconnected her telephone calls.  
Mrs A says she is unable to come over to the UK to provide the identification NatWest have 
asked for, as she lives overseas and has recently had a baby. Mrs A says she has provided 
the identification required by email, but NatWest have still refused to amend her surname or 
provide a new debit card and have now told her it intends to close her bank account. Mrs A 
says NatWest should allow her to send identification documentation by email to amend her 
account details and for it to increase the amount of compensation it has paid her, to £500 for 
the stress and upset this has caused her. 
NatWest says it accepts it could have provided better service to Mrs A when she contacted 
them in February 2022 and could have kept her better informed of what was happening at 
the time. NatWest says it has apologised for that and has paid Mrs A £250 to cover costs of 
phone calls and the inconvenience it caused. NatWest says it cant accept identification 
online and that must be provided either by Mrs A taking this into a local branch in the UK or 
writing to her home branch with the necessary covering legal proof of her change of name. 
Mrs A wasnt happy with NatWests response and referred the matter to this service.
The investigator looked at all the available information but didnt uphold the complaint. The 
investigator felt having listened to various telephone calls, NatWest were entitled to restrict 
the bank account, if it had any suspicions regarding the bank accounts security. The 
investigator felt NatWest had made adjustments for Mrs A when it agreed she could send 
her identification documents to her home branch by post for it to consider, rather than her 
having to travel to the UK.
The investigator felt although Mrs A had experienced some inconvenience, the 
compensation NatWest had paid for that of £250 in total was reasonable.  
Mrs A didnt agree with the investigators view and asked for the matter to be referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I wont be upholding this complaint and I will explain how I have come to my 
decision. 
I can understand it would have been frustrating for Mrs A, while living overseas, to be told 
she needed to provide identification documentation before her address and name details 
could be changed, and at the same time have her bank account blocked by NatWest. 
When looking at this complaint I will consider if NatWest acted unfairly when it blocked Mrs 
As bank account and would only amend her surname and issue a correctly designated bank 
debit card, upon receipt of legally endorsed identification documents. 
Its worth saying NatWest have accepted it could have provided a better overall service to 
Mrs A when she contacted them about her change of bank details. NatWest have in total, 
paid Mrs A £250 to cover her telephone calls and the inconvenience she faced when 
speaking to its staff. But Mrs A doesnt think this goes far enough and wants NatWest to 
change her bank details and surname, having already sent it all the documents it needs to 
do that. Mrs A feels NatWest should increase its offer to £500 and not close her bank 
account as it has recently informed her. 
While I understand the points Mrs A makes, Im not fully persuaded by her argument here. I 
say this because if NatWest felt there was a potential security issue, its not for me to tell it 
cant place a restriction on that bank account until it was fully satisfied as to the identity of its 
customer. I can see that the restriction was removed some 10 days later.
With regards to Mrs As request to change her surname following her marriage, NatWest 
asked Mrs A to visit her local branch with appropriate legal documentation to confirm this, 
but when it was informed she lived overseas, it agreed in its final response letter dated 25 
February 2022, she should send this legally endorsed identification to her home branch. 
While I understand Mrs A doesnt think that is reasonable of NatWest here and it should 
accept the email she sent to them enclosing the documents, its not for me to tell NatWest 
what documentation it must accept, after all that is its process and I cant insist it changes 
that. 
While perhaps NatWest could have initially explained its process a little clearer to Mrs A, it 
has acknowledged that and paid a total of £250 by way of payment towards her telephone 
costs and the inconvenience she has been caused. Overall, its not the role of this service to 
penalise businesses when poor service issues arise, but to ensure some redress is paid 
when it happens, and Im satisfied that it did that here. 
I understand Mrs A is also unhappy NatWest have also informed her it intends to close her 
bank account, but that didnt form part of her initial complaint to this service, as the 
investigator has pointed out, so I cant comment on this as NatWest havent been given the 
opportunity to consider or respond to this point. 
While Mrs A will be disappointed with my decision, I wont be asking anymore of NatWest.  
My final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs A to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 November 2022.
