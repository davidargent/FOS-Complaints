The complaint
Mr H complains that American Express Services Europe Limited wont refund to him the 
£100 that hes claimed for a flight booking and about the customer service that hes 
received.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Mr H used his American Express credit card in October 2019 to pay £401.23 to a 
flight booking agent for some flights to be taken later that month;
he wanted to use a promotional code from the booking agent to reduce the cost of 
the flights by £100 but he was unable to do so when booking the flights online  he 
says that the booking agent told him to pay the full price and the refund would be 
issued later;
he didnt receive the refund so he made a chargeback request to American Express 
in November 2019 but it said that it didnt have enough information to proceed with a 
chargeback; 
he provided further information to American Express but it said that there was 
insufficient evidence for it to make a chargeback claim  but it did discuss his claim 
with the booking agent;
Mr H complained to this service that a chargeback claim hadnt been made and 
about the customer service that hed received from American Express;
our investigator didnt consider that American Express had acted incorrectly in its 
handling of Mr Hs chargeback claim or that it had treated him unfairly or 
unreasonably;
Mr H says that American Express delays and poor professionalism have caused him 
distress and inconvenience and hell accept £100 compensation from it;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made but, if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made;
Mr H asked American Express to make a chargeback claim for the flights that hed 
booked but it said that he hadnt provided enough information to proceed with a claim 
 he provided it with further information but it said that there was insufficient evidence 
to make a chargeback claim;
hes provided a copy of the booking agents promotion which is for €100 (not £100) 
and which expired four days before he booked the flights - and Im not persuaded 
that he was entitled to use the promotional code for these flights or that American 
Express acted incorrectly in not making a chargeback claim in these circumstances;
Mr H clearly feels that the customer service that hes received from American 
Express hasnt been acceptable  but Im not persuaded that hes provided enough 
evidence to show that the customer service that hes received from it has been below 
a reasonably acceptable standard or that it has treated him unfairly or unreasonably; 
and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
American Express to refund to Mr H the £100 that hes claimed, to pay him any 
compensation for his issues with its customer service or to take any other action in 
response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 February 2021.
