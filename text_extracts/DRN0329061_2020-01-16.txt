K821x#15complaint
Mr W complains about an Aqua branded credit card provided to him by NewDay  Ltd. He thinks  
it was irresponsible  of NewDay  to lend to him and that it shouldnt  have  done  so.
background
In 2013 Mr W applied  for the credit card online. He says that at the time of applying  for the card 
he had numerous  payday lending accounts  with a repeat  pattern  of borrowing, plus a number of 
credit card accounts that had defaulted  or were at or over their credit limits. And he says his 
current account was in an unauthorised overdraft.
As well as the decision to provide him a credit card in the first place, Mr W also complains about 
a number of unsolicited credit limit increases  which occurred between 2014 and 2016.  These  
saw his credit limit increase from its initial level of £250 to over £3,500. 
NewDay says it carried out appropriate checks when considering Mr Ws application and when 
offering credit limit increases. It says the credit  card Mr W applied  for is designed to assist 
customers in building  or improving their credit profile. The credit  limit was reviewed every three 
or four months. And Mr W was free to decline any of the increases. Our adjudicator  didnt think 
NewDay had done anything wrong in relation  to accepting Mr Ws initial application for the credit 
card, or the first credit limit increase. But they thought  the second and later credit limit increases 
were unaffordable.  NewDay disagreed  with this, so Ive was asked to make a decision on the 
complaint. 
Mr W currently owes over £3,500 on his NewDay account. Hes in a payment arrangement  
which  if he continues  to make the agreed  repayment  will take him over five years to pay off 
the debt.
I issued a provisional decision to give Mr W and NewDay a chance  to respond to my proposals.  
To put things right I said I was planning to direct NewDay to refund interest and charges on Mr 
Ws spending and cash purchases when he owed more than £400, and to refund half of any 
remaining balance that was more than £400. 
Mr W responded to say that he accepted  my findings and agreed with my provisional decision.  
He pointed out that the interest  rate had been  increased and he wasnt  sure how much  balance 
would remain for NewDay  to write off. 
NewDay replied to say that it disagreed with writing  off any amount once the interest  and 
charges had been refunded. NewDay argued  that Mr W had the benefit of the money  he spent, 
so it feels he should still have to repay it. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and reasonable 
in the circumstances of this complaint,  including Mr Ws and NewDays responses to my 
provisional decision. Having done  so Ive decided to stick with the proposals  I set out in my 
provisional decision. 
NewDay was required to lend responsibly.  When NewDay initially provided the card to Mr W (as 
well as each time it increased his credit limit) it needed to take reasonable steps to understand 
whether Mr W would be able to repay what was being lent within a reasonable period of time. It 
Ref: DRN03290612was up to NewDay to decide exactly what checks it carried out, but they had to be proportionate  
to things such as the amount borrowed, the cost of repayment and Mr Ws borrowing history.
Having considered what checks were carried out and Mr Ws circumstances at the time of 
applying for the card and each credit limit increase, Ive decided that:
It was fair and reasonable for NewDay to accept Mr Ws application  for a credit card and 
offer the initial credit  limit of £250.
NewDay made a reasonable decision when offering the first credit limit increase  which  
increased it to £400.
The later credit limit increases were irresponsible, and Im upholding the complaint in 
relation to these.
I explain my reasons below.
offering the credit  card
Im satisfied that NewDay was aware of the main information on Mr Ws credit file and that, 
although there had been  some defaults  the most recent one was over two years before  his 
application. There had been some payday loans, but overall  there wasnt anything to suggest  
that Mr W wouldnt have been able to repay £250  within a reasonable period of time.
the first credit limit increase  to £400 in March 2014
When the first credit  limit increase was offered in early February 2014, its unclear exactly  what 
information NewDay was provided by the credit reference agency it used. But it says it 
considered that information alongside  looking at how Mr W had managed his NewDay credit 
card account. The increase  didnt take place until March 2014  and Ive considered  what  
information was most  likely available to NewDay at that time.
Mr W had kept his account up to date at that point.  On one occasion  hed slightly  exceeded his 
credit limit. But hed often paid more  than the minimum  payment due on the account. So, I dont 
think NewDay had any obvious  cause to be concerned about how Mr W was managing his 
account.
The credit report provided by Mr W (from 2017) shows that in February  2014  he had a current 
account on which hed exceeded his overdraft  limit and was at least  three months in arrears. 
And another  credit card account on which he went into arrears in January 2014  and entered a 
debt management  plan the following month. This suggests he was beginning to struggle with 
his debts.
However, these issues had only just begun  albeit his overdraft had first gone into arrears  in 
December 2013.  I think its unlikely that the more serious issues (being at least  three  months in 
arrears and in a debt management plan)  would have been shown on the credit file information  
available to NewDay when it applied the credit  limit increase in mid-March. This is because  
theres likely  to have been  a delay in this information  being reported to the credit  reference 
agencies and appearing on the information provided to NewDay. So, I dont think  the 
information NewDay is likely to have  been  able to see on Mr Ws credit report would more likely 
than not have shown that Mr W wouldnt have been  able to repay £400 within  a reasonable 
period of time.
Ref: DRN03290613So, overall, I dont  think NewDay did anything wrong in offering him the credit  limit increase or 
applying it to his account.
the later credit limit increases  July 2015  onwards
In June 2015 NewDay offered a credit limit increase from £400 to £1,150, which  it applied  in 
July 2015. This was a significant increase  almost  trebling the amount  Mr W could borrow. 
Based on the credit  report provided  by Mr W, his credit report  at that time is likely  to have 
shown the following information that shouldve been  of concern:
Mr Ws current account was in default since May 2014.
A second current account was also in default  since April 2015,  having been in arrears or 
subject to a debt management  plan since March 2014.
His other credit card was subject to an arrangement to make  reduced monthly payments 
(less than the contractual minimum) since January  2015 following a debt management 
plan that ran from February  2014 to December  2014.
I think this suggests  that Mr W had been struggling  with repaying his existing debts since at 
least March 2014.  I appreciate  that hed not gone  into arrears on his NewDay credit card. And 
he was regularly making more than the minimum contractual repayment. But his statement 
balance had been near to or over his credit limit since May 2014   just two months  after the 
previous increase. Hed also taken four modest  cash advances since the last increase. And I 
dont think that acceptable management  of his NewDay credit card meant  that NewDay  could  
overlook the other issues highlighted on his credit  report.
I think that the active defaults  and inability to keep up with his contractual repayments  on other 
accounts shouldve  been sufficient for NewDay to realise that Mr W was unlikely to be able to 
manage a significantly  higher  credit limit. And that he may struggle to repay any additional  
borrowing that he took out. I think  it was unreasonable for NewDay  to pro-actively make 
available significantly more credit  to Mr W when  he had, for over a year, been  unable to meet  
the repayment terms on three other  accounts.
I dont know if NewDay was aware of the information  on Mr Ws credit report or if it decided  to 
increase his credit limit despite this information.  But I think  NewDay shouldve  been aware  of it, 
and that it shouldnt have increased his credit limit in July 2015.  
I also think it was unreasonable of NewDay  to offer and apply  the credit  limit increases that 
followed this  in November 2015  to £2,050,  April 2016 to £2,800 and August 2016 to £3,550.
Throughout this time Mr Ws original current account was still in default. He was still paying less 
than his contractual repayments on his other credit card.  And he was in long term arrears  on a 
hire purchase agreement (since 2014). Hed also been using payday loans from various  
sources, some of which hed defaulted  on, albeit  I understand NewDay may have had limited or 
no information about his payday  loan accounts in the data it was using to make  lending 
decisions during  those times.
So, I dont think that NewDay had any reasonable basis for concluding that Mr W would be able 
to repay  any of this additional borrowing within a reasonable period of time.  These  decisions to 
extend additional credit  to Mr W seem to be especially reckless  given  the information on his 
Ref: DRN03290614credit file at those times. And as NewDay took such reckless risks when lending (in other  words  
lending when it was aware or it ought reasonably to have been aware there  was a very real 
prospect Mr W wouldnt be able to repay  any capital  advanced, let alone  the interest), I think 
that this needs  to be reflected in what NewDay does to put things right.
NewDays irresponsible lending decisions have left Mr W owing over £3,500  which it will take 
him more  than five years  to pay off. Had NewDay not increased his credit limit beyond £400,  
then he would owe significantly less than this. His overall repayments wouldve  been less, and 
his financial difficulties are unlikely to have been so great. 
While, as NewDay points  out, Mr W has had some benefit from using those additional funds, I 
think this is an exceptional case where  it would be fair and reasonable for NewDay  to write off 
some of the additional  capital Mr W owes as a result of what NewDay  did wrong. That is, of 
course, assuming  that Mr W still owes more  than £400 after NewDay has taken the action Ive 
described below under A and B. 
My reason  for deciding that NewDay  should write off some of the capital is that I think  
NewDays decisions were especially reckless in light of Mr Ws financial position when it 
increased his credit  limit beyond £400.
Mr W should keep making  the repayments that hes agreed with NewDay. If he accepts my 
decision, then once NewDay has taken the action below  (which  may take some time) then Mr W 
can speak to NewDay about whether or not the agreed repayments are still appropriate. 
putting things right
To put things right, NewDay should do the following:
A.From  the date of the July 2015 increase, NewDay  should work out the interest  charged  on 
purchases and cash  advances that Mr W made when  he owed more than £400,  plus any 
charges that were  caused by that and any interest  added to those charges.
B.Deduct the amount  in A from the outstanding balance  on Mr Ws account.
C.Write  off 50% of any amount greater  than £400 that is still owing  after taking the steps  in A 
and B.
D.Tell Mr W what its done to work  out A, B and C.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, I uphold this complaint. NewDay  Ltd should put things right by 
doing what Ive said above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr W to accept or 
reject my decision  before 16 February  2020.
