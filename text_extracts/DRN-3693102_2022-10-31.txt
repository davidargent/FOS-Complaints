The complaint
Mrs H complains that Santander UK plc wont refund to her the money that she paid for a 
car. Shes being represented in her complaint by Mrs C.
What happened
Mrs H made two payments from her Santander bank account to buy a used car from a 
dealer in October 2020. The price of the car was £3,299 and the first payment was a deposit 
of £1,000 and the second payment was for the balance of £2,299. Mrs C says that the car 
made loud banging and crashing noises in December 2020 so she contacted the dealer 
which said that she should take it to the specialist repairer that it used. Mrs C took the car to 
a different garage which said that the engine bolts had sheared off and dropped onto the 
drive shaft causing damage. She paid the garage £320 in January 2021 for it to drill out the 
bolts on the engine, replace them and replace the drive shaft.
Mrs C says that the steering warning light came on soon after shed collected the car and it 
was very difficult to steer. She says that the drive shaft is connected to the power steering 
pump and the steering issue was a further complication resulting from the faulty drive shaft. 
Mrs C then contacted Santander about a chargeback for the two payments totalling £3,299 
that Mrs H had paid for the car. 
Santander credited the £3,299 to Mrs Hs account and made a chargeback claim to the 
dealer but it defended the chargeback so Santander re-debited the £3,299 from Mrs Hs 
account. Mrs C then complained to Santander but it said that the chargeback claim had been 
declined and that no errors had been identified in its decline decision. It accepted that it 
hadnt responded to all of the questions that had been raised so it credited £50 to Mrs Hs 
account. Mrs H wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service.
Santander then said that it would be awarding Mrs H an additional £100 for the lack of clarity 
on the process. Our investigator didnt recommend that Mrs Hs complaint should be upheld. 
She said that Santander had acted as she would expect it to and had treated Mrs H fairly 
and reasonably.
Mrs C, on behalf of Mrs H, has asked for this complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. 
She says, in summary and amongst other things, that: 
goods dont need to be returned for a refund and its perfectly acceptable to inform 
the merchant that the goods are available for pick-up  and the dealer failed to pick 
the car up despite several chances offered; 
the Consumer Rights Act 2015 says that all repair costs and associated postage 
costs must be met by the merchant but the dealer failed to provide a tow to its 
preferred garage and failed to meet any repair costs;
theres no requirement for the car to be returned to a specific repair shop and the 
specialist repairer used by the dealer was too far for the car to be driven with the 
steering issue;
£320 has been paid for repair costs and the dealer has refused to pay that amount; 
and
Santander believed that the claim had good merit to go to pre-arbitration, but stated it 
didnt go to arbitration due to the fact the car wasnt returned. 
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that this complaint shouldnt be upheld for 
these reasons:
if a consumer disputes a card payment, the card issuer may be able to make a 
chargeback claim to the merchant under the relevant card scheme to try to settle the 
dispute;
theres no right for a consumer to require that a chargeback claim be made, but if the 
right to make a chargeback claim exists under the applicable scheme rules and if 
theres a reasonable prospect of success, I consider it to be good practice for a 
chargeback claim to be made; 
Santander made a chargeback claim because Mrs C said that the car was defective 
but the chargeback claim was defended by the dealer  the dealer said that it had 
been contacted by Mrs C about issues with the car in December 2020 and January 
2021 and it had said that she should take it to the specialist repairer that it used but 
she didnt do so  it also says that it was contacted by Santander about a chargeback 
in March 2021 but at no other point was it contacted regarding a refund or to discuss 
a return of the car;
Mrs C took the car to a different garage in December 2020 and it identified issues 
with the drive shaft which it then replaced and Mrs C paid £320 for the repair;
Mrs C says that that the steering warning light came on soon after shed collected the 
car and it was very difficult to steer but the dealer wouldnt collect the car and again 
said that she should take it to the specialist repairer that it used;
Mrs C says that the drive shaft is connected to the power steering pump and the 
steering issue is a further complication resulting from the faulty drive shaft;
its clear that there have been some issues with the car but it was eight years old 
when Mrs H paid for it, it had a mileage of 76,459 miles at that time, it had passed an 
MOT test in October 2020 and was sold with a one month warranty;
the warranty had expired when the issues with the car started in December 2020 
dealer and Mrs C then paid £320 for it to be repaired;
Mrs C still has the car and hasnt returned it to the dealer  she says that the car was 
made available for the dealer to pick-up and that the dealer failed to provide a tow to 
its specialist repairer  but the dealer says that at no point was it contacted by Mrs C 
or Mrs H regarding a refund or to discuss a return of the car;
I consider that it would be reasonable to expect the dealer to be given an opportunity 
to repair the car in these circumstances before any request to return it for a refund 
was made and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mrs C asked the dealer to accept 
a return of the car and to refund that payment that was made for it;the car passed an MOT test in October 2021 when its mileage was recorded as 
78,520 miles and it also passed an MOT test in July 2022 when its mileage was 
recorded as 80,649 miles;
Im not persuaded that Mrs C has provided enough evidence to show that Mrs H was 
entitled to return the car in these circumstances so Im not persuaded that it would be 
fair or reasonable for me to require Santander to refund to Mrs H the payments that 
were made for the car;
this complaint is about Santanders response to a chargeback claim for the two 
payments that were made for the car  Mrs C says that £320 has been paid for repair 
costs and the dealer has refused to pay that amount  but I dont consider that to 
have been part of the complaint that was made to Santander so Im unable to 
consider that payment as part of this complaint; 
I consider that Santander acted correctly by making a chargeback claim but it was 
defended by the dealer and, although I consider that it should have provided a 
clearer explanation at that time about the chargeback process and its reasons for not 
proceeding any further with the chargeback claim, I consider that there was no 
reasonable prospect of the claim being successful and that it was fair and reasonable 
for it to decide to proceed no further with the claim;
Santander credited the £3,299 to Mrs Hs account and made a chargeback claim to 
the dealer but it re-debited the £3,299 from Mrs Hs account when it had decided to 
proceed no further with the chargeback claim  I consider those to have been 
reasonable actions for Santander to have taken;
Santander accepts that it hadnt responded to all of the questions that Mrs C had 
raised and that there was a lack of clarity in its process and it says that it has credited 
a total of £150 to Mrs Hs account  I consider that to have been a fair and 
reasonable response to those issues and Im not persuaded that an award of more 
compensation is justified in these circumstances;
nor am I persuaded that Santander has incorrect information in its records about the 
chargeback claim or that it should be required to rectify its records;
Mrs C has referred to Mrs Hs age and disability but Santander says that it wasnt 
made aware of any vulnerability and Im not persuaded that it should have responded 
to her claim any differently in these circumstances because of her age and disability; 
and
I sympathise with Mrs H and Mrs C for the issues that theyve had with the car and 
the difficulties that theyve described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or for me to 
require Santander to refund to Mrs H the payments that she made for the car, to pay 
her any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mrs Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs H to accept or 
reject my decision before 28 November 2022.
