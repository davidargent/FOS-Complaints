K820x#14complaint
Mr M complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) didnt help with his level of 
debt and financial situation.
background
Mr M was concerned about  his finances.  So he contacted NatWest to ask for help. He spent  
over two hours going through his income, expenses and debts to various  departments at 
NatWest. Mr M was told NatWest couldnt  really  help him. His only option  was to talk with 
NatWests collections team if his account  went into default. So hed like the bank to work  out 
a solution with him.
NatWest was sorry to hear Mr M was unhappy  with the service itd provided. The interest 
and charges had been  applied to his account  in accordance with the terms and conditions. 
And it could  only suspend the charges  if Mr Ms account went into default and was passed to 
its recoveries team. However NatWest had refunded some interest and charges as a gesture 
of goodwill.  
Mr M wasnt satisfied  with NatWests response. So he contacted our service and our 
adjudicator looked into the matter. He appreciated the difficult  situation Mr M found himself 
in. But he felt NatWest  had dealt with the complaint fairly. Itd refunded  interest, fees and 
charges even though it didnt have to. All of the charges had been applied  correctly in line 
with the terms and conditions of the accounts.
He could see Mr M had been  able to make the monthly payments to his accounts. And 
NatWest had provided quotes  for a refinance  loan. But the rate was higher than the rates 
Mr M was currently paying. And he couldnt interfere with the banks business decisions.
Mr M didnt  agree. So hes asked for an ombudsmans final decision. Hed had to contact a 
debt charity to discuss a debt management plan. He had more  expenses that he could 
afford. And hes relying  on family to help him out. Mr M is concerned any arrangement will 
affect his credit rating.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Im sorry  to hear of the difficulties Mr M finds himself  in. Mr M has explained there are a 
number of family-related  issues surrounding  his finances. And I sympathise with the difficult 
situation Mr M is in. But Im afraid I agree with our adjudicator that NatWest  hasnt  done  
anything wrong.
Ive considered all of the points Mr M made  in response to our adjudicators  view.  And Ive 
looked at what  NatWest did to help and whether  the bank has done  anything wrong.
Mr M spoke  to NatWests financial difficulties team in January 2019. He had accumulated  a 
large amount of debt. And he was sending his brother £400  every month while  he found 
employment. Mr M said he was paying  over £800 each month in debt repayment. And he 
was concerned any default would affect  his British naturalisation application. So he wanted 
NatWest to make some  temporary arrangements while things improved. 
Ref: DRN30149722Mr M made a number of suggestions to NatWest while he was discussing his finances. He 
asked if the bank would freeze the interest  on his overdraft for 12 months. Or convert his 
overdraft to a personal loan to reduce the interest  rate as his other bank  had done.
I can see NatWest has refunded nearly £300  of interest and charges so the account didnt 
go into default. And the bank also looked  at a number of loans to see if Mr M could  
consolidate his debt and reduce his payments. Unfortunately the rate offered was higher 
than the rates Mr M was already paying.  And thats not something  I can interfere with. The 
bank is entitled  to make commercial decisions on who it lends money to and at what  rate.
I realise the refunds wont solve Mr Ms financial difficulties. But I do think  they were  a 
positive response  to try and help Mr M avoid further charges and defaults on his credit  file. 
And because Mr M hadnt missed  any of his previous  payments  or defaulted on his accounts  
NatWest was limited on what it could do to help.
Once an account goes into default I would expect NatWest to suspend all future interest and 
charges. And it would then be in a position to discuss an affordable debt repayment plan 
with Mr M. But the default would also be reported  to the credit reference agencies  and affect  
Mr Ms credit rating for a number of years.
I do appreciate how frustrating this is for Mr M. Hes been under considerable pressure due 
to family circumstances. But hes tried to manage  his finances and continue his monthly  
payments. And thats to his credit.  And I understand he just wants  NatWest to help while his 
circumstances improve. 
But its not the role of this service to look at NatWests commercial decisions  or to compare 
them to other banks. Our role is to assess what impact any mistakes  may have had on its 
customers.
Ive not seen anything to suggest the interest  or charges have been applied incorrectly.  And I 
think NatWest did respond  sympathetically. Mr M had been able to make his contracted  
monthly payments.  And hed managed his accounts  despite a high level of debt. So there 
were limits to what NatWest could do to help unless Mr M began  to fall behind on his 
payments. I wouldnt expect a bank  to agree to a repayment plan unless  an account had 
gone into default.
Mr M just wanted NatWest to help him through some short-term difficulty. But thats not 
something this service can ask NatWest  to do. We cant tell a bank  to change its commercial  
decisions or practises. We can only look to see if its done  anything wrong. 
I realise Mr M will be disappointed by this outcome. But based on everything Ive seen I cant 
say NatWest has made any mistakes. And I wont be asking the bank to do anything  more.
my final decision
My final decision is that I do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 August 2019.
