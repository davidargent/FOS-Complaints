K820x#14complaint
Ms S is complaining about The Prudential Assurance Company Limited because its 
provided contradictory and confusing information about the amount she owes  on her policy.
background
In 1992, Ms S took out an income  protection insurance policy with Scottish Amicable  (now  
Prudential). It was designed  to pay a regular income if she becomes unable to work due to 
ill-health. Following a decision  by one of my colleagues in 2016, Prudential  was required to 
reinstate the policy and extend the term to her 65th birthday.
On 26 October 2016, Prudential wrote to confirm it had reinstated the policy and set out a 
payment plan so Ms S could make up the payments missed while her complaint was being 
resolved, over a period  of 18 months.  It also said it would contact her again in May 2018  to 
confirm what the monthly payments would be when  the payment  plan was finished.
When Prudential was in contact with Ms S again in 2018, it provided misleading information  
about the amount owing and this caused  confusion. Ms S tried to make extra payments, but 
the situation wasnt resolved and her cover  lapsed  as a result. In recognition of the confusing 
correspondence provided, Prudential offered compensation of £300  and told Ms S how 
much it thought she owed  to bring  the policy up to date so it could be reinstated.
I previously issued my provisional decision explaining why I didnt think this complaint should 
be upheld. I set out what I thought needed to be done if Ms S decides she wants to continue 
with the policy and why I thought the compensation Prudential  has already offered is fair.
Ms S didnt accept my provisional decision and made  the following key points:
She paid two premiums in May 2018, covering the amounts owed in April and May of 
that year.
It took Prudential  several months  to sort things out after my colleagues decision in 
2016 and she spent considerable time chasing this.
When she contacted  Prudential in April 2018 to clarify the situation with her policy,  
she again received poor service, involving wrong  information  and considerable time 
trying to resolve things.
During this time, she didnt know if she was covered or not. The amount of 
compensation offered doesnt  take adequate account of the stress shes  suffered and 
the time shes spent  on this.
Shes worried other customers have been  affected by poor service in the same  way.
Shes now decided  she wont pay any more into the policy and regrets continuing 
with it in 2016.
Ref: DRN67549272my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Having reconsidered the case, including 
Ms Ss response to my provisional  decision, my conclusions havent changed.
In terms of the payments made, I have considered the bank statements Ms S has provided. 
While there  is a small discrepancy over exactly  when each payment was made, her records  
of the actual amounts paid since April 2018 exactly match Prudentials of the amounts  its 
received during the same period. As Ms S hasnt provided any evidence  to show shes paid 
any more than Prudential  says it received before that either, I can only conclude  the amount 
Prudential says she owes is correct.  This is how much Ms S would need to pay to restart her 
policy.
Theres no dispute that Prudential has made errors.  I can see it took some time to restart  
cover in 2016, but I note it recognised that when it reduced the arrears to be repaid by £200.  
This wasnt something it was required to do to comply with my colleagues decision.
Since then,  theres  no dispute Prudential has made further errors  and that this has led to 
considerable confusion.  The issue I have to decide is what  it should do to put things  right.
Its important to understand the ombudsman service  isnt the industry regulator. That means 
we dont set the rules  for financial businesses or police the industry to make  sure the rules 
are followed.  It also means I dont  have the power to fine or punish a business for poor 
practice. Instead, my role is to consider individual complaints and make decisions I consider 
to be fair and reasonable in the circumstances. Where I award compensation, the main aim 
is to put the consumer back into the position he/she would be in but for the business  error.
In this case, Ms S is in a position where shes actually  paid less in premiums  since the policy  
started than she would have if the problems shes experienced hadnt happened. So I dont 
think I can reasonably say shes suffered a loss for which she should be compensated. I 
understand Ms S has spent time trying to resolve the situation with her policy, but we dont 
normally compensate  for the time associated with pursuing a complaint and Ive already 
explained Im not looking  to do that here.
The above  notwithstanding, I can see Ms S has suffered unnecessary trouble, upset  and 
stress. The impact this has had on her is not straightforward to assess, but in the 
circumstances I still think a moderate payment of £300 is reasonable. This is in addition  to 
the £200 Prudential wrote off the outstanding premiums in 2016.
Its now for Ms S to decide  whether she wants to restart her policy so she can continue  with 
the cover  it provides.  I understand why she may not feel thats worthwhile. But if, after further 
reflection, she changes her mind  then Ive explained  what she needs to do and that she 
wont have any cover unless she does it. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint.
Prudential has already made an offer to pay £300 to settle the complaint and I think this is 
fair in the circumstances. So if she hasnt already received that and now wishes  to accept it, 
Ref: DRN67549273my decision  is that The Prudential Assurance Company Limited should pay Ms S 
compensation of £300.
If Ms S changes her mind and decides she wants to reinstate her policy and continue  with 
the cover, she should confirm this when  responding to my decision. To be clear, if she 
accepts my decision, Ms S will be entitled  to the £300 compensation whether or not she 
decides to restart the policy.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision  before 8 March 2019.

my provisional  findings
Prior to Ms Ss original complaint, its my understanding  premiums hadnt been paid since December 
2015. On 26 October 2016, Prudential wrote  to Ms S setting out the amount shed need to pay over 
the next 18 months to bring the policy up to date, covering  both the normal  premium due and the 
missed payments. Prudential has now provided  the following list of all the payments it thinks should 
have been paid since December 2015 and the payments it thinks it has received.

Ms S has provided evidence of the payments shes made since April 2018 and these  correspond with 
Prudentials records for the same period. If Ms S thinks the above figures  for the period before April 
2018 are wrong,  Im happy to look at any further evidence  she provides.
Assuming the above figures are correct,  and taking account of the £200 Prudential wrote off in 
October 2016, this means Ms S would need to pay £1,008.32 to bring the policy up to date today. 
That amount will increase  each  time a monthly payment is missed.
I understand the policy  has lapsed due to missed premiums and that means she isnt covered at the 
moment. If Ms S wants the policy to be reinstated again so she can continue to benefit from cover, 
shed need to pay the monthly  premium of £155.24 going forward. I understand she completed a 
direct debit instruction  in July 2018, but its not clear if this is still valid. If not, shell need to complete 
another.
To bring the policy up to date so it can be reinstated, Ms S would  also need to make  up the premium  
payments that have  been missed. As I said above, I currently think  these total £1,008.32, but that 
amount will increase each time a further payment is missed. It should  help to avoid a repeat  of the 
problems shes recently experienced if Ms S is able to pay this amount  in one go. But if not, 
Prudential is willing to set up another payment arrangement so it can be paid in instalments.
Its up to Ms S whether she wants to reinstate and continue  with her policy, but Ive set out above 
what needs to happen if she opts to do so. She can notify Prudential of her decision when  shes had a 
chance to think about it or speak to our adjudicator.
This issue aside, its clear Prudential has made errors  in its recent communication with Ms S and this 
has caused  considerable confusion. Im pleased  Prudential accepted this and has apologised for the 
poor service provided. Ive thought carefully about what  else it should  do to put things right.
I dont think its appropriate to require Prudential  to waive the missed  premiums needed to bring 
Ms Ss policy up to date so it can be reinstated. But I do think some  compensation is due for the 
unnecessary trouble and upset shes experienced.
The impact  of this issue on Ms S, and therefore the amount to award, is difficult to assess. Its also 
important to understand we dont normally  award compensation for the time involved in pursuing a 
complaint. On balance, I think the £300 Prudential  has already offered is reasonable in the 
circumstances. As a result, and because Prudential  has said its willing to reinstate the policy if 
payments are brought up to date, Im not currently planning  to require it do anything  else.
Ms S should  now think  carefully about whether she wants to continue with her policy  or not and either  
let Prudential or our adjudicator know. She should also confirm whether  shes able to pay the missed  
premiums in one go or if she needs to do so in instalments. If she accepts  my decision, Ms S will still 
be entitled to the £300 compensation whether  or not she continues  with her policy. If she does 
continue with the policy, it might be prudent for Prudential to use it to reduce  the payment  arrears 
instead of sending her the money.  But that would also be a decision for Ms S to make.
Ref: DRN67549276I appreciate Ms S probably wont be entirely satisfied with everything Ive said. But I do agree with her 
that Prudentials service has fallen  short of the standard she was entitled to expect. If the complaint is 
resolved in the way Ive suggested, I think that would be a fair outcome.
my provisional  decision
My provisional  decision  is that I dont intend to uphold  this complaint.
Prudential has already made  an offer to pay £300 to settle the complaint and I think this is fair in the 
circumstances. So if she hasnt already received that and now wishes to accept  it, my provisional 
decision is that The Prudential Assurance Company Limited should pay Ms S compensation  of £300.
If Ms S wants to reinstate  her policy  so she can continue to have the cover it provides, Ive set out 
above what shed need to do. Its in her interest to make a decision on that as soon as she reasonably  
can because the amount  of missing premiums to be repaid will continue  to increase each  month and 
she wont be covered until appropriate arrangements are made  so the policy can be reinstated.
