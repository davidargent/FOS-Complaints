Complaint
Mr L is unhappy that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) closed his accounts and 
failed to return the funds in them.
Background
In September 2020, NatWest notified Mr L that it wasnt prepared to go ahead with his 
application for a current account and savings account. By this stage Mr L had already 
transferred funds from an account elsewhere and these funds were returned to the financial 
institution that sent them, rather than to Mr L. Mr L was unhappy with this and complained. 
NatWest didnt uphold Mr Ls complaint. As Mr L remained dissatisfied, Mr L referred the 
matter to our service.
One of our adjudicators looked into Mr Ls concerns. She didnt think that NatWest had done 
anything wrong or treated Mr L unfairly and so didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. 
Mr L disagreed and so the complaint was passed to an ombudsman for a final decision.  
My findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having carefully considered everything, I dont think that NatWest acted unfairly towards    
Mr L and so Im not upholding his complaint. Ill explain why in a little more detail.
As our adjudicator explained to Mr L, a bank is under no obligation to continue offering 
accounts to a consumer if it doesnt wish to do so. And NatWest decided it didnt wish to 
have Mr L as a customer. Closing a customers accounts, or declining to finalise and 
application, is a commercial decision that a bank is entitled to take. And it has no obligation 
to share its reasons for that decision. Equally, having looked at matters Im also satisfied that 
NatWest was entitled to take the action it did in line with the terms and conditions of Mr Ls 
accounts.
I know Mr L remains unhappy that NatWest hasnt returned the funds that were in his 
accounts at the time they were closed. But it looks like NatWest has returned all of the funds 
to the institution that sent them in the first place  in order words they were returned to 
source. Mr L may be unhappy with this. But he is free to go contact the financial institution 
which the funds were returned to if he still feels that he is entitled to them. In any event, and 
most importantly, I dont think that NatWest did anything wrong or unfair when it returned the 
funds in question to the financial institution that sent them.   
So overall and having considered everything, I dont think NatWest acted unfairly towards   
Mr L and Im not upholding this complaint. I appreciate this will be very disappointing for     
Mr L. But I hope hell understand the reasons for my decision and that hell appreciate why I 
think NatWest hasnt acted unfairly or unreasonably towards him.
My final decision
For the reasons Ive explained, Im not upholding Mr Ls complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr L to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2023.
