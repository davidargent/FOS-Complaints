The complaint
Mr G complains about the way a chargeback dispute was handled by PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA (PayPal).
What happened
The background to this complaint and my initial conclusions were set out in my provisional 
decision. I said: 
In November 2022 Mr G sold two event tickets to a third party and the funds were paid to his 
PayPal account. Mr G has provided evidence from the online ticket retailer he used to sell 
the tickets that they were transferred to a buyer on 11 November 2022.
The buyer went on to raise a chargeback dispute via their bank and card provider. PayPal 
says it asked Mr G for evidence that the tickets he sold had been delivered and received by 
the buyer. PayPal says Mr G provided online chat logs but didnt provide evidence the items 
had been received by the buyer. Mr G, in turn, says he sent PayPal the systems evidence he 
had from the online ticket retailer to show they had been transferred to the buyer on 
completion of the sale.
In December 2022 Mr G was advised his chargeback claim had failed. But PayPal agreed to 
refund the disputed transaction and dispute fee it applied as a gesture of goodwill.
Mr G complained and explained he was concerned that PayPals decision not to attempt to 
retrieve his funds via the Seller Protection Programme was unfair and would negatively 
impact how his account was viewed in the future. PayPal didnt agree that it had acted 
unfairly and didnt uphold Mr Gs complaint.
An investigator at this service looked at Mr Gs complaint and upheld it. They thought Mr G 
had provided compelling evidence to show the tickets hed sold had been delivered to the 
buyer. The investigator thought Mr G had needed to make an unreasonable level of calls to 
PayPal and that the process of dealing with the dispute had caused unnecessary trouble and 
upset. In addition, the investigator said PayPal needed to refund the dispute fee it had 
applied. The investigator asked PayPal to pay Mr G £150 for the distress and inconvenience 
caused. PayPal didnt agree and asked to appeal so Mr Gs complaint has been passed to
me to make a decision.
What Ive provisionally decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
PayPal has explained that the buyers bank and card issuer upheld his chargeback dispute. 
PayPal hasnt provided any evidence to show whether enquiries were made with it before 
the chargeback claim was upheld. But Im satisfied PayPal correctly explains that the 
decision about the outcome of the chargeback claim ultimately laid with the buyers bank and 
card provider.
With that said, PayPal has its Sellers Protection Programme in place to support customers. 
PayPals highlighted sections of the agreement and explained Mr Gs case wouldnt have 
met the terms as he didnt provide evidence to support the tickets had been delivered. But 
the section PayPal highlighted relates to physical goods. Here, Mr G was selling tickets hed 
purchased online  there were no physical tickets.
PayPals user agreement contains a section relating to disputes about intangible goods. This 
section of the agreement says for intangible or digital goods proof of delivery means 
compelling evidence to show the item was delivered or purchase order was fulfilled. Ive 
looked at whether Mr G has provided compelling evidence.
Mr G has forwarded screen prints from the online ticket retailer. They show the transfer was 
initially sent to the buyer at 8:38pm on 8 November 2022. They further show the transfer was 
marked as complete by the online ticket retailer at 8:58pm on 8 November 2022. Mr Gs 
confirmed this information was forwarded to PayPal and I see no reason why it wouldnt 
meet the standard for compelling evidence under the user agreement. In my view, Mr G did 
provide the necessary information that wouldve allowed PayPal to raise a dispute on his 
behalf.
I can see there has been a lot of back and forth between Mr G and PayPal. Mr Gs given us 
details of all the contact, including time taken to make calls, when trying to resolve the 
dispute. I can understand why Mr G grew frustrated at being told the chargeback claim 
hadnt gone in his favour and that PayPal refused to raise a seller dispute on his behalf. Im 
pleased PayPal took the decision to refund the disputed funds to Mr G. But I accept he felt 
dissatisfied and upset by the way the dispute was handled.
Ive taken the step of issuing a provisional decision as the investigator issued two sets of 
findings asking PayPal to refund the dispute fee it applied. But PayPals supplied systems 
evidence to show the fee was refunded on 7 December 2022 along with the £50 payment. 
So Im not telling PayPal to refund anything else to Mr G.
PayPal has confirmed the dispute has caused no negative impact in terms of how it views Mr 
Gs account. And Ive seen nothing that shows PayPal will treat Mr G differently as a result of 
the dispute. But, for the reasons Ive given above, Im satisfied PayPal failed to treat Mr G 
fairly and caused a reasonable level of distress and inconvenience. So Im going to proceed 
in line with the investigators view and award Mr G £150 for the distress and inconvenience 
caused.
I invited both parties to respond with any additional comments or information they wanted 
me to consider before I made my final decision. Mr G responded and confirmed he was he 
had nothing further to add. We didnt hear back from PayPal. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither party has provided new information for me to consider, I see no reason to change 
the conclusions I reached in my provisional decision. I still think Mr Gs complaint should be 
upheld, for the same reasons. My final decision
My decision is that I uphold Mr Gs complaint and direct PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA to 
settle by paying him £150.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 9 January 2024.
