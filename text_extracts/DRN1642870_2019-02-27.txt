K821x#15complaint
Mr F complains that Stagemount Limited  (trading as Quid  Market) gave him loans  that he 
couldnt afford to repay.
background
The background to this complaint was set out in the provisional decision I issued in 
January 2019.  An extract from this is attached and forms part of this final decision, so I will 
not repeat  that information here.
In my provisional decision I set out why I was minded  to uphold the complaint. I invited both 
parties to let me have any further comments and evidence.  Mr F has said he has nothing 
further to add. Quid Market hasnt responded to my provisional decision. 
my findings
Ive once more  considered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Given that neither Mr F nor 
Quid Market have provided me with anything further  in relation to this complaint I see no 
reason to change  the findings I reached in my provisional  decision.
So I think that if Quid Market had done what I consider  to be proportionate checks before 
lending to Mr F it would  have concluded that he couldnt sustainably  afford  loans 1 to 9. So, 
as a responsible  lender, it shouldnt have  agreed to give him these loans. And Quid  Market 
has already said that it shouldnt  have  given Mr F loans 10 to 12 either.  So Quid  Market 
needs to pay Mr F some  compensation.
putting things right
I dont think Quid Market  should have agreed  to give Mr F loans 1 to 12  that is the loans he 
took in 2011, 2012  and 2013. So for each of those  loans  Quid Market should;
Refund any interest and charges applied to the loans. 
Add simple interest at a rate of 8% per annum to each of these amounts from the date 
they were paid to the date of settlement*.
Remove any adverse  information recorded on Mr Fs credit file in relation to the loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Quid Market  to take off tax from this interest. Quid  Market 
must give Mr F a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
Ref: DRN16428702my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold most of Mr Fs complaint and direct  Stagemount Limited  to 
put things right as detailed above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr F to accept or 
reject my decision  before 27 March  2019.

complaint
Mr F complains that Stagemount Limited  (trading  as Quid Market) gave him loans that he couldnt 
afford to repay.
background
Mr F was given 14 loans by Quid Market between February 2011  and September  2014. He was 
unable to repay two of the loans as originally agreed and so rolled them over to the following month 
by paying some additional interest. But all of Mr Fs loans from Quid Market  have now been fully 
repaid. A summary  of his borrowing from Quid Market is as follows;

When Mr F first complained to Quid Market  it agreed that it shouldnt have given him loans 10 to 12. 
So it offered to pay him some compensation. But it didnt agree that it had been  wrong to provide the 
remaining loans. Mr F didnt  accept Quid Markets offer so he brought  his complaint to this Service.
Mr Fs complaint has been  assessed by one of our adjudicators. He thought that Quid  Market should  
have done more  checks before agreeing each of the loans  that it gave to Mr F. And he thought  that 
better checks would have  shown  Quid Market  that the loans werent  sustainably affordable for Mr F. 
So he asked Quid Market to pay some further compensation  to Mr F, in addition to what it had already 
offered.
Quid Market  didnt agree  with that assessment. So, as the complaint hasnt been resolved informally, 
it has been  passed to me, an ombudsman, to decide. 
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Ive also taken into account the law, any relevant regulatory rules and 
good industry practice at the time the loans were offered.
Ref: DRN16428704Quid Market  was required to lend responsibly. It needed to make  checks to see whether Mr F could 
afford to pay back each  loan before it lent to him. Those checks  needed to be proportionate to things 
such as the amount Mr F was borrowing,  and his lending  history, but there was no set list of checks 
Quid Market  had to do.
Quid Market  has told us about the checks it did before lending to Mr F. Before  each loan it asked him 
for details of his normal income. And it checked his credit file before agreeing each loan too. Ive seen 
a summary of the results that Quid Market received from those checks and I dont think they should  
have caused any additional concerns to the lender.
Mr F has explained that he was subject to an IVA, and other debt management  arrangements, 
throughout most of the time he was borrowing from Quid Market. But this wasnt something  he told 
Quid Market  about at the time, although it is something that Quid Market  might have discovered if it 
had done some of the more  extensive  checks I am suggesting were  needed  for some of the loans. 
But even so, I dont think a consumer being in a debt management plan is necessarily a reason for a 
lender to decline  a loan request, although it may cause  the lender to undertake more  checks. The 
debt management plan simply shows that a consumer has faced, and perhaps responsibly  dealt with, 
debt problems  in the past. It might be that their financial situation had since stabilised, and taking 
further loans wouldnt cause them further financial difficulties.
The first loan was relatively modest compared  to the income that Mr F declared. But I dont think it 
was so small that it was reasonable for Quid Market to base  its affordability assessment on Mr Fs 
income alone.  I think it should also have asked him about his normal living  costs before agreeing  the 
loan. 
And I think the same applies to the second loan Mr F took. He asked to borrow  again just a couple of 
weeks after repaying  his first loan. And the amount he asked to borrow remained  the same. So I think  
a proportionate  check  here would have looked at his expenditure as well as his income.
Mr F wasnt able to repay his second loan when  he had originally agreed. He deferred his repayment 
for a month by paying some  additional interest. And just a couple  of weeks after ultimately  repaying 
that loan he asked to borrow again. The amount  he asked to borrow had increased by 25%. So I think 
Quid Market  should have been increasingly  concerned that Mr Fs finances were under pressure and 
that he might be relying on its lending  to support his normal living costs.  In addition to asking him 
about these costs  I think  Quid Market should by now have also asked Mr F some very specific 
questions about any other short term loans  that he was already committed to repaying.
Less than two weeks after repaying his third loan Mr F asked to borrow  again. This was now his fourth 
loan request  in just over three months. And the amount he asked to borrow increased once again. So 
as before I think Quid Market should have asked Mr F about both his normal living costs and about  
any other short term loans that he was already  committed to repaying.
When Mr F asked  for his fifth loan, shortly after repaying  his fourth,  I think Quid Market should have 
reached the point where it decided it could no longer  safely rely on information being provided by Mr F 
about his finances.  I think from this point onwards it should have taken steps to independently  verify 
Mr Fs true financial position.  And I think that would apply  to each of the loans that Mr F took until 
there was a significant break in his borrowing  between loan 12 and loan 13.
I can see that Quid Market  has already told Mr F that it shouldnt have given  him loans 10 to 12. So 
Im not going  to comment any further on these loans  except to direct Quid Market  to pay the 
compensation it has offered to Mr F for them.
Ref: DRN16428705There was a gap of over a year between Mr F repaying  loan 12 and asking to borrow again. I think it 
would be reasonable, given the length of that gap, for Quid Market to conclude that any problems 
Mr F had previously faced with his finances had now been resolved. So I think it is reasonable the 
Quid Market  should treat Mr Fs application for loan 13 as if it had come from a new borrower.
The last two loans that Mr F took were for similar amounts to his first two loans. And since he told 
Quid Market  that his income was unchanged  I think similar checks  would  have been appropriate here. 
So I think Quid Market should also have asked Mr F about his normal living  costs before agreeing the 
last two loans.
Although I dont think the checks Quid Market did before agreeing any of the loans were sufficient, 
that in itself doesnt  mean that Mr Fs complaint should succeed. Id also need to be persuaded  that 
what I consider  to be proportionate checks would  have  shown Quid  Market that Mr F couldnt 
sustainably afford the loans. So Ive looked at Mr Fs bank statements,  and what hes told us about  his 
financial situation, to see what better checks would have shown Quid Market.
When he took the first two loans, Mr Fs bank statements show that he had just under £200 left over 
each month  after paying his share of the household bills and his other regular  credit commitments.  So 
that wouldnt have left him with enough to meet  the repayments  that he needed to make on the loans 
he was taking  from Quid  Market.
Mr Fs regular expenses remained relatively  similar  over the rest of 2012 and 2013.  But further  checks 
from Quid Market would  have identified  that Mr F was also borrowing  regularly and in increasing 
amounts from a number of other short term lenders.  These were  loans that he needed  to repay  at the 
same time as his borrowing from Quid Market. So by this time I think proportionate checks  would  
have identified that Mr F didnt  have  any disposable income that he could use to repay his borrowing 
from Quid Market.
In 2014 when  Mr F took his last two loans  his normal expenditure  seems to have been a little lower. 
I have considered that Mr F was repaying  some earlier borrowing, from other lenders, through a debt 
management arrangement at that time. And that did mean the credit check  results Quid Market  
received showed some  outstanding borrowing.  But the key here is whether  Mr F could afford  to repay 
these loans. And based on what I think proportionate checks  would have shown to Quid  Market I think  
it is reasonable  to conclude the final two loans were affordable for him.
I think  if Quid Market had done what I consider to be proportionate  checks before lending to Mr F it 
would have concluded that he couldnt sustainably  afford loans 1 to 9. So, as a responsible lender, it 
shouldnt have agreed to give him these  loans. And Quid Market has already said that it shouldnt 
have given Mr F loans 10 to 12 either. So Quid Market needs to pay Mr F some compensation.
