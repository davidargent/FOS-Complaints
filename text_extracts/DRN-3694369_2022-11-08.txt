The complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc wrote to him about an old debt on his 
credit file, and he complains about how NatWest then dealt with his complaint. 
What happened
Mr A told us that he had a joint mortgage with a former partner. They then separated, and Mr 
A reached a partial settlement for his liability in 2012. Mr A said that he found out in 2018 
that the outstanding balance was still showing on his credit file. He told NatWest about this, 
and he said the issue was amicably resolved. 
Mr A said more recently, hed been sent a letter by NatWest to an address he no longer lives 
at. The letter was passed on to him, it told him he had an outstanding debt in relation to the 
mortgage, even though NatWest previously confirmed that he didnt owe any money. 
Mr A said he raised a complaint with NatWest and specifically asked for a call before the 
complaint was resolved. He said that wasnt respected, he just got a letter saying that 
NatWest would pay him £100. Mr A was extremely unhappy with how NatWest had handled 
his complaint, including the tone of the call handler, and NatWests repeated refusal to call 
him to discuss things before it wrote.
Mr A told us that this had brought back memories of a very difficult time and he told us about 
the impact this had on his mental health. 
Mr A wanted NatWest to confirm that he wouldnt be pursued for this debt. He wanted 
NatWest to apologise for the distress the letter had caused him. He wanted to know why the 
letter was sent to an address he no longer lives at. He wanted to know why he wasnt called 
when he had specifically requested this. He wanted NatWest to understand the emotional 
impact this had had on him. 
Mr A said that he had asked NatWest for £200 in compensation for the complaint, and a 
further £50 to reflect its terrible handling of his complaint. 
NatWest said it was sorry that a letter had been sent to Mr A in error. It accepted that any 
suggestion he still had a debt was a mistake, and it said this letter had been issued as a 
clerical error. NatWest said it had taken steps to make sure this didnt happen again, and it 
offered to pay Mr A £100. 
When NatWest wrote to us, it also said that it had arranged for Mr As credit file to be 
updated. It said it had written to the address it held on file for Mr A. Mr A had since said he 
didnt wish to supply NatWest with updated contact information. NatWest thought it had done 
enough to resolve this complaint, and it wouldnt increase Mr As compensation. 
Our investigator thought this complaint should be upheld. She said NatWest had accepted 
that it got things wrong here. The letter received by Mr A in 2021 was sent in error and 
contained inaccurate information. This caused Mr A a great deal of distress.
Our investigator said she had considered both the seriousness of the mistake and the impact 
upon Mr A. She said that £100 would have been appropriate if this was the first time 
NatWest had made this mistake, but it wasnt. Mr A had had to deal with the whole issue 
over again, and hed told us about how this impacted on him. So she thought NatWest 
should pay Mr A £200 to say sorry.
NatWest agreed, but Mr A didnt. He felt that our investigator hadnt taken fully into account 
how this issue had affected him, and particularly what had happened when hed told 
NatWest that he wasnt happy with its written response. Because no agreement was 
reached, this case was passed to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive reached the same overall conclusion on this complaint as our investigator.
Id like to deal first with some of the queries Mr A raised. I think NatWest sent this letter to 
him at the wrong address because thats the address it still held for him. I understand that Mr 
A wouldnt feel the need to update his address with NatWest, if he no longer has dealings 
with the bank, but I dont think its wrong for NatWest to write to the last address it holds for 
him. However, I think NatWest has been clear that this letter was sent by mistake, it no 
longer considers Mr A owes it money. It has apologised, and it has taken steps to seek to 
ensure this doesnt happen again.
I think there are then two issues. The first is the compensation payment for issuing the letter, 
which Mr A asked NatWest to increase to £200, to take account of the impact that this had 
on him. NatWest has now agreed to do this. The letter in itself was issued as a simple 
oversight, which NatWest recognised quickly. And Mr A himself in his complaint to us 
accepted that the impact on other people might be small. So in other circumstances an 
apology may have been sufficient. But here, Mr A has described the impact this had on him 
personally and on his relationship, so I understand why he feels very strongly about this. Im 
glad to see that NatWest has agreed to increase the compensation payment in this case, 
and I think that £200 provides a fair and reasonable outcome to this part of Mr As complaint.
The second issue is how NatWest handled Mr As complaint. Mr A has also detailed what he 
considers to be failings in NatWests complaint handling procedures, because he didnt 
receive any call before his complaint response letter was issued by NatWest, and when he 
sought to speak to a manager after this, he was repeatedly refused. He also said that the 
tone of NatWests complaint handler was unacceptable, and he showed no empathy.
Mr A has been clear that he considers NatWest should pay an additional £50 for how it 
handled his complaint. However, our service isnt able to make that award to him. Complaint 
handling isnt a regulated activity, and that means our service has no powers to consider a 
complaint point which is, as Mr A has set out here, solely about how NatWest dealt with a 
complaint. So Im sorry to have to tell Mr A that I wont be able to comment on this aspect of 
his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc must pay Mr A a total of £200 in 
compensation. National Westminster Bank Plc can count towards that amount any payment 
it has already made to Mr A for this complaint.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 December 2022.
