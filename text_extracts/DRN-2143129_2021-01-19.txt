The complaint
Mr H complains that Volkswagen Financial Services (UK) Limited, trading as Audi Finance, 
wont pay for repairs that were required on a car that  was supplied to him under a hire 
agreement.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties and have been set out by the 
investigator so I wont repeat them again here. Instead Ill focus on giving the reasons for my 
decision. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
a new car was supplied to Mr H under a hire agreement with Audi Finance that he 
signed in February 2017  and which included some maintenance of the car;
Audi Finance, as the supplier of the car, was responsible for ensuring that it was of 
satisfactory quality at that time - whether or not it was of satisfactory quality will 
depend on a number of factors, including the age and mileage of the car and the 
price that was paid for it;
satisfactory quality also covers durability which means that the components within 
the car must be durable and last a reasonable amount of time  but exactly how long 
that time is will also depend on a number of factors;
the car that was supplied to Mr H was a new car and I consider that it was 
reasonable for him to expect that it would be free from even minor defects;
Mr H complained to Audi Finance in August 2019 that the cars clutch needed 
replacing  it contacted the dealer which said that the damage resulted from 
overheating which was caused by driving style, not by a manufacturing defect or 
wear and tear, so wasnt covered by the maintenance package;
Mr H paid Â£1,369.03 for the cars clutch to be replaced in August 2019 and the 
invoice for the work says:  removed gearbox found clutch plate burnt out causing 
damage to flywheel, Replaced clutch, flywheel and release bearing ; but Audi 
Finance said that it was unable to contribute to those costs;
Mr H complained to this service but our investigator didnt think that it would be fair to 
uphold his complaint or to ask Audi Finance to do anything differently;
the car was supplied to Mr H in February 2017 but Ive seen no evidence to show 
that he complained to the dealer (or to Audi Finance) about any issues with the cars 
clutch until August 2019  that was about two and a half years later and in that time 
the car had been driven for 27,268 miles; 
if there had been a manufacturing defect with the cars clutch, or the car hadnt been 
of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to Mr H, I consider it to be more likely 
than not that it would have become evident much sooner than it did  and Im not 
persuaded that its likely that Mr H would have been able to use the car for two and a 
half years and to drive 27,268 miles;
Ive considered Mr H;s comments about his, and his wifes, driving experience and 
the likelihood of their driving style having burnt out the clutch, and also his proposal 
that the cost of the repairs should be split equally between him and Audi Finance;
I sympathise with Mr H for the issue that hes had with the cars clutch and for the 
cost of the repairs that hes had to pay for, but Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that the car wasnt of satisfactory quality when it was supplied to 
him; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Audi Finance to reimburse Mr H for all, or any part, of the repair costs, to pay him any 
compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Hs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 16 February 2021.
