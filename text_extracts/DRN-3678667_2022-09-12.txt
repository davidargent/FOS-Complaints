The complaint
Ms A complains that AvantCredit of UK, LLC lent her a loan she couldnt afford.
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision. 
AvantCredit hasnt responded to the adjudicators opinion so I dont know what, if anything, it 
disagrees with.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I wont be upholding this complaint and I have set out my reasons below;
AvantCredits checks went far enough based on the circumstances of the lending but 
I dont think it reacted appropriately to the information its checks revealed.
AvantCredits checks showed Ms A to have a monthly income of £1,400. The checks 
showed her monthly living expenses as £680. The search of her credit file showed 
she was due to repay £746 towards unsecured credit the following month.
Looking at those figures Ms A was left with no disposable income to make the 
monthly repayment of around £66.50 towards this loan.
AvantCredit should have seen Ms A couldnt afford to repay the loan over the term 
and this was borne out when she struggled to keep up repayments within a short 
time of taking out the loan.
Ms A has lost out as a result of having a loan she shouldnt have been given and 
AvantCredit needs to put things right.
Putting things right
Its unclear if theres still an outstanding balance on the loan as Ms A went into an Individual 
Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) to repay the loan. So, to put things right, AvantCredit should;
Remove all interest, fees and charges applied to the loan.
Treat any payments made by Ms A as payments towards the capital amount of 
£1,000.
If Ms A has paid more than the capital, then any overpayments should be refunded to 
with 8%* simple interest from the date they were paid to the date of settlement.
But if theres still an outstanding balance, AvantCredit should treat Ms A positively 
and come to a reasonable repayment plan.
Remove any adverse information about the loan from Ms As credit file once the 
capital has been repaid.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires AvantCredit to take off tax from this interest. AvantCredit must 
give Ms A a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint and require AvantCredit of UK,LLC to 
put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms A to accept or 
reject my decision before 10 October 2022.
