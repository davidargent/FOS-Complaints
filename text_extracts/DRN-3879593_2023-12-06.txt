The complaint
Mr and Mrs T complain that Vacation Finance Limited wont refund to them the money that 
they paid for some holiday club membership credits. Theyre being represented in their 
complaint by a claims management company.
What happened
Mr and Mrs T had owned holiday products that theyd bought from a holiday company since 
July 2003. They entered into a membership application agreement in September 2019 to 
buy 24,000 level four holiday club membership credits from the holiday company. The 
membership price was £9,950, they paid a deposit of £1,495 and they entered into a fixed 
sum loan agreement with Vacation Finance for a loan of £8,455. They agreed to make 120 
monthly payments of £109.87 to Vacation Finance.
Mr and Mrs Ts representative, on behalf of Mr and Mrs T, made claims to Vacation Finance 
in January 2022 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It said, in 
summary and amongst other things, that: the membership credits were mis-sold to Mr and 
Mrs T and, but for the misrepresentations made to them, they wouldnt have purchased them 
nor entered into the loan agreement; the holiday company is in liquidation and cant provide 
the service sold so is in breach of contract; the terms of the agreement are so egregious as 
to be unfair; the payment of commission was hidden from view; the membership credits were 
marketed as an investment and were sold to Mr and Mrs T under extreme sales pressure 
and they werent given the opportunity to consider any other creditors; no affordability 
checks were carried out on Mr and Mrs Ts ability to afford the loan; and their relationship 
with Vacation Finance is unfair.
Vacation Finance responded to those claims in detail and said that it hadnt seen nor been 
presented with any evidence which would lead it to conclude that Mr and Mrs Ts 
membership credits were mis-sold or misrepresented to them at the time of purchase. It also 
said that it maintained that it lent to them in a responsible manner and didnt uphold any of 
the claims. 
Mr and Mrs T werent satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service. 
Their complaint form says: Vacation Finance paid a commission to the holiday company 
which wasnt declared to them; the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment 
of their ability to afford the loan; the holiday company unduly pressured them into entering 
into the membership application agreement and the loan agreement and used aggressive 
commercial practices to pressure them; the membership credits were misrepresented to 
them; the holiday company marketed and sold the credits as an investment in breach of the 
Timeshare Regulations; the holiday company is in liquidation so is in breach of contract; and 
they werent provided with key information necessary for them to be able to make an 
informed decision regarding their purchase; all rendering the loan agreement unfair under 
section 140A; and it says that their complaint should also be considered under section 75.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr and Mrs Ts complaint should be upheld. She 
didnt think that Vacation Finances decision to turn down Mr and Mrs Ts claims was unfair 
or unreasonable. She wasnt persuaded that there was a misrepresentation at the time of 
sale. She said that she hadnt seen enough to suggest that the relationship between Mr and 
Mrs T and Vacation Finance was unfair and she wasnt persuaded that a court would reach 
the conclusion that the relationship was unfair. She also said that she hadnt seen anything 
persuasive to suggest that the lending was unaffordable for Mr and Mrs T and that she didnt 
think that the holiday company had breached the contract.
Mr and Mrs Ts representative says that Mr and Mrs T arent accepting our investigators 
recommendation and requested that this matter be referred to an ombudsman for a decision. 
It has provided an addendum containing Mr and Mrs Ts additional arguments which says, in 
summary and amongst other things, that: the product was sold to Mr and Mrs T as an 
investment; the holiday company represented to them that trading-in their existing products 
for the membership credits was the only method of realising their investment on their earlier 
purchases; the re-sale scheme would be open for members five years following the start of a 
membership but existing members who exchanged products for membership credits were 
allowed to access the scheme within one year of first occupancy; the resale programme is 
now discontinued and the holiday company appears to have gone into administration; the 
products that Mr and Mrs T bought in October 2014 and June 2016 were also 
misrepresented to them; the holiday company breached the Timeshare Regulations and 
misrepresented the membership credits as something that could be re-sold easily in the 
future; and, were it not for the representations, Mr and Mrs T wouldnt have purchased the 
membership credits and traded-in their existing product.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with our investigator that Mr and Mrs Ts complaint shouldnt be 
upheld for these reasons:
the addendum containing Mr and Mrs Ts additional arguments describes the 
purchases of holiday products that Mr and Mrs T made between July 2003 and June 
2016 and includes copies of the membership application agreements for those 
purchases but their complaint only relates to the purchase that they made in 
September 2019 which they paid for using a loan provided by Vacation Finance;
Mr and Mrs T say that they exchanged two weeks of holiday club membership for the 
membership credits and they entered into a membership application agreement with 
the holiday company in September 2019 to buy 24,000 membership credits, but Ive 
not been provided with a copy of the agreement, just the summary that was sent to 
them by the holiday company and the summary shows that the membership price 
was £9,950 and that they paid a deposit of £1,495;
Ive also not been provided with a copy any of the other contractual documentation 
that its likely that Mr and Mrs T would have signed with the holiday company at that 
time;
Mr and Mrs T also entered into a loan agreement with Vacation Finance that they 
signed in September 2019 which shows that the cash price was £9,950 and an 
advance payment of £1,495 was made so the loan amount was £8,455;
Mr and Mrs Ts representative made claims to Vacation Finance in January 2022 
under sections 75 and 140A and a complaint was then made to this service: section 
75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or misrepresentation by 
the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that section are met); and section 
140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to repay 
any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that theres an 
unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
Im not determining the outcome of Mr and Mrs Ts claims under sections 75 and 
140A as only a court would be able to do that but Im considering whether or not 
Vacation Finances response to their claims was fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances;
the January 2022 claim letter says that it was represented to Mr and Mrs T by the 
holiday company before their September 2019 purchase that: their current product 
was unsellable as part of the re-sale scheme and that they would be required to 
purchase the membership credits if it was their intention to sell their product at a 
profit; the holiday company was ceasing to trade in timeshare apartments; benefits of 
the membership credits included that there would be no fixed time period when they 
would be required to access their holidays; the membership credits were an excellent 
investment; the annual maintenance fees would increase greatly if they didnt convert 
to the membership credits; and the membership credits were available for a greatly 
reduced discount price but only if purchased on that day; 
the claim letter says that those were false and misleading representations made to 
induce Mr and Mrs T into entering into the membership application agreement but the 
letter doesnt include a detailed account of the circumstances in which the alleged 
misrepresentations were made, the conversations that took place or the information 
that was provided to Mr and Mrs T before their September 2019 purchase;
none of Mr and Mrs T and their representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which it was represented to Mr and Mrs T that the membership 
credits were an investment, the conversations that took place, the information that 
was provided to them before their September 2019 purchase or any documentary or 
other evidence to show that it was represented to them that the membership credits 
were an investment;
I understand that the membership credits can be used for accommodation and 
experiences and Im not persuaded that its likely that the membership credits would 
properly be considered to be an investment and Im not persuaded that theres 
enough evidence to show that the membership credits were misrepresented to Mr 
and Mrs T as an investment, or that they were marketed or sold to them as an 
investment in breach of the Timeshare Regulations;
Mr and Mrs T say in their complaint form that the membership credits didnt provide 
the same level as their previous holiday products and they couldn't book two weeks 
using their membership credits without paying more money (but the holiday company 
didnt advise them of that discrepancy when they bought the membership credits and 
they couldnt afford to keep paying the extra charge so haven't used their 
membership credits);
theres no reference in the documents that Mr and Mrs T have provided from the time 
of sale to show that the holiday company had said that a resale scheme would be 
available and Ive seen no evidence to show any steps that Mr and Mrs T have taken 
to try to re-sell their membership credits;
none of Mr and Mrs T and their representative has provided a detailed account of the 
circumstances in which the other alleged misrepresentations were made, the 
conversations that took place or the information that was provided to them and which 
caused the membership credits to have been misrepresented to them;Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the holiday company 
misrepresented the membership credits to Mr and Mrs T, that they were mis-sold to 
them or that they were induced into buying them by any such misrepresentations;
the claim letter and Mr and Mrs Ts complaint form also say that the holiday company 
is in liquidation and cant provide the service sold so is in breach of contract, but 
Vacation Finance says the holiday clubs are now operated by a newly appointed club 
manager and full use of the membership credits remains available to all members 
who continue to make payment of the annual fees in line with their membership;
I consider that the liquidation of the holiday company could be a breach of contract 
for which Vacation Finance might have liability under section 75, but I consider the 
appointment of the new club manager to have been a suitable remedy for any such 
breach of contract and Ive seen no evidence to show that Mr and Mrs Ts use of their 
membership credits has been adversely impacted by the liquidation of the holiday 
company;
Mr and Mrs T say that they haven't used their membership credits but I understand 
that theyre available for them to use and Im not persuaded that theres enough 
evidence to show that theres been any other breach of contract, or any breach of 
any applicable regulation by the holiday company for which Vacation Finance would 
be liable under section 75 in these circumstances;
as well as claiming that the membership credits were misrepresented to Mr and 
Mrs T and that theres been a breach of contract, the January 2022 claim letter 
makes other claims, including that: the terms of the agreement are so egregious as 
to be unfair; the payment of commission was hidden from view; the membership 
credits were sold to Mr and Mrs T under extreme sales pressure and they werent 
given the opportunity to consider any other creditors; no affordability checks were 
carried out on Mr and Mrs Ts ability to afford the loan; and their relationship with 
Vacation Finance is unfair;
Mr and Mrs Ts complaint form says the membership credits were misrepresented to 
them, the holiday company marketed and sold the credits as an investment in breach 
of the Timeshare Regulations, and the holiday company is in liquidation so is in 
breach of contract  but it also says that Vacation Finance paid a commission to the 
holiday company which wasnt declared to them, the holiday company failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford the loan; the holiday company 
unduly pressured them into entering into the membership application agreement and 
the loan agreement and used aggressive commercial practices to pressure them; 
and they werent provided with key information necessary for them to be able to 
make an informed decision regarding their purchase;
Mr and Mrs Ts representative says that the terms of the agreement are so egregious 
as to be unfair  but it hasnt provided the terms and conditions or said which of the 
terms it considers to be unfair;
it would be for a court to determine whether or not any of the terms in the 
agreements that Mr and Mrs T entered into in September 2019 are unfair but I dont 
consider that the presence of an unfair (or potentially unfair) term alone is likely to 
mean that a court would conclude that it created an unfair relationship between a 
debtor and a creditor as the court would consider how the term operated in practice 
and whether the operation of that term caused the relationship to be unfair;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the terms of the 
documents have been applied or operated unfairly against Mr and Mrs T and I 
consider it to be unlikely that a court would conclude in these circumstances that the 
terms of the documents created an unfair relationship between Mr and Mrs T and Vacation Finance;
Mr and Mrs Ts representative says that the payment of commission was hidden from 
view and Mr and Mrs Ts complaint form says that Vacation Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mr and Mrs T, but 
Vacation Finance says that it has paid no commission to the holiday company and 
Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that Vacation Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company;
Mr and Mrs Ts representative says that no affordability checks were carried out on 
Mr and Mrs Ts ability to afford the loan and Mr and Mrs Ts complaint form says that 
the holiday company failed to conduct a proper assessment of their ability to afford 
the loan, but Vacation Finance says that it followed its usual process and conducted 
an appropriate affordability assessment;
Vacation Finance also said in January 2022 that Mr and Mrs T had successfully paid 
all instalments that had become due so its clear that affordability isnt an issue for 
them and none of Mr and Mrs T and their representative has provided any evidence 
to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr and Mrs T when it was made to them in 
September 2019;
Mr and Mrs Ts representative says that Mr and Mrs T werent given the opportunity 
to consider any other creditors but Vacation Finance says that Mr and Mrs T were at 
no point required to enter into the loan agreement, theres no stipulation that a loan 
must be taken from it and they were fully within their rights to make alternative 
arrangements to finance the product  it also says that the pre-contract credit 
information that was provided to them clearly provided other alternatives of financing; 
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for Mr and Mrs T when it was taken out, that the loan has caused them 
any financial difficulties, that the loan was mis-sold to them or that Vacation Finance 
has acted incorrectly in connection with the loan;
Mr and Mrs Ts representative says that the membership credits were sold to Mr and 
Mrs T under extreme sales pressure and Mr and Mrs Ts complaint form says that the 
holiday company unduly pressured them into entering into the membership 
application agreement and the loan agreement and used aggressive commercial 
practices to pressure them - but theyd bought holiday products from the holiday 
company in July 2003, July 2004, September 2005, August 2006, July 2012, October 
2014 and June 2016 so I would expect them to have been prepared for the sales 
tactics that might be used by the holiday company before they went into the sales 
presentation in September 2019 and that, if they didnt want to buy the membership 
credits, they would have made that clear to the holiday company at that time;
Mr and Mrs T had the right to withdraw from the membership application agreement 
and the loan agreement within fourteen days without giving any reason but Ive seen 
no evidence to show that they contacted either the holiday company or Vacation 
Finance to withdraw from either of those agreements within the withdrawal periods;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr and Mrs T were 
unduly pressured into entering into the membership application agreement or the 
loan agreement or that the holiday company used unacceptably aggressive 
commercial practices against them;
Mr and Mrs Ts representative has also referred to breaches by the holiday company 
of the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 
2010 and the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008  and the 
addendum containing Mr and Mrs Ts additional arguments says that the holiday 
company failed to provide the necessary information required by the regulations;none of Mr and Mrs T and their representative has identified the information that was 
necessary for Mr and Mrs T to make an informed decision regarding the purchase 
but wasnt provided to them by the holiday company and I dont consider that theyve 
provided all of the documentation that would have been provided to Mr and Mrs T at 
the time of the purchase;
Mr and Mrs T have made other purchases from the holiday company and I consider 
that it would be reasonable to expect them to have been aware of the information 
that they needed before they made a decision to buy the membership credits in 
September 2019 so Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that 
theres been a breach of either of those regulations;
having considered all of the information and evidence that Mr and Mrs T and their 
representative have provided, Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to 
show that Mr and Mrs Ts relationship with Vacation Finance was unfair and I dont 
consider it to be likely that a court would conclude that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr and Mrs T and Vacation Finance in these circumstances;
I sympathise with Mr and Mrs T for the issues that theyve had with their membership 
credits but I consider that Vacation Finances response to the claims that had been 
made to it was fair and reasonable; and
I find that it wouldnt be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to require 
Vacation Finance to refund to Mr and Mrs T any of the money that theyve paid under 
the loan agreement, to cancel their loan, to pay them any compensation or to take 
any other action in response to their complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr and Mrs Ts complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr and Mrs T to 
accept or reject my decision before 5 January 2024.
