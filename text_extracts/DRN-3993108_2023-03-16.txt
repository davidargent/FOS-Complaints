The complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc asked him to make unaffordable 
mortgage payments after it paid ground rent and service charges owed in relation to his 
leasehold property.
What happened
Mr A took out a mortgage with NatWest in 2017 with a 35-year term. Mr A had financial 
difficulties during the Covid-19 pandemic. He was unable to pay the ground rent and service 
charge for the security property (for simplicity, Im going to refer to this as the lease debt).
In 2021 the management company instructed solicitors to start action to recover the lease 
debt of about £7,500.
NatWest paid the lease debt with Mr As agreement. It wrote to Mr A saying hed have to 
repay the lease debt over 12 months. Mr As monthly mortgage payment increased to about 
£1,000 which Mr A says isnt affordable. Mr A says after speaking to NatWest in September 
2021 hed expected the repayments to be spread over the remaining term of the mortgage.
I sent a provisional decision to the parties explaining why I intended to uphold the complaint 
and setting out what I thought NatWest should do to put matters right. 
Mr A agreed with almost all of my provisional decision but asked that NatWest compensate 
him for an administration fee of £175 related to the authority for NatWest to pay the lease 
debt. He said he hadnt previously provided income and expenditure to NatWest because 
the only options it offered were unaffordable. He said he was willing to provide this 
information now, but NatWest hadnt contacted him since my provisional decision. Mr A 
asked if NatWest could arrange a face-to-face meeting at a branch. 
NatWest agreed with my provisional decision and to pay the £175 fee. It said Mr A hadnt 
provided his income and expenditure information, and he hadnt made any contribution to his 
mortgage since late 2021. NatWest said it hadnt contacted Mr A recently as wed asked it 
not to do so while the complaint was with us, and it didnt know he expected this. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr A was unable to pay the lease debt  the ground rent and service charge related to his 
leasehold property. This property was the security property for Mr As mortgage with 
NatWest. The management company instructed solicitors to start recovery action. Recovery 
action could result in forfeiture of the lease and put NatWests security at risk, although 
recovery action wasnt at that stage here. The solicitors acting for the management company 
wrote to NatWest about the lease debt and potential recovery action. The solicitors told Mr A 
one of his options was to approach NatWest for help.
Mr A spoke to NatWest in early September 2021. Mr A said he wanted to discuss adding the 
lease debt to the mortgage, but while he accepted he owed money to the management 
company he disputed the amount. NatWest wrote to Mr A in early September 2021. This 
letter said that if Mr A didnt resolve the matter with the management company it would make 
the payment to protect its security. It said it would require this to be repaid over 12 months.
Mr A called NatWest in late September 2021. Ive listened to a recording of this call. Mr A 
said hed been waiting for a call back from NatWest to explain the process if the lease debt 
was settled by NatWest. In particular, if the debt had to be repaid over 12 months. He said 
he needed it to be stretched over a longer period as his income was affected by the Covid-
19 pandemic. Mr A was told while in some cases NatWest required repayment within 12 
months this wasnt always the case, it depended on personal circumstances.
Mr A told NatWest during this call that hed returned an acknowledgement to the county 
court, meaning judgement wouldnt be entered in default and he had an extra 30 days to 
deal with the lease debt. Mr A told NatWest the amount claimed by the management 
company wasnt correct. He was concerned about the time, trouble and legal costs involved 
in disputing this. He said on the basis NatWest would spread the cost over the mortgage 
term hed bite the bullet and pay it.
Mr A signed and returned the admission letter relating to the lease debt in early October 
2021. NatWest wrote to Mr A saying it would pay the lease debt, and Mr A would have to 
make repayments over 12 months. Mr A contacted NatWest to say he signed the letter on 
the basis the repayments would be spread over the remaining mortgage term. He asked for 
an urgent call back.
NatWest records show it was aware in mid-October 2021 that Mr A might be in financial 
difficulty. He hadnt been able to maintain ground rent and service charge payments. His 
account was in two months arrears with a payment due (totalling about £1,100). It noted that 
Mr As interest rate product was due to expire at the end of October 2021 and hed applied 
for a new rate online. When NatWest spoke to Mr A, he said his income had been affected 
by the pandemic, but he could now clear the arrears and maintain payments going forward. 
He said he wanted to protect his credit file. Mr A made a payment of £800 on 1 November 
2021 and said he planned to pay the remaining £300 before mid-November 2021. It seems 
Mr A didnt make this payment, or any payments since then.
NatWest made the payment to the solicitors acting for the management company in late 
October 2021. It wrote to Mr A confirming this and that hed have to repay the debt over 12 
months. This increased his monthly payments from about £285 to more than £1,000.
Mr A called NatWest again saying this wasnt affordable and he was waiting to hear about 
his request that repayments were spread over a longer term. He made a complaint. Mr A 
said NatWest paying the ground rent wasnt his last resort and he had other options  such 
as to take out a loan or borrow from family.
Initially, NatWest said the lease debt had to be repaid within 12 months. I think this was 
unfair. NatWest discussed Mr As income and expenditure with him in January 2022. It 
established that repayments over 12 months or five years werent affordable. Payments over 
the remaining term appeared to be affordable. However, NatWest says Mr A didnt provide 
all of the requested information so this might not be accurate.
NatWest contacted Mr A again in March 2022 to discuss his options. NatWest told us 
options included extending the term of Mr As main mortgage account, as well as spreading 
repayments for the ground rent over five years. This combination would reduce his monthly 
payments. It said it would consider capitalising the arrears, although it says based on the information it had this might not be affordable.
I think that NatWest made errors here.
Mr A expected NatWest to spread repayment of the lease debt over the mortgage term. 
While NatWest didnt promise this it did say that this was a possibility. This was the basis on 
which Mr A signed the admissions letter.
Mr A told NatWest before it made the payment that hed agreed to this on the basis 
payments would be spread over the remaining term. He told NatWest repaying the debt over 
12 months wasnt affordable. Given Mr A was in arrears at that time, NatWest should 
reasonably have known there was a risk that repaying the lease debt over 12 months (or 
even five years) would be unaffordable.
I think NatWest should have contacted Mr A again, before making the payment to the 
solicitor. It should have made it clear that it would require repayments to be made over 12 
months or at most five years. It should have discussed with Mr A if this would be affordable 
and if he still wanted to go ahead or look into other options.
I dont think NatWest would have made the payment to the management company in 
October 2021 if Mr A hadnt signed the admissions letter. I dont think NatWests own criteria 
were at that time met for it to have made the payment under its own policy. And I dont think 
it would have been fair for it to do so as its security wasnt at serious risk at that time.
Mr A says NatWest gave him legal advice related to the admission letter. During the call in 
late September 2021 Mr A said he thought the amount being claimed by the management 
company was too high, but he was in a dilemma whether to dispute the amount. Mr A had to 
make this decision before sending the admissions letter. NatWest asked if hed told the 
solicitor hed spoken to about having proof hed made some of the payments being claimed. 
Mr A said hed speak to the solicitor acting for the management company again. I dont think 
NatWest was inappropriate in this aspect of the discussion. I noted in my provisional 
decision that Mr A could have been referring to a different call, but he didnt respond to say 
this was the case.
I dont think NatWest initially responded fairly to Mr As concerns after it had paid the debt. It 
should at least have considered whether it could spread the payments over five years (in 
accordance with its policy) and if this was affordable for Mr A. It did agree to consider this in 
early 2022, and to look into what options might be available.
How did NatWests error affect Mr A?
From what Mr A has said, if hed known that NatWest would require repayment over a short 
term hed have looked for other options. Hed have looked for a loan or borrowed from 
family. He might have taken the opportunity to dispute the amount being claimed by the 
management company. I cant now know if Mr A would have found the funds elsewhere. Or 
if disputing the lease debt would have resulted in it being reduced. Mr A did have some 
opportunity to dispute the amount being claimed by the management company before 
NatWest became involved.
But it seems to me that NatWest paying the lease debt to the management company despite 
knowing the repayments might be unaffordable and Mr A expressing his concerns about this, 
put Mr A into a very difficult position. He has unaffordable mortgage payments and arrears 
recorded on his credit file.
How should NatWest put things right?Its difficult now to arrange matters to put Mr A into the position he would have been in had 
NatWest given him correct information in late 2021. Hes lost the chance to dispute formally 
the amount of the lease debt. Its likely to be difficult for him to source other finance to repay 
the lease debt to NatWest with mortgage arrears recorded on his credit file.
Ive thought carefully about how this matter should be sorted out. Mr A says hes happy to 
pay the debt, provided this is arranged in a way thats affordable. I appreciate that this is 
outside NatWests policy. But I think in the particular circumstances here it would be fair and 
reasonable for NatWest to arrange for repayment of the lease debt to be spread over the 
mortgage term.
It's possible that the repayments wont be affordable for Mr A even when spread over the 
mortgage term. The increase in interest rates since late 2021 will have increased the risk of 
this. And Mr A hasnt made any payments to his mortgage account for 15 months and so his 
arrears and overall balance has increased. I think before re-working the mortgage account it 
would be reasonable for NatWest first to assess whether this will be affordable for Mr A. 
Mr A will need to provide the necessary information and evidence to NatWest for it to do this.
NatWest should offer a meeting with one of its mortgage advisers within 30 days of Mr A 
accepting my final decision with the aim of assessing affordability, and gathering information 
to look into Mr As options and what would be in his best interests. Both parties have said 
they are willing to do this. While Mr A would prefer NatWest to offer this as a face-to-face 
meeting at a branch, I dont think its reasonable to require it to do so. NatWest might want a 
mortgage adviser from a specialist team or with additional expertise to attend given the 
circumstances here, or it might not be possible to arrange a meeting at a branch near to 
Mr A at short notice.
NatWest should take into account what Ive said about re-working the mortgage account 
when assessing affordability. However, NatWest will need to be flexible, and it wont 
necessarily be fair for it to rigidly apply its usual affordability tests. It will need to consider 
Mr As best interests.
If repayments of the lease debt are assessed as affordable when spread over the remaining 
term, NatWest should re-work the mortgage account as if this had happened on 1 November 
2021. It should apply the same product that Mr A took out in his main mortgage account at 
that time.
Given Mr A hasnt made any payments since late 2021, its likely that, after re-working the 
mortgage account, there will be a shortfall. NatWest should give Mr A reasonable 
opportunity (at least 60 days after notifying him of the amount) to bring the mortgage account 
up to date.
I think its fair that NatWest pays compensation for the upset caused by its errors. I think 
£250 is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. NatWest has agreed to compensate Mr A 
for the £175 fee he paid related to the authority for NatWest to pay the lease debt. 
What if the repayments arent affordable, even when spread over the remaining term?
Its possible the repayments would remain unaffordable even when spread over the 
remaining term such that it wouldnt be in Mr As best interests for the mortgage to continue 
on that basis. That would present considerable difficulties for both parties in sorting out this 
matter. I dont think I can set out here what NatWest should do, as what options might be 
available will depend on a number of factors, including Mr As financial circumstances.
NatWest should consider what options it could offer to support Mr A, including the suggestions its already made about extending the term and/or capitalising arrears. Id ask 
NatWest to be flexible and creative when looking into what options it could offer Mr A, given 
its error has put him in this position.
Mr A might want to seek independent financial advice about his options, which could include 
a loan to repay the lease debt or re-mortgaging with another lender. If Mr A does choose to 
re- mortgage with another lender, I think it would be fair for NatWest to waive any early 
repayment charge that would otherwise apply to the product Mr A took out in late 2021.
What should NatWest do about the adverse data on Mr As credit file?
Credit files should present an accurate and fair picture of a persons commitments and how 
they manage their finances. I dont think mortgage arrears on Mr As credit file give a fair 
picture. Mr A found himself in this position, with unaffordable mortgage payments, due to 
NatWests unfair actions. And having mortgage arrears on his credit file would make it 
difficult for him to re-mortgage or access finance to repay the lease debt if he decides thats 
the best option.
I think that NatWest should arrange for the adverse data recorded following the increase in 
Mr As monthly payments in late 2021 to be removed from Mr As credit file. And NatWest 
should allow a reasonable period of time to sort out this matter as Ive directed, during which 
it shouldnt record further adverse data on Mr As credit file. 
This period will need to allow time for Mr A to meet with NatWests mortgage adviser and 
provide the requested income and expenditure information to NatWest. NatWest will need to 
assess the information and ask for further information if required, and discuss its proposals 
with Mr A.
If NatWest isnt able to offer a solution to Mr A, or if Mr A decides to apply elsewhere, this 
period will need to allow time for Mr As credit file to be cleared of adverse data related to the 
mortgage before he makes an application, and for the new lenders usual application 
timeframe. I suggested that five months would be a reasonable period, and asked the parties 
to comment.
NatWest said three months would be sufficient. Ive thought about this, and Id hope that this 
matter can be sorted out within three months. Mr As arrears are increasing, and its in his 
interests for this matter is sorted out as soon as possible. But, in fairness, this period needs 
to allow enough time for Mr A to consider what options (if any) NatWest can offer, and he 
might then need time to take advice and/or apply elsewhere. And not all applications 
progress smoothly. 
Taking all this into account, I think NatWest shouldnt record adverse data related to the 
mortgage for five months from the date of this decision. I must be clear that this wouldnt 
prevent NatWest from recording missed or late payments or arrears which occur after this 
period expires.
What happens now?
It isnt easy to give a clear direction here about how NatWest should put things right. Ive 
made some proposals which I hope will help the parties move forward.
NatWest is the cause of the problem here, and it should put things right. But any solution 
needs to be workable and in Mr As best interest. Mr A will need to engage with NatWest and 
he will need to provide the information NatWest asks for. It cant make a decision about what 
is affordable or in Mr As best interests if Mr A doesnt provide the information it needs to do this.
Im hopeful NatWest will offer proposals for a viable plan to help things move on. But if not, it 
needs to give Mr A reasonable time to look into other options. This could include raising 
funds (by borrowing from family or taking out a loan) to repay the lease debt, re-mortgaging 
or even selling the property. Again, I think a reasonable amount of time would be five months 
from the date of this decision.
If Mr A is unable to do this, NatWest would still have an obligation to treat him fairly if hes in 
financial difficulty and unable to repay his arrears (and the lease debt if not included in the 
arrears).   
My final decision
My decision is that National Westminster Bank Plc should pay £425 to Mr A, and take the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 14 April 2023.
