The complaint
Ms M complains that Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as MoneyBoat) was 
irresponsible to give her loans she couldnt afford.
What happened 
Ms M took out four loans with MoneyBoat - heres a table showing details: 
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Instalments Amount Highest
Repayment
1 14/12/2017 30/08/2018 3 £300.00 £131.48
2 03/09/2018 28/02/2019 6 £500.00 £149.85
3 08/03/2019 29/08/2019 6 £700.00 £203.79
4 09/09/2019 Outstanding 6 £1,200.00 £346.83
 
Ms M said that MoneyBoat didnt properly check affordability before lending to her. She told 
us that these loans put her into a debt spiral leading to repeat borrowing and made her 
financial situation worse.
When Ms M complained to MoneyBoat it didn't agree that it had done anything wrong and so 
she brought her complaint to us.
Our adjudicator felt that MoneyBoat shouldnt have provided any of these loans to Ms M as 
the checks MoneyBoat did showed that Ms M had at least three loans outstanding with other 
short-term lenders. So it wasnt likely that Ms M wouldve been able to sustainably repay 
loan 1  or any subsequent loans. 
Our adjudicator set out the steps she said MoneyBoat should take to put things right for 
Ms M. 
MoneyBoat mainly said it did proportionate checks  and that whilst we might say it 
should've looked at all the information it had, MoneyBoat said it was impractical to review 
every line of a credit file for every loan. MoneyBoat told us that in the early stages of a 
lending relationship its processes are automated.
MoneyBoat has asked for a review so this complaint comes to me to make a final decision. What I've decided - and why 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
MoneyBoat needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In 
practice this means that it shouldve carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms M 
could repay the loans in a sustainable manner. 
These checks could take into account a number of different things, such as how much was 
being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers income and expenditure. With this in 
mind, in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that MoneyBoat should fairly and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors 
include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income) 
 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
MoneyBoat was required to establish whether Ms M could sustainably repay her loans  not 
just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This 
is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue difficulties and 
in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while meeting other 
reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet the repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Ms complaint.MoneyBoat asked Ms M to provide details of her income and to tell MoneyBoat what she 
normally spent each month. Looking at what MoneyBoat recorded about Ms Ms income and 
expenditure, it appears Ms M told MoneyBoat she was spending around £200 on other 
credit, on top of her other regular monthly expenses, leaving her with more than £430 of 
disposable income when she was applying for loan 1.
But that information wasnt supported by the information shown on its credit checks that 
MoneyBoat sent to us. 
I think its fair to say that MoneyBoat could see that Ms M had been relying significantly on 
short term loans, including payday loans, for a while. 
And MoneyBoat could see from the credit checks it did that Ms M had multiple other short 
term high cost loans outstanding when she asked to borrow loan 1 from MoneyBoat  as 
well as information about a defaulted short term loan. 
This type of borrowing is intended to provide a short term fix in the event of temporary 
money problems. So I think the information MoneyBoat had gathered about Ms Ms credit 
history shouldve made MoneyBoat realise that it looked like Ms M was having problems 
managing her money. 
Ive carefully considered what MoneyBoat has said about this. But I think that the credit 
information it obtained should reasonably have led MoneyBoat to the conclusion that the 
information Ms M had provided about her finances wasnt reliable and that it was likely that 
Ms M was facing serious problems managing her money.
I dont think it was reasonable for MoneyBoat to conclude that it was likely that Ms M would 
be able to repay loan 1, or any subsequent loan, in a sustainable way. 
So Im upholding Ms Ms complaint about these loans. 
Putting things right  what MoneyBoat should do
If MoneyBoat has sold the outstanding debts it should buy these back before doing what I 
have outlined below. If MoneyBoat isnt able to buy the debts back then it should liaise with 
the new debt owner to achieve the following:
 
A. Add together the total of the repayments made by Ms M towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything it 
has already refunded.
 
B. Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms M which were 
considered as part of "A", calculated from the date Ms M originally made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
 
C. Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding 
loans and treat any repayments made by Ms M as though they had been repayments 
of the principal. If this results in Ms M having made overpayments then these should 
be refunded with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. MoneyBoat 
should then refund the amounts calculated in "A" and "B" and move to step "E". 
D. If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in "A" and "B" 
should be used to repay any balance remaining on outstanding loans and any 
principal already written-off. If this results in a surplus then the surplus should be paid 
to Ms M. However if there is still an outstanding balance then MoneyBoat should try 
to agree an affordable repayment plan with Ms M. 
 
E. Remove all adverse entries from Ms Ms credit file straightaway for loans 1, 2 and 3 
and for loan 4 once it is repaid.
 
* HM Revenue & Customs requires MoneyBoat to take off tax from this interest. MoneyBoat 
must give Ms M a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint and direct Evergreen Finance London Limited (trading as 
MoneyBoat) to take the steps set out above to put things right for Ms M.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 June 2020.
