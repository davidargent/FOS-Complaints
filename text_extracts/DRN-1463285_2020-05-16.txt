The complaint
Ms G says Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) gave her loans that she 
couldnt afford.
What happened 
Sunny gave Ms G 90 loans between August 2015 and March 2019 which ranged from £50 to 
£550. Theyve all been repaid.
Ms G complained that Sunny provided her with loans that were all unaffordable.
Sunny disagreed - but it offered to uphold Ms Gs complaint from loan 32 onwards.
Ms G wasnt happy with this offer and so she brought her complaint to us. One of our 
adjudicators investigated her complaint.
Our adjudicator didnt feel that shed seen enough to say it was unfair that Sunny had 
provided loans 1 - 11 to Ms G. But she thought that loan 12 onwards shouldnt have been 
provided  and she explained how shed come to this view. 
Our adjudicator also gave some detailed instructions about the way she thought Sunny 
should settle the complaint.

Sunny didnt agree with everything in our adjudicators view letter  but it said that after 
reviewing our adjudicators assessment and the information it held about the complaint it 
wanted to put forward a different settlement outcome. 
Sunny said it now believed it wouldve been prudent to have done things differently after 
Ms Gs 26th loan. And Sunny offered to uphold the complaint from loan 27 onwards. Sunny 
sent details showing how it had worked out the refund it was willing to pay Ms G in 
settlement of her complaint. 
We passed this information on to Ms G but as it falls short of our adjudicators recommended 
settlement Ms G has rejected the offer and shed like me to make a final decision. 
What I've decided - and why 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make sure Ms G could 
repay the loans in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind, in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might point to the fact that Sunny should fairly and reasonably have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors include:
 
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income)
 
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income)  
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
 
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
Sunny was required to establish whether Ms G could sustainably repay her loans  not just 
whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being affordable on this basis might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while 
meeting other reasonable commitments, as well as without having to borrow to meet the 
repayments. 
And it follows that a lender should realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered all of the arguments, evidence and information provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Gs complaint.
Ive looked at what it appears Ms G told Sunny about her financial circumstances and the 
repayment amounts she had to make for loans 1  11. I agree with the adjudicator that it 
wasnt wrong for Sunny to give Ms G these loans. And as it appears that Ms G hasnt raised 
any objection to the adjudicators recommendation in relation to these loans, I dont think that 
I need to say more about loans 1  11. 
Ive also looked at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Ms G, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans. Like our adjudicator, I dont agree it was 
reasonable for Sunny to provide loan 12. At this point, I think Sunny shouldve realised that it 
was clear from looking at Ms Gs borrowing history that she was likely having money 
problems. 
I say this because:
 
Ms G wasnt managing to repay her loans sustainably - she had taken out 12 loans in 
the 6 months or so since shed first borrowed from Sunny. I think this was a sign that 
she was having money problems 
 
the loan amounts went up and down  but this record of borrowing doesnt suggest 
that Ms G was asking to borrow because of a new need for a short term loan. Rather, 
I think this indicated that overall her financial circumstances hadnt improved and the 
signs were that she was struggling with debt 
when she asked for loan 12, Ms G had repaid 3 previous loans just 4 days earlier 
and she was still paying loans 10 and 11. This was now the fourth time that she had 
taken out 3 overlapping loans (loans 3,4 and 5 overlapped, loans 5,6 and 7 
overlapped and loans 7,8 and 9 overlapped)
 
Sunny shouldve realised this pattern of lending indicated that Ms G had become 
reliant on taking out short term high cost loans and that her borrowing had now 
become unsustainable   
 
I think that Ms G lost out when Sunny provided loan 12 because:
 
this loan had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Gs indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive credit intended for short-term use over an extended period of time 
 
the number of loans Ms G borrowed was likely to impact adversely on her ability to 
access mainstream credit and so kept Ms G in the market for high-cost loans. By 
loan 12 any further borrowing was likely to be detrimental to Ms Gs credit rating. 
 
So Im upholding Ms Gs complaint about loan 12 onwards.
Putting things right  what Sunny needs to do 
 
A) add together the total of the repayments made by Ms G towards interest, fees and 
charges on loans 12 - 90, but not including anything already refunded
 
B) calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Ms G which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Ms G originally made the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled
 
C) pay Ms G the total of A plus B
 
D the overall pattern of Ms Gs borrowing for loans 12 - 90 means any information recorded 
about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove these loans entirely from Ms Gs credit file. 
 
*HMRC requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. If Ms G asks Sunny for a certificate 
showing how much tax has been taken off, Sunny should provide this. My final decision
For the reasons given above, Im upholding Ms Gs complaint about loans 12 - 90. 
Elevate Credit International Limited (trading as Sunny) should take the steps Ive set out 
above to put things right.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms G to accept or 
reject my decision before 13 June 2020.
