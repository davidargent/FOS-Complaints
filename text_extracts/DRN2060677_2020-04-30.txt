K821x#15complaint
Mrs R says Elevate Credit International Limited, trading as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly 
lent to her. She says it didn't check whether she was able afford the borrowing it gave her.
background
I issued my provisional decision on 25 March 2020.  A copy of my provisional  decision is
attached and forms part of my final decision.
My provisional decision sets out the background to this complaint. It explains why I think  the 
complaint should  be partially upheld. I thought that if Sunny had looked  to build a picture of 
Mrs Rs financial  position when she took loan four it wasnt unreasonable to conclude that it 
wouldnt have given  any further borrowing. I also concluded that all information  about lending 
from loan nine onwards was adverse  and should  be removed from Mrs Rs credit file
Mrs R accepted my provisional  decision.  Sunny didnt  respond.  
my findings
Ive reconsidered  all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As Mrs R has accepted the provisional decision and Sunny hasnt given me anything more  
to consider, I see no reason to alter my provisional  decision  and confirm  those  findings.
For completeness, Ill repeat what Sunny  needs  to do to put the matter  right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
refund  all interest and charges Mrs R paid on loans four to 41;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans four to eight from Mrs Rs credit  file;
the number  of loans taken from loan nine onwards means  any information recorded 
about them  is adverse. So, all entries  about  loans  nine to 41 should be removed from 
Mrs Rs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs R a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if she asks for one.
my final decision
My final decision is that I partially uphold  Mrs Rs complaint. Elevate Credit International 
Limited should put things right as set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 May 2020.

complaint
Mrs R says Elevate Credit  International  Limited,  trading  as Sunny (Sunny), irresponsibly lent to her. 
She says it didn't check whether she was able afford the borrowing it gave her.
background
This complaint is about  41 short-term loans Sunny  provided to Mrs R between  March 2016 and June 
2017. Mrs Rs borrowing  history is attached as an appendix to this decision. 
Our adjudicator partially upheld Mrs Rs complaint and thought the loans  from loan five onwards 
shouldnt have been given. He also thought that any adverse information  about  loans five to eight 
should be removed  from Mrs Rs credit  file and that all information about loans  nine onwards was 
adverse so should be removed. 
Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold the complaint for the loans from loan 18 onwards.  The offer 
was put to Mrs R but she rejected it.
As the complaint remains  unresolved it has been passed to me to decide in my role as ombudsman.  
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.  
Sunny needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice  this 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to make  sure Mrs R could repay the loans  
in a sustainable manner. These checks could  take into account  a number of different things,  such as 
how much  was being lent, the repayment amounts and the consumers  income  and expenditure. With 
this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough checks might be 
reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly  and reasonably have done more  to 
establish that any lending was sustainable  for the consumer. These factors  include:
the lower a consumers income  (reflecting  that it could be more difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount  due to be repaid  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular  level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period  of time during 
which a customer has been given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may 
signal that the borrowing  had become,  or was becoming, unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think  that it is important  for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish  whether  Mrs R 
could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments were affordable  on a strict 
pounds and pence calculation.  
Ref: DRN20606774Of course, the loan payments being affordable on this basis  might be an indication a consumer could 
sustainably make  their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is the case. This is 
because the relevant regulations  define sustainable as being  without undue  difficulties and in 
particular, the customer should be able to make repayments on time, while  meeting  other reasonable 
commitments; as well as without having to borrow  to meet the repayments.  And it follows that a lender 
should realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise,  that a borrower  wont be able to make their 
repayments sustainably  if theyre unlikely  to be able to make their repayments without borrowing 
further. 
Our adjudicator didnt uphold Mrs Rs complaint about loans one to four and Mrs R didn't comment  on 
this. So I am not making any further findings  on loans one to three in this decision. But my current 
opinion is that loan four shouldnt have been given and should be upheld along with loans five to 41 
as recommended by the adjudicator. as Mrs R didn't comment  on this. 
I say this because when Mrs R took loan four, loan three was still running (loans one to four were  all 
taken in the same month and totalled £1,350). Loan three was for £500 and loan four for a further 
£400  the monthly repayments for both was £295. So looking  at the repayments for these  two loans 
when compared to Mrs Rs income information that Sunny has given us, this accounted for a 
significant portion of Mrs Rs income. And this was before taking  account of any essential 
expenditure. 
And I note Mrs Rs essential  expenditure figure was £300 at loan one but had been reduced to £175 
at loan two and remained  the same  until loan four  all within the same month.  So, I think at this point 
Sunny should have  looked  further  into Mrs Rs financial circumstances. And it could  have asked 
Mrs R why her expenditure  on 2 March was £300 for the month but had reduced to £175 for loans  two 
to four. 
If Sunny had looked to build a picture of Mrs Rs financial position  it could  have asked  for evidence of 
her income  and expenditure  copies  of wage  slips, bills or bank statements as examples.  If it had 
done so, it would have  seen Mrs Rs outgoings were significantly more than she had stated  her 
bank statements show significant use of on-line gambling websites.  
I can also see from the loan table that Mrs R had taken loan three the same day that loan one had 
been repaid, and for more  than double the amount.  And loan two was repaid  early, the day after it 
was taken.  This behaviour  could have been an indication Mrs R was having to juggle her finances and 
was borrowing further to repay current debt. 
So while Sunny could say it wasnt unreasonable for it to have relied upon  the information  Mrs R had 
provided, I think there was sufficient evidence in her borrowing behaviour to have caused Sunny  to 
gather more information  about her financial circumstances.  
Ive also looked at the overall  pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs R, with a view to seeing  if 
there was a point at which Sunny should  reasonably have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise  harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further  loans. 
Given the particular circumstances of Mrs Rs case, and like the adjudicator, I think that this point was 
reached by loan nine. I say this because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have  realised  Mrs R was not managing  to repay her loans 
sustainably. Mrs R had taken out nine loans  within  two months.  So Sunny ought to have 
realised it was more likely than not Mrs R was having to borrow further to cover  the hole 
repaying her previous loan was leaving  in her finances and that 
Mrs Rs indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ref: DRN20606775Mrs Rs first loan was for £200  and loan nine was for £400.  At this point Sunny ought  to have 
known that Mrs R was not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in their income but to 
meet an ongoing need. 
Mrs R wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 41 was taken out 
15 months after Mrs Rs first. Mrs R had paid large amounts of interest to, in effect, service a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think  that Mrs R lost out because Sunny continued to provide  borrowing from loan nine onwards 
because:
these  loans had the effect of unfairly  prolonging  Mrs Rs indebtedness by allowing her to take 
expensive credit  intended for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number of loans and the length  of time over which Mrs R borrowed  was likely to have had 
negative implications  on Mrs Rs ability  to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the 
market for these  high-cost  loans.
So Im also upholding the complaint about loan four to 41 and Sunny should put things right.
putting things  right  what Sunny needs to do
refund all interest and charges Mrs R paid on loans  four to 41;
pay interest of 8% simple a year on any refunded interest and charges  from the date they 
were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information about loans  four to eight from Mrs Rs credit file;
the number of loans taken from loan nine onwards means any information  recorded  about  
them is adverse. So all entries about loans nine to 41 should be removed  from Mrs Rs credit  
file.
 HM Revenue & Customs  requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest.  Sunny must  give Mrs R a 
certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if she asks for one.
my provisional  decision
My provisional  decision  is that I propose to partially  uphold Mrs Rs complaint.
Please could  Elevate Credit International Limited and Mrs R send me any more information or 
comments for to look at by 25 April 2020. After that, Ill issue my decision.
