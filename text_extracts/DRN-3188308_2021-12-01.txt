The complaint
Mr C complains that Madison CF UK Limited (trading as 118 118 Money) irresponsibly lent 
to him.  
What happened
I set out the background to this complaint in my provisional decision of 12 November 2021. 
In my provisional decision I explained that after reviewing this complaint, I was inclined to 
reach different conclusions to our investigator. Excerpts from my provisional decision are 
below;
Ive carefully thought about all of the relevant factors in this case.
118 118 Money has provided evidence to show that before lending loans 1 to 3, it searched Mr 
Cs credit file, asked him about his monthly income and expenditure, including his credit 
commitments. Also, I can see that before lending loan 1, 118 118 Money saw Mr Cs bank 
statements for the previous two months and completed a pre agreement call with Mr C. 118 118 
Money has provided information to show that it asked Mr C about his income and expenses 
before lending loan 4.
I think 118118 Money did enough before agreeing to lend loan 1. Ive now gone on to 
consider whether it made a fair lending decision based on those checks.
118118 Money confirmed that Mr C was self-employed, so there was likely to be an issue with his 
income fluctuating. The bank statements it obtained showed that over a three-month period, Mr Cs 
income was about £3,400 on average, there were no defaults or county court judgements on Mr 
Cs credit file. Mr Cs living costs including credit repayments were around £2,070. This suggests 
that he had sufficient funds to maintain the repayment of this loan over the term. So, I dont think 
118 118 Money was wrong to lend loan 1.
There was over a six-month gap between when Mr C repaid loan 1 and when he borrowed loan 
2. The reason for loan 2 is recorded as debt consolidation but I cant see that 118 118 Money 
has considered how the consolidation would have impacted Mr Cs overall financial 
circumstances.
Mr C declared £3,000 as his income and his expenses including credit commitments as
£1,580. However, I think 118 118 Moneys checks showed that Mr C had declared a significantly 
lower figure for his credit commitments. Mr C declared his regular credit commitments as £330 but 
the results of the credit checks show that Mr C was likely to repay over £1,000 towards credit each 
month including this loan. I think this large difference should have prompted 118 118 Money to 
have taken its checks further. And so, I dont think it did enough before lending loan 2. 118 118 
Money should have been looking to get a better understanding of Mr Cs financial circumstances 
and it needed to take it checks further before lending.
Ive reviewed Mr Cs bank statements from around the time of loan 2 and I can see that Mr C was 
borrowing from other high cost loans. For example, in the June 2018, the month before the loan 
was granted, Mr C spent around £2,000 repaying other high cost lenders and had around £1,864 
outstanding to these lenders too. Also, Mr C had other regular credit commitments on things like 
hire purchase and credit card payments that were around £700. For the outstanding loans to other 
high cost lenders, it appears Mr C was due to repay around £361 monthly and so his monthly credit 
commitments would have been around £1,061.
Im also conscious that in that same month, Mr Cs gross income was around £4,500, higher than 
his income at the time of the previous loan. So, taking into account his income and his monthly 
expenses including credit commitments, it seems Mr C would have had sufficient income to repay 
this loan. I think even if 118 118 Money had taken it checks further, it would still have lent to Mr C.
For loans 3 and 4, I dont 118 118 Money did enough before agreeing the lend. I say this 
because loan 3 was taken within 6 months of loan 2 and was used to repay that loan. The credit 
search results also showed that Mr C had taken out more credit between both loans and so 
there were signs that Mr C may have been under financial pressure at this point. I think 118 118 
Money should have looked to verify Mr Cs circumstances further before agreeing to lend. The 
position was also similar for loan 4 and 118 118 Money should also have done more before 
lending.
Further checks at the time of loan 3 would have shown that Mr Cs income was around
£2,500. I can see that Mr Cs level of indebtedness had increased and he took out a new loan with 
another lender a few days before this loan, including the repayment of this loan, Mr C was due to 
repay around £1,225. I think bearing in mind the significant reduction in his income and the 
increase in his credit commitments, there was a significant risk that Mr C would struggle to repay 
this loan and 18 118 Money shouldnt have lent to him here.
Mr C was in a similar position at the time of loan 4, he was now borrowing from about five other 
lenders including continued use of his credit cards. Mr C had again requested borrowing from 118 
118 Money within six months of the previous loan. 118 118 Money should have been aware that Mr 
C was now likely reliant on credit and that further borrowing would have had significant adverse 
effect on his finances and it shouldnt have lent him this loan.
Overall, while I think 118 118 Money wasnt wrong to lend loans 1 and 2, I dont think it 
should have lent loans 3 and 4.
Did 118 118 Money act unfairly or unreasonably in some other way?
Ive carefully thought about everything provided. And having done so, Ive not seen anything to 
suggest that 118 118 Money acted unfairly or unreasonably towards Mr C in some other way.
As 118 118 Money has lent to Mr C when it shouldnt have, and I think hes lost out and so it needs 
to put things right.
 
I gave both parties the opportunity to provide any further comments and arguments 
before I made a final decision. The deadline for response has now passed.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Both 118 118 Money and Mr C have responded to my provisional decision and have 
accepted my findings.
Based on that I see no reason to depart from my provisional decision and 118 118 Money 
needs to put things right for Mr C in relation to loans 3 and 4.  
Putting things right  what 118 118 Money needs to do
remove all interest and charges applied to loans 3 to 4;
treat all payments made by Mr C as payments towards the capital amount of 
both loans;
if this results in an overpayment pay interest of 8% simple a year on any 
overpayments from the date they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
if theres still a balance outstanding, 118 118 Money should come to a 
suitable repayment arrangement with Mr C.
remove any negative information about loans 3 and 4 from Mr Cs credit file.
 
My final decision
I uphold Mr Cs complaint about loans 3 and 4 and require Madison CF UK Limited to put 
things right as set out above.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision before 29 December 2021.
