The complaint
Mr T complains that he was unable to make a transaction on a credit card that was supplied 
to him through NewDay Ltd trading as Fluid Credit Card (NewDay). Mr T also complains 
that NewDay Ltd trading as Fluid Credit Card hadnt taken into consideration his vulnerable 
status.
What happened
Mr T explained that on 23 November 2021, his NewDay credit card was declined as he tried 
to use it for a transaction for £12.83.   
Mr T complained to NewDay that same day. He said that he felt humiliated and pointed out 
that he is a registered vulnerable person, with protected characteristics to safeguard his 
mental and physical health. Mr T said he wanted NewDay to apologise for the situation.
On 1 December 2021 NewDay provided their final response to Mr Ts complaint. NewDay 
advised that the card Mr T had tried using had been reported as lost or stolen earlier on in 
the year. NewDay explained that a new card had been ordered for Mr T at the time. NewDay 
said as they hadnt made any errors concerning Mr Ts account management, they wouldnt 
be upholding his complaint.
Unhappy with their response Mr T brought his complaint to us. One of our investigators 
looked into Mr Ts concerns and didnt uphold his complaint. Our investigator didnt think that 
NewDay had done anything wrong as Mr T had tried to use a card that had already been 
cancelled. 
Mr T responded to our investigators view to say that he felt his vulnerable status hadnt 
been taken into consideration. Our investigator responded to say that hed taken into 
consideration Mr Ts protected characteristics and status as a vulnerable consumer but still 
felt that NewDay hadnt done anything wrong.
Mr T disagreed with our investigators view, so the complaint has been referred to an 
ombudsman for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In considering what is fair and reasonable, Ive thought about all the evidence and 
information provided afresh and the relevant law and regulations, regulators rules, guidance 
and standards, codes of practice and (where appropriate) what I consider to have been good 
industry practice at the relevant time. 
From the information provided its clear to me that Mr T had a transaction declined on 23 
November 2021. This is apparent from the screenshots provided by NewDay detailing the 
transaction. Having considered the transaction was declined, it seems to me there are two 
key issues for me to consider in relation to this complaint:
1. Was it fair that Mr Ts transaction had been declined?
2. Should NewDay have done more in consideration of Mr Ts vulnerable status?
In their file submission to us NewDay provided screenshots showing that a transaction on Mr 
Ts credit card for £12.87 had been declined on 23 November 2021. They also sent us 
evidence from their records which showed that the card Mr T used for that transaction had 
been reported as lost or stolen in May 2021. NewDay also provided evidence from their 
system records that a replacement card had been ordered at the same time. 
Based on the evidence provided, Im satisfied that NewDay werent at fault for the declined 
transaction. As the card had been reported as lost or stolen in May 2021, Im satisfied that it 
was right that any transaction carried out on that card should be declined. Mr T said that the 
store assistant said there was a message requesting that Mr T hand the card into the store. 
As the card had been reported as lost or stolen, I think its reasonable for that instruction to 
be displayed to ensure the card is retained and destroyed to prevent any further use. 
I acknowledge this would have presented Mr T with an embarrassing experience; however, 
Im satisfied that NewDay hadnt acted unfairly by declining the transaction. 
Ive gone on to consider whether NewDay could have done more in light of Mr Ts vulnerable 
status.
In his response to our investigators view, Mr T says that he disagreed with it because it 
didnt take into consideration his protected characteristics disabilities. And in his complaint to 
NewDay, after saying hed been humiliated, Mr T pointed out that his mental and physical 
health are to be safeguarded by his protected characteristics. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) defines a vulnerable consumer as someone who 
due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to detriment, particularly when 
a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care
The FCA also produced guidance for firms on the fair treatment of vulnerable customers 
which included understanding vulnerability, the skills and capability of staff, taking 
practical action and monitoring and evaluation. 
Having considered the circumstances surrounding the declined transaction and the 
guidance provided by the FCA, Ive not seen any evidence that makes me think that 
Mr T hadnt been treated fairly by NewDay. As the transaction took place in a retail 
store, I dont think itd be reasonable to hold NewDay responsible for how Mr T may 
have felt at the time. Particularly as I consider that NewDay acted fairly in ensuring 
any transactions on the card which had been reported as lost or stolen wouldnt go 
through. 
In addition, Mr T also hasnt provided us with any specific details of his 
vulnerabilities or how he feels NewDay hadnt taken them into consideration.
I recognise that being vulnerable can present itself in a variety of ways and can 
significantly impact a persons physical and mental wellbeing. I also acknowledge 
that the situation would have been unpleasant for Mr T. However, from the evidence provided Im satisfied that NewDay hadnt done anything wrong in the circumstances 
and so I wont be asking them to do anything in respect of this complaint.
My final decision
Having thought about everything above, along with what is fair and reasonable in the 
circumstances, my final decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ts complaint against NewDay Ltd 
trading as Fluid Credit Card.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr T to accept or 
reject my decision before 24 April 2022.
