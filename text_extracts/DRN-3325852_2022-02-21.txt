The complaint
Mr B complains that AFH Independent Financial Services Limited (AFH) didnt inform him of 
changes to the management of his Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP). 
What happened
In 2017, Mr B was advised by his Independent Financial Adviser (IFA) to transfer several of 
his personal pensions into a SIPP. The SIPP was held by one provider. But a Discretionary 
Fund Management (DFM) service was provided by a different company. An annual fee of 
0.36% was charged for the provision of the DFM service.
In 2018, the IFAs firm was bought by AFH. Mr Bs IFA transferred over to AFH in January 
2018. Mr B was offered AFHs Interim Advisory Service. And was told that his IFA would 
provide him with further details of AFHs available service propositions. The service was to 
have an ongoing adviser charge of 0.5% each year. 
Mr B was told several times that there would be no change to the services that were 
provided through AFH due to the change in ownership of the IFA firm. So he felt that hed 
still benefit from the DFM service.
However, this wasnt correct. The company which provided the SIPP said that the company 
which had provided the DFM service had been removed due to the substitution of a new 
contract for an old one. The SIPP provider didnt inform AFH of this. And AFH didnt inform 
Mr B of this change.
Mr B particularly valued the service provided by the DFM. They regularly reviewed his SIPP, 
buying and selling assets to maintain a consistent risk profile. When his IFA transferred to 
AFH, Mr B had been told nothing would change. So Mr B still thought that his SIPP was 
being managed by the DFM. But in reality, his SIPP funds werent being rebalanced and his 
investment strategy wasnt being reviewed.
Between February 2018 and July 2019, AFH sent a number of emails to Mr B. None of these 
emails ever noted that Mr B no longer had access to the DFM service he thought he still had. 
During this time, there were discussions about Mr B moving to AFHs preferred DFM, but no 
formal advice was issued. Nor did AFH tell Mr B that there was no longer a DFM service 
attached to his SIPP. Mr B raised concerns over the performance of his SIPP on more than 
one occasion over this period. But AFH still didnt notice that his SIPP was no longer being 
managed in the way he expected. 
In February 2020, Mr B found out from the SIPP provider that the company which had 
provided the DFM service hadnt been providing that service since February/March 2018. He 
asked AFH to explain whatd happened. AFH confirmed that his DFM had ceased to provide 
services to him in 2018. The IFA said: this was as a result of [the DFM] ceasing offering its 
services and is nothing to do with myself joining AFH. The IFA went on to note that since 
hed moved to AFH hed recommended that Mr B should move to the alternative DFM 
services provided by AFH. But that Mr B hadnt decided to do that.
In March 2020 Mr B complained to AFH. He said that his IFA shouldve known what had 
happened. AFH didnt uphold the complaint. They said that the SIPP provider had removed 
Mr Bs DFM from his account without informing them. They felt that AFH had fulfilled their 
obligations as set out in the Interim Client Agreement. They recognised that an error had 
occurred. But held the SIPP provider responsible for it.
Mr B didnt agree. So he brought his complaint to this service.
Our investigator felt that his complaint should be upheld. He felt that AFH had provided a 
poor service by not informing Mr B of the change. Or contacting the SIPP provider and 
asking whether things would remain in place after the acquisition. He felt that AFH had 
caused Mr B distress and inconvenience and that they should give him £250 compensation. 
AFH agreed with our investigator. 
Mr B didnt agree. He said he didnt believe that AFH had provided the service hed paid for. 
He said that despite several discussions, at no stage did his IFA investigate or discover that 
his fund was no longer being managed. He felt that at the very least AFH should fully refund 
the fees hed paid since the DFM had been removed from his account. 
Mr B also said that if hed been told that his DFM would be removed hed have moved his 
SIPP. He said that hed always believed that his SIPP was still being managed by his DFM, 
as his IFA had told him that nothing would change.
So this complaint has come to me for review.
Mr B confirmed to this service in September 2021 that his SIPP is still held with the same 
provider. But that he removed AFH as his financial advisers in February 2021. 
I issued my provisional decision on 21 September 2021. It said: 
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. 
I intend to uphold this complaint. But I intend to recommend a different resolution to that put 
forward by our investigator. Ill explain why. 
Theres no dispute that AFH didnt tell Mr B that his DFM provider had been removed from 
his SIPP account. 
What is in dispute is whether or not AFH shouldve known. And shouldve told him. If I find 
that AFH shouldve known and told Mr B, it follows that theyll need to put him back, as 
closely as possible, to the position he wouldve been in had they told him that his DFM 
provider had been removed from his SIPP account as soon as they shouldve known.
AFH agree that there was an error. But have said that the SIPP provider is responsible for it. 
Based on the evidence Ive seen, I consider that AFH should also have known. Ill explain 
why.
From the correspondence both Mr B and AFH have shared with us, its clear that Mr Bs IFA 
didnt know that DFM services were no longer being provided. Ive included extracts from 
communications between Mr B and AFH to evidence this point below:
-6 February 2018 Mr Bs IFA told him that the move to AFH would be: Business as 
usual-25 April 2018 AFH told Mr B: [The DFM] do automatically adjust the funds to achieve 
better returns for your investment
-30 April 2018 Mr Bs IFA told him: You will not be affected in any way by the move 
to AFH. He also said: Their [the DFM] intention is always to achieve good returns 
and if necessary they will alter the funds automatically 
-10 August 2018 Mr B told his IFA: I am concerned about my pension fund and its 
performance during the last year I thought that with management by [the DFM] and 
[the SIPP provider] I would have had better results
-6 September 2018 Mr B had a meeting with his IFA where he said the removal of the 
DFM wasnt mentioned 
-14 January 2019 Mr B told his IFA: We are looking forward to receiving information 
to support your recommendations to move my pension fund from [the SIPP provider] 
and [the DFM] to AFH. together with any additional costs that will be incurred, as 
discussed at our last meeting. 
-9 May 2019 Mr B told his IFA: Following our meeting and as we asked in January, 
we are looking forward to receiving evidence to support your recommendation to 
move my pension fund manager from [the DFM] to AFH, together with information on 
any additional costs that would be incurred.
-31 May 2019 Mr B told his IFA: I said at our last meeting that I was concerned that I 
couldnt see any active management of my funds with [the SIPP provider], although I 
understood that [the DFM] were managing the fund. Your response was to move the 
management to AFH which we requested back-up information for.
-4 July 2019 Mr Bs IFA provided research on various options and associated costs of 
moving from [the DFM] 
-19 February 20 Mr B told his IFA: I have just spoken to [the SIPP provider] and was 
shocked to discover that the last payment to [the DFM] was made in February 2018. 
Needless to say, I am surprised and extremely disappointed to find this out, 
especially as you said that your move to AFH would not affect our investment in any 
way.
-26/2/20 Mr Bs IFA confirmed that the DFM stopped providing services to Mr B in 
2018.
From the above, its clear that there were a number of occasions when Mr B was told his 
DFM was still in place. So its not surprising that when Mr B became concerned by the 
performance of his SIPP, he thought that his DFM wasnt doing a good job. In fact, he had 
no DFM associated with his SIPP. 
Even when Mr B queried the performance, AFH didnt find out that he no longer had a DFM. 
And when he repeatedly asked them for supporting evidence for their recommendation to 
move to AFHs replacement DFM, it took months and several reminders from Mr B for that to 
be provided.
I also think that it shouldve been obvious to his IFA during any review of Mr Bs SIPP 
account that he was no longer being charged the 0.36% annual fee for the DFM service. And 
that the SIPP itself was no longer being rebalanced. Nor was the investment strategy being 
changed in any way. So I dont agree with AFHs view that the SIPP provider was responsible for the situation Mr B found himself in 2 years after the change of IFA firm.
I acknowledge that AFH said that Mr Bs valuations from the SIPP provider stated: 
Discretionary Manager. But I still consider that AFH shouldve done more to confirm that 
there really would be no changes to Mr Bs SIPP arrangements if he agreed to join their 
Interim Advisory Service. AFH were charging 0.5% per year for their ongoing advice. And I 
consider that they shouldve known they didnt have access to the DFM through the SIPP 
provider.
Having looked at all the evidence, Im persuaded that AFH shouldve known that the DFM 
wouldnt be available to Mr B. And that they shouldve told him so that he could make an 
informed decision on what to do next. 
Given this, I consider that AFH should put Mr B back, as closely as possible, to the position 
he wouldve been in had they told him that his DFM provider would be removed from his 
SIPP account.
So I need to decide what I consider Mr B wouldve chosen to do if hed been told about the 
removal of his DFM before accepting AFHs Interim Advisory Service. Ill address fair 
compensation later in my decision.
In addition, I intend to ask AFH to compensate Mr B for the trouble and upset theyve caused 
him. Despite him expressing performance concerns on a number of occasions, AFH didnt 
realise that a fundamental aspect of Mr Bs SIPP management had been removed. It 
mustve caused Mr B considerable distress when he eventually found out whatd happened, 
some two years after the event. So I agree with our investigator that £250 is reasonable 
compensation under the circumstances.
But I dont think it would be fair or reasonable to also direct AFH to refund the fees its 
collected. The above redress proposal is designed to put Mr B, as closely as possible, in the 
position he wouldve been had no errors been made. And that wouldve included payment of 
adviser fees.
To sum up, I intend to uphold Mr Bs complaint. I intend to ask AFH to put Mr B, as closely 
as possible, back to the position he wouldve been in if hed known the DFM would be 
removed from his SIPP. And I intend to ask them to pay him £250 compensation for the 
trouble and upset theyve caused him.
Fair compensation
My aim is that Mr B should be put as closely as possible into the position he would probably 
now be in if he had been given suitable advice. 
I think Mr B wouldve invested differently. Its not possible to say precisely what he wouldve 
done, but Im satisfied that what Ive set out below is fair and reasonable given Mr B's 
circumstances and objectives when he invested.
What should AFH do?
To compensate Mr B fairly, AFH must:
Compare the performance of Mr B's investment with that of the benchmark shown. If 
the fair value is greater than the actual value, there is a loss and compensation is 
payable. If the actual value is greater than the fair value, no compensation is payable.
AFH should add interest as set out below.If there is a loss, AFH should pay into Mr B's pension plan to increase its value by the 
amount of the compensation and any interest. The amount paid should allow for the 
effect of charges and any available tax relief. Compensation should not be paid into 
the pension plan if it would conflict with any existing protection or allowance.
If AFH is unable to pay the compensation into Mr B's pension plan, it should pay that 
amount direct to him. But had it been possible to pay into the plan, it wouldve 
provided a taxable income. Therefore the compensation should be reduced to 
notionally allow for any income tax that would otherwise have been paid. 
The notional allowance should be calculated using Mr B's actual or expected 
marginal rate of tax at his selected retirement age. 
For example, if Mr B is likely to be a basic rate taxpayer at the selected retirement 
age, the reduction would equal the current basic rate of tax. However, if Mr B 
wouldve been able to take a tax-free lump sum, the reduction should be applied to 
75% of the compensation.
Pay Mr B £250 for the trouble and upset they've caused him.
Income tax may be payable on any interest paid. If AFH deducts income tax from the 
interest, it should tell Mr B how much has been taken off. AFH should give Mr B a tax 
deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.

Actual value
This means the actual amount payable from the investment at the end date. 
Fair value
This is what the investment would have been worth at the end date had it produced a return 
using the benchmark.
To arrive at the fair value when using the fixed rate bonds as the benchmark, AFH should 
use the monthly average rate for one-year fixed-rate bonds as published by the Bank of 
England. The rate for each month is that shown as at the end of the previous month. Those 
rates should be applied to the investment on an annually compounded basis. Any additional sum that Mr B paid into the investment should be added to the fair value 
calculation at the point it was actually paid in. 
Any withdrawal, income or other distribution out of the investment should be deducted from 
the fair value calculation at the point it was actually paid so it ceases to accrue any return in 
the calculation from that point on. If there is a large number of regular payments, to keep 
calculations simpler, Ill accept if AFH totals all those payments and deducts that figure at the 
end instead of deducting periodically. 
Why is this remedy suitable?
Ive chosen this method of compensation because:
The average rate for the fixed rate bonds would be a fair measure for someone who 
wanted to achieve a reasonable return without risk to his capital. 
The FTSE UK Private Investors Income total return index (prior to 1 March 2017, the 
FTSE WMA Stock Market Income total return index) is made up of a range of indices 
with different asset classes, mainly UK equities and government bonds. Its a fair 
measure for someone who was prepared to take some risk to get a higher return. 
I consider that Mr B's risk profile was in between, in the sense that he was prepared 
to take a small level of risk to attain his investment objectives. So, the 50/50 
combination would reasonably put Mr B into that position. It does not mean that Mr B 
would have invested 50% of his money in a fixed rate bond and 50% in some kind of 
index tracker investment. Rather, I consider this a reasonable compromise that 
broadly reflects the sort of return Mr B could have obtained from investments suited 
to his objective and risk attitude. 
Response to my provisional decision
AFH agreed with my proposed decision for the most part. But disagreed with the end date of 
the calculation. They said that Mr B was aware at the point he complained to them that his 
funds hadnt been managed. And that the replacement adviser hed requested, and theyd 
arranged for him, had outlined the various options open to him. So they considered that the 
end date of the calculation should be the date theyd received Mr Bs original complaint. 
They said that at this point, hed been aware of the issue but didnt take any further action.
I carefully considered what AFH said. And I can see why they dont agree that the end date I 
proposed was fair under the circumstances. But I dont quite agree that we should use the 
date Mr B originally complained to AFH as the end date for the calculation. Instead, I 
consider that we should use the date AFH sent Mr B their final response letter to that 
complaint, 7 May 2020.
My rationale for this is that AFH now largely accepts my proposed decision, which indicates 
that they agree that they did something wrong. They couldve reached this conclusion in their 
final response letter. So I feel that a fair end date for the calculation should be linked to that. 
I acknowledge that Mr B knew what had happened  and therefore couldve taken mitigating 
steps  from February 2020 when he first discovered that there was no longer a DFM 
service attached to his SIPP. But I consider that it was reasonable for Mr B to have first 
complained to AFH to see what they would do to put things right, before deciding what steps 
to take himself. I say this because Mr B wouldve needed to be clear about exactly what had 
happened, before he was in a position to take mitigating steps. I asked both Mr B and AFH if they accepted 7 May 2020 as the end date for the calculation. 
They both agreed. 
AFH proposed that if Mr B agreed, they intended to issue the redress directly.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Both parties have agreed to an amended end date of 7 May 2020 for the redress calculation 
I proposed in my provisional decision. So I remain of the view I set out in my provisional 
decision, except for the amended end date.
Putting things right
My aim is that Mr B should be put as closely as possible into the position he would probably 
now be in if he had been given suitable advice. 
I think Mr B wouldve invested differently. Its not possible to say precisely what he wouldve 
done, but Im satisfied that what Ive set out below is fair and reasonable given Mr B's 
circumstances and objectives when he invested.
What should AFH do?
To compensate Mr B fairly, AFH must:

the fair value is greater than the actual value, there is a loss and compensation is 
payable. If the actual value is greater than the fair value, no compensation is payable. 
AFH should add interest as set out below.
If there is a loss, AFH should pay into Mr B's pension plan to increase its value by the 
amount of the compensation and any interest. The amount paid should allow for the

the pension plan if it would conflict with any existing protection or allowance.
If AFH is unable to pay the compensation into Mr B's pension plan, it should pay that

For the reasons given above, I uphold this complaint. I require AFH Independent Financial

Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 21 March 2022.
