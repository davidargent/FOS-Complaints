The complaint
Miss M complains that Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money provided her with 
loans that she was unable to afford to repay.    
What happened
118 118 Money provided Miss M with three loans as follows:
Date 
takenAmount Term Monthly 
repaymentAmount 
receivedDate repaid
Loan one 
(995585)21/12/2017 £1,425.24 12
months£118.77 £1,000 25/06/2018
Loan two 
(2062123)25/06/2018 £1,894.80 12
months£157.90 £1,338.30 24/12/2018
Loan three 
(2190790)24/12/2018 £2,114.28 12
months£176.19 £1,486.44 outstanding
 
As can be seen the second and third loans repaid respectively the first and second loan. 
Miss M says she advised 118 118 Money of her difficulties in making the repayments, and 
clearly couldnt afford the payments on the second and third loans which pushed her further 
into debt. She was unable to make the payments for the third loan and tried to arrange a 
payment plan with 118 118 Money. However it then assigned the loan to a third party who 
instructed a debt collection service.
On referral to this service our adjudicator said that 118 118 Moneys credit checks should 
have led it to carry out further checks of Miss Ms income and outgoings. If it had, it would 
have found that Miss M was unlikely to be able to afford a further loan, let alone the first two 
loans.
118 118 Money accepted the decision regarding the third loan, but pointed out, with regard 
to loan one, that Miss Ms credit cards werent over the limit. With regard to both loans it said 
we hadnt clarified whether it had been taken into account that Miss Ms current account and 
a loan were both in joint names, so not liable for the whole debt.
The matter has been referred to me for further consideration. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have to consider whether 118 118 Money completed reasonable and proportionate checks 
to satisfy itself that Miss M would be able to repay the loans in a sustainable way and/or 
without experiencing significant adverse consequences. Then taking that into account I have 
to consider whether in the circumstances 118 118 Money made a fair lending decision.
For each loan, 118 118 Money carried out a credit check and verified Miss Ms income 
through a third party. It also required Miss M to complete an application giving details of her 
monthly income and expenditure.
In respect of loan one, this showed that Miss M had two credit cards, both of which were 
very close to the limit, and had in recent months been over limit. The credit check for loan 
two showed she hadnt been able to pay off anything from either credit card.
118 118 Money carried out affordability assessments for loans one and two. These showed 
that Miss M had considerably underdeclared the amounts she paid on unsecured loans and 
credit cards and had declared £0 other outgoings such as utility bills etc. 118 118 Money 
assessed these outgoings at £425 on both applications. 
Ive reviewed Miss Ms bank statements for the periods up to and including the third loan. 
This showed a pattern of Miss M being increasingly unable to meet her repayments and of 
taking out a number of loans (including a large joint loan) to repay old loans. Her bank 
account was considerably overdrawn (by over 50% of the limit). And while I appreciate that 
that account was in joint names Miss M would have still been liable for at least half of the 
current account debt and taking that into account along with the other credit she had, I think 
118 118 Money should have been concerned. The statements also showed that rather than 
earning £1,700 per month as Miss M had declared and as 118 118 Money had assessed, 
she was earning around £1,200 per month.
In light of what the credit checks and Ms Ms bank statements show about her financial 
circumstances and taking into account that she had considerably underdeclared her 
outgoings, I think it showed serious concerns about her ability to sustain the borrowing and 
should have prompted 118 118 Money to carry out further checks to verify Miss Ms ability to 
repay any loan. For those reasons I dont think 118 118 Money made a fair lending decision 
in respect of loans one and two.
In respect of the third loan, I wont go into this further, as 118 118 Money has accepted our 
adjudicators view that this was unaffordable. 
Putting things right
118 118 Money should:
Add up the total amount of money Miss M received as a result of being given loans 1, 2 
and 3. 
Deduct all repayments Miss M made from this amount. 
If reworking Miss Ms loan accounts results in her having effectively made payments 
above the original capital borrowed, then 118 118 Money should refund these 
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the date 
the overpayments would have arisen, to the date of settlement. 
If reworking Miss Ms loan accounts results in there being an outstanding capital balance 
118 118 Money should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Miss M. 
Remove any adverse information recorded on Miss Ms credit file in relation to loans 1,2 
and 3.  
As 118 118 Money sold the outstanding debt on loan 3 to a third-party it should do what 
it can to buy it back - if it cant, it cant deduct any outstanding balance from the redress and it then it needs to work with the third-party to bring about the steps above.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money to 
take off tax from this interest. It must give Miss M a certificate showing how much tax its 
taken off if she asks for one.
My final decision
I uphold the complaint and require Madison CF UK Limited trading as 118 118 Money to 
provide the remedy set out under Putting things right above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 21 February 2022.
