The complaint
Mr K has complained about Hoyl Independent Advisers Ltd. He says that Hoyl delayed 
in following his instructions to crystallise his pension so he could take tax free cash 
(TFC).
What happened
The background to this complaint has been set out in detail by the investigator and I will only 
summarise it here.
Mr K had made it known to his advisers, Hoyl that he wished to take his 25 per cent TFC 
from this pension fund when the value reached £159,000. Although Hoyl wasnt monitoring 
the fund value on a daily basis, there was a point where that value was reached but Mr K 
decided to wait until the value reached £160,000. 
In late November 2019 the value reached £160,000, and Mr K confirmed that he wanted to 
take his TFC. This request was noted in an internal email of 27 November 2019. Mr K says 
that he understood this process was under way but on 6 December he contacted Hoyl as he 
had heard nothing further. He was told that a signed suitability report would be needed to 
action his request. On 9 December 2019 Mr K was told the find value had fallen to £159,653 
and the 25 per cent TFC would be £39,913. He decided to go ahead and take his TFC.
Mr K complained about his losses. Hoyl didnt uphold the complaint and it was referred to 
this service.
An investigator considered the complaint and decided that it should be upheld. He felt that 
Mr K had lost the opportunity of receiving higher TFC. He said that Hoyl knew he wanted to 
take TFC when the fund reached a certain value and so it could have worked on a suitability 
report sooner if that was necessary. He also noted that Hoyls internal communications 
suggested it could have acted on a written instruction from Mr K, which it had.
The investigator said that Hoyl should compensate Mr K by paying him the difference 
between the TFC he would have received based on the fund value on 28 November 2019 
and the TFC he actually received. He said that interest should be added at 8 per cent simple 
to reflect the loss of use of the money.
The fund value on 28 November 2019 was £161,318.16 so potentially providing TFC of 
£40,329.54. He actually received TFC of £39,885.57. 
So, the loss was £443.97 (£40,329.54 - £39,885.57). 
Hoyl didnt agree. It said that Mr K had suffered no loss. Since crystallisation the fund has 
grown by 2.7 per cent therefore the £443.97 not drawn now has a value within the fund of 
£456.00, so he is £12.03 better off and has not lost the money as it is still there. It added that 
if he wished to withdraw the £456.00 it would underwrite any tax payable on this amount less 
the £12.03 growth.
The investigator restated his view and said: 
In September 2019 Mr K said he wished to crystallise his pension fund upon reaching
£160,000. 
On 27 November 2019 he confirmed his request.
On 28 November the fund value was £161,318.16. 
However, the crystallisation wasn't completed until 9 December 2019 but by that
time the value had fallen to £159,542.28. As a result. Mr K received less tax-free 
cash.
Hoyl didnt agree and so the case has been referred to me for a final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive summarised what has been said in this complaint, but Ive read everything. I agree with 
the adjudicator and with his reasoning. I uphold this complaint.
Whilst Hoyle were not under any obligation to monitor the value of Mr Ks pension fund, it 
seems that it was well aware of his wishes for some time before November 2019. If it was 
necessary to prepare a report on the suitability of his choices, I think this could have been 
addressed sooner. So, I dont think this ought to have caused any delay in crystallising the 
TFC. And its own internal communications suggest it could have acted on a written 
instruction from Mt K which it did have.
Its clear that the value of the fund fell between 28 November and 9 December 2019. I think 
the lower value did cause Mr K a loss. I disagree with Hoyls logic. Once Mr K took his TFC 
he effectively crystallised 25 per cent of his investment at that value. Any subsequent 
fluctuations in the value of the remaining 75 per cent of the fund that was still invested dont 
impact on the 25 per cent that was sold. I can agree that if Mr K hadnt taken his TFC and 
left 100 per cent of the fund intact, he may not have suffered any losses if the fund had 
grown in value. But he effectively did crystallise a loss when he took his TFC.
If Mr K had taken the TFC earlier, as he wished, he would have been selling assets from his 
pension at what was a good time, the value was high. If he were now to withdraw cash from 
the remaining fund that would not replace the money he had lost, it would just be a 
withdrawal from the remaining 75 per cent of the pension fund assets.
I dont agree with Hoyls logic. Im satisfied that there has been a loss to Mr K and the loss is 
the difference between the TFC he could have received and the TFC value he did receive. I 
agree this is £443.97.
Putting things right
Hoyl must pay Mr K £443.97 plus interest calculated at 8 per cent per year simple from 28 
November 2019 to the date of payment.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint about Hoyl Independent Advisers Ltd. It must pay redress as set out 
above.Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision before 23 December 2020.
