K820x#14complaint
Mr Ks complaint is about the compensation National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) has 
offered to settle  his complaint about a mis-sold  payment  protection insurance (PPI) policy 
taken out with a loan.
background
Mr K complained to NatWest that he may have been  mis-sold PPI related to the overdraft on 
his current account  and also in association with some loans. 
NatWest said it could  find no PPI was ever associated with his overdraft. With regard to  
loans ending  4290 and 5568  it said these formed a chain with loan 4290 taken out in 
July 1991 and loan 5568 refinancing it a month  later in August 1991. NatWest  said no PPI 
was sold with loan 4290 but PPI was sold with loan 5568 and it upheld Mr Ks complaint this 
PPI was mis-sold.
NatWest offered compensation of £770.00  to settle  Mr Ks complaint  about the mis-sold PPI. 
Mr K said this wasnt the correct amount as it only included a refund of 22 monthly payments 
of the PPI premiums,  rather  than 24 months  that the loan covered and the PPI wouldve 
been paid.
Our adjudicator initially said they thought what the business had offered was fair. However 
following further discussion, the business reviewed its offer and said it would refund 23 
monthly premiums rather than the 22 it had offered. 
Mr K was still unhappy as he still considers 24 premiums should be refunded  and he has 
asked for an ombudsman to look at his complaint.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mr K has raised concerns about  PPI sold with a number of financial products taken out 
through NatWest.  But in this decision I am only considering  his complaint about possible 
mis-sold PPI with his overdraft and loans ending 4290 and 5568.  Any other PPI complaints 
related to other loans are being dealt with separately.
In relation to Mr Ks current account  overdraft NatWest has been unable  to identify that any 
PPI was ever sold in relation to this. Without  any clear evidence  to show PPI was ever 
attached to Mr Ks overdraft then no further consideration of this can be made  by NatWest 
and I can make no finding about PPI on the overdraft.
Mr K applied for loan 4290 in July 1991,  but it was settled  less than a month later in 
August 1991 when  Mr K took out loan 5568.  Mr K didnt take out a PPI policy  with loan 4290  
but he did take out PPI with loan 5568 paid for by a monthly premium. Loan 5568  was to be 
repaid over 24 months and the PPI was intended to run for the same  length of time.
NatWest has limited  data available for the period in 1991 when the loans and PPI were 
taken out. A copy of the loan agreement, which included the PPI application, has been  
provided although some of this is difficult to read. The records  of NatWest show  the start 
Ref: DRN85975642date of loan 5568 as 6 August  1991  and it is known  it ran for the full term of 24 months  to 
August 1993.
There are some bank statements available from 1993 and these show the last 9 months  of 
the loan repayment and also payment of the PPI monthly premiums. The last PPI premium is 
shown as taken  from the current  account  on 21 June  1993, the last loan repayment being 
made on 6 August 1993. 
So although  there is evidence to show when  the PPI payments ended, there is nothing to 
show the early payments  of the PPI monthly premiums in 1991.
Loan 5568 was taken  out on 6 August 1991  and was due to run for 24 months. The PPI to 
cover this loan was likely to have started on the same date, not before as there  would have 
been no debt repayment for the PPI to cover before this date.
The loan amount borrowed was paid to Mr K on 6 August 1991 and his first loan repayment 
was due to be made  on 6 September 1991.  The PPI would have started at the same time as 
the loan and on the later available statements it is shown the PPI premium was paid on or 
around 25th of the month. So it is most likely  the first payment for the PPI was taken on or 
around 25 August  1991, just after the loan amount was paid to Mr K but before the first 
repayment of the loan was due. 
I know Mr K has said that the loan agreement was signed in July 1991 and he would have 
made the first PPI payment in July 1991.  But Ive seen nothing  to show  that a PPI payment 
was made  in July 1991. It is also possible that Mr K may be confusing the first loan he 
applied for, in July 1991 with the second loan that was taken out in August 1991. With his 
first loan application here was no PPI policy taken.
The bank statements show that the loan ran to its full term and was repaid by the final 
repayment made on 6 August 1993. But the statements also show no PPI premium  was paid 
after the one taken on 21 June 1993. Therefore  based on the evidence Ive seen,  I think it 
most likely Mr K paid a maximum of 23 monthly premiums for the PPI policy. Why the last 
premium due in July 1993 was not paid is unclear, but the evidence shows  this wasnt  paid 
by Mr K.
NatWest has now offered to repay 23 monthly  premium payments, which is a total of 
£296.01. In addition it is paying compensatory  interest of 15% simple until April 1993 and 8% 
simple after this date,  for any time Mr K has been  out of pocket for the PPI costs.
In total its latest  offer comes to £813.84 after tax. NatWest is required to deduct  tax by HM 
Revenue and Customs  on any compensatory interest paid.
I understand Mr K feels he should get 24 months of PPI premiums refunded as when he took 
it out it was intended to run for that number of months. But I cannot see that a premium was 
paid before loan 5568  started in August  1991.  And the statements show  that no premium 
was paid in July 1993, which should have been the last premium.  So based on the evidence 
I have seen, I think that what NatWest is now offering  in compensation, to refund 23 PPI 
premiums, is fair.
Ref: DRN85975643my final decision
For the reasons  Ive set out above  I think that a refund of 23 PPI premiums,  plus 15% and 
8% simple  interest as appropriate for dates before and after April 1993,  is fair compensation 
for National Westminster Bank  PLC to pay to Mr K to settle his complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 29 May 2019.
