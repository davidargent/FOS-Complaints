DRN-2755704
The complaint
Ms B complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has refused to refund a purchase that 
was not delivered under their Buyer Protection Scheme.  
What happened
Ms B purchased an item online through PayPal for £27.05. She says she didnt receive the 
item so she contacted PayPal to raise a item not received claim. If the claim was 
successful then the original payment Ms B made wouldve been refunded. PayPal contacted 
the seller of the item who provided them with proof of shipping from an overseas shipping 
company and a tracking number for a UK based postal service.
PayPal did not uphold Ms Bs claim as they said the item was delivered to her postal 
address. They said that she could appeal this decision if she provided a letter from the postal 
service confirming that the item was delivered to a different address.
Ms B brought her complaint to our service. Our investigator upheld her complaint based on 
the tracking information provided by the postal service as well as PayPals Buyer Protection 
Scheme. The investigator said the tracking information from the postal service didnt include 
Ms Bs address, neither did it include Ms Bs postcode, county or a country. When 
comparing this with PayPals requirements under its Buyer Protection Scheme, it says that 
satisfactory proof of delivery requires at least country, city/state and postcode details, so 
our investigator didnt think PayPal acted in line with its own Buyer Protection Scheme. 
PayPal asked for the complaint to be referred to an Ombudsman. They said the item showed 
as being at her nearest post office and so she could have collected it. They said they had no 
proof that this did not happen and advised Ms B could appeal their decision with a letter from 
the postal service confirming she hasnt received the item.
 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I have looked carefully at the tracking information provided by the delivery company and 
PayPals Buyer Protection Scheme. I can see that the tracking information from the postal 
service shows none of Ms Bs address. This is an important part of why Ms B should be 
covered under the scheme and Ill explain why.
Ive looked at PayPals requirements under their Buyer Protection Scheme. This says the 
proof of delivery document requires an address for the recipient showing at least the 
city/state, city/country, or zip/postal code. So, Im not persuaded that PayPal has acted in 
line with its own Buyer Protection Scheme as none of Ms Bs address was showing on the 
proof of delivery document. 
While I accept PayPal arent responsible for the postal services actions, Im satisfied that Ms 
B ought to have been covered under PayPals Buyer Protection scheme in the 
circumstances here. 
Ive thought about what PayPal have said about how Ms B could have collected the parcel 
from her local delivery office. And that she would need to get a letter from the postal service 
to confirm she hadnt received the item. But, this doesnt alter how PayPal havent followed 
their own Buyer Protection scheme. I say this as there is no mention in the scheme rules for 
Ms B to need to obtain a letter from the postal service when the seller hasnt met the proof of 
delivery requirements. And in this instance, for the reasons already given, the seller didnt 
meet PayPals definition of the proof of delivery. So it follows that Ill be asking PayPal to put 
things right and refund Ms B the cost of the item she purchased.
Putting things right
Our investigator has suggested that PayPal pay Ms B £27.05 to refund the cost of the item 
which I think is fair in the circumstances. 
My final decision
I uphold the complaint. PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should pay Ms B £27.05.  
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 2 June 2021.
