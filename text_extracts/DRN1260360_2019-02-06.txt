K821x#15complaint
Ms M complains that MEM Consumer Finance Limited (trading as Payday UK) gave her 
loans that she couldnt afford to repay.
background
Ms M took out a total of seven loans with Payday  UK between April 2008 and July 2009. She 
was unable to repay  loan 4, 5 and 7 in line with her original agreements. And it took her 
nearly three  years to finish repaying the final loan.

Ms M says the loans were unaffordable for her. She says she was struggling to pay bills, and 
ended up in a cycle of debt. She says she had to take out loans  again  and again to keep 
afloat. 
Our adjudicator recommended  that the complaint should be upheld in part. In summary,  he 
thought that Payday UK should have carried out more thorough affordability checks from 
loan 2 onwards.  He didnt have enough  evidence  to show  that Payday UK should have 
concluded that loans 2 and 3 were unaffordable  for Ms M. But he thought  that the fact that 
Ms M repeatedly deferred repayment of loan 4 should have highlighted  to Payday UK that 
she was likely to be having difficulty repaying the loan.  And he commented that when Ms M 
deferred loan 4 for the fourth time,  it meant that the total interest on the loan exceeded the 
amount shed borrowed. 
The adjudicator thought  that when Ms M asked to defer loan 4 for a fourth  time,  Payday UK 
should have contacted Ms M to discuss any problems she was having, and to give her a 
chance to pay the loans  back  sustainably.  And he said its failure to do so added  to her 
financial strain. So he said that Payday UK should  refund all interest  and charges Ms M paid 
from the fourth deferral  onwards on loans 4, 5 and 7, with interest on the refund, and remove 
any negative information caused by those  deferrals from Ms Ms credit  file.
Payday UK offered  to do as the adjudicator had recommended. But Ms M isnt happy with 
Payday UKs offer. Shes reiterated that she was having to borrow repeatedly  in order to get 
by and wasnt able to keep up with essential bills. She says she had to see a debt counsellor 
and set up a payment plan. As Ms M didnt accept  Payday UKs offer,  the complaints been 
passed to me.
Ref: DRN12603602my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Ive also taken into account the law, any 
relevant regulatory  rules  and good industry  practice  at the time the loans were  offered.
Payday UK was required to lend responsibly. It needed to make  checks  to see whether 
Ms M could afford to pay back each loan before it lent to her. Those checks  needed to be 
proportionate to the amount Ms M was borrowing, but there was no set list of checks  it had 
to do.
Before lending, Payday UK asked for details of Ms Ms income. I think  that for all but the first 
loan, it should  have looked  more  carefully  into Ms Ms financial situation to check that she 
could afford  to repay the loans. But I cant be sure what  it would have  found  out if it had done  
so. We asked Ms M to provide us with copies of her bank  statements from around the time 
that she was borrowing  from Payday UK, so that we could see what  its likely that it would 
have discovered  if it had carried out more  detailed checks. But she hasnt been able to 
provide them. I dont think thats surprising,  given the time thats passed. But it does mean 
that I havent been able to get a detailed picture  of Ms Ms financial circumstances at the 
time.
I dont think that Payday  UK was wrong  to give Ms M the first loan. And based on what Ive 
seen, I cant safely conclude that she couldnt afford to repay the remaining loans. But I think  
that the repeated rollovers on loans 4, 5 and 7 should have caused some  concern to 
Payday UK as to whether Ms M was experiencing financial problems. Without more 
evidence, I cant be sure what  further checks would have shown Payday. But its accepted  
that it shouldnt  have allowed Ms M to continue rolling over the loans. And its offered to 
refund all interest and charges Ms M paid from the fourth deferral onwards on those loans, 
with interest on the refund. Its also offered to remove the deferrals  from Ms Ms credit file. 
Based on the evidence  available to me, I cant fairly  require it to do more.
my final decision
My decision  is that MEM  Consumer Finance Limited (trading as Payday UK) should  do as it 
has offered to do, by refunding the interest and charges Ms M paid from the fourth deferral 
onwards on loans 4, 5 and 7 respectively, with interest, as offered, on the refund and by 
removing the deferrals from Ms Ms credit file.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 March 2019.
