Ms V complained that ECI did not perform  adequate credit  checks;  if it had done, it would 
have seen she was relying on short term loans and could not sustain her loan repayments.
Our adjudicator partially upheld Ms Vs complaint and thought the loans from 6 onwards 
shouldnt have been given and that the credit  file should be amended to reflect this. 
ECI disagreed with our adjudicators view and made  a further offer only to uphold  Ms Vs 
complaint from 10 onwards and that it would  remove loan 11 onwards from her credit file. 
This was because ECI said its creditworthiness and affordability assessments were  robust  
and proportionate for loans 1 to 9. 
Ms V  through  her representative  rejected ECIs new offer saying ECI only upheld  12 
loans, whereas our adjudicator upheld 17 loans  and so the complaint was passed to me to 
look at again.
Ms V didnt make any comments about  loans 1-5 which were  rejected as our adjudicator 
thought these loans had not been  made irresponsibly. So I will not be looking at those loans 
Ref: DRN25086402in this decision but I have kept these loans in mind  when  thinking about Ms Vs overall 
lending relationship. I will be looking in more detail at loans 6 to 22.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Having done that, I am going  to uphold this complaint from loan 6 onwards. I will explain my 
reasons below.
ECI needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Ms V could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that ECI should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable  and that point was also reached in 
Ms Vs case.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that ECI was required to establish whether 
Ms V could sustainably repay her loans   not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ref: DRN25086403Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Ms Vs complaint.
Ive looked at the overall pattern of ECIs lending history with Ms V, with a view to seeing  if 
there was a point  at which ECI should  reasonably  have seen that further lending was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so ECI should have  realised that it shouldnt have 
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Ms Vs case, I think  that this point was reached by loan 
6. I say this because:
At this point ECI ought to have realised Ms V was not managing to repay all the loans 
sustainably. Ms V had taken out 6 loans  within 7 months. So ECI ought  to have 
realised it was more likely  than not Ms V was having to borrow  further to cover the 
hole repaying  her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that Ms Vs 
indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Ms V wasnt using the loans as intended. Many ran for only a month or so  
compared to the intended loan term.
Ms Vs first loan was for £150  and loan 6 was for £250. At this point ECI ought to 
have known that Ms V was not likely  borrowing to meet a temporary shortfall in her 
income but to meet an ongoing  need. 
Ms V wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed ECI. Loan 22 was 
taken out just 18 months after loan 6. Ms V had paid large  amounts  of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to ECI over an extended  period.
I think that Ms V lost out because ECI continued  to provide borrowing from loan 6 onwards  
because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Ms Vs indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Ms V borrowed was likely to 
have had negative  implications on Ms Vs ability to access mainstream credit and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 6 to 22 and ECI should put things right.
putting things right  what Elevate Credit  International  Limited needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Ms V paid on loans 6 to 22 (inclusive);
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
Ref: DRN25086404the number  of loans taken from 6 onwards means any information  recorded about 
them is adverse.  So all entries about  loans  6 to 22 (inclusive)  should be removed 
from Ms Vs credit file.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Elevate Credit International  Limited to take off tax from 
this interest. Elevate  Credit International Limited must give Ms V a certificate showing how 
much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Ms Vs complaint.  Elevate Credit 
International Limited should put things right for Ms V as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Ms V to accept or 
reject my decision  before 28 February  2020.
