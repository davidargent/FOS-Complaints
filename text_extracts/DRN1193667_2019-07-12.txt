background
This complaint is about 10 payday  loans  QuickQuid provided to Miss S between 
August 2012 and December 2013.  Miss S lending history is as follows:

Miss S topped  up loan 5 and theres an outstanding balance on loan 10. When  Miss S 
complained to QuickQuid,  it said it thought it lent most of the loans responsibly but that it 
shouldnt have lent loan 5, it offered to refund the interest and charges Miss S paid towards 
this loan plus interest. But Miss S didnt accept its offer.
One of our adjudicator upheld Miss S complaint and thought the loans from December 2012 
(loan 4) onwards shouldnt have been  given. QuickQuid disagreed and the complaint was 
passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
QuickQuid needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly.  In 
practice this means  that it should have  carried out proportionate checks to make sure Miss S 
could repay  the loans  in a sustainable manner.  These checks werent prescriptive  and could 
take into account a number  of different things, such as how much  was being lent, the 
repayment amounts  and the consumers income  and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the 
early stages of a lending relationship, I think less thorough  checks  might be reasonable and 
proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that QuickQuid should fairly  and reasonably have 
done more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These factors  
include:
Ref: DRN11936672the lower a customers income  (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make 
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that QuickQuid was required to establish 
whether QuickQuid could  sustainably  repay her loans  not just whether the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the Consumer  Credit Sourcebook (CONC) defines sustainable 
as being without undue difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to 
make repayments on time,  while meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without 
having to borrow  to meet the repayments (my emphasis) . The Office  of Fair Trading (OFT)  
guidance also defined  sustainable in much  the same way as being without undue  difficulties  
 in particular  without incurring or increasing problem indebtedness,  over the life of the credit 
agreement, out of income and/or savings  and without having to realise security or assets.  
And it follows that a lender should  realise,  or it ought fairly and reasonably to realise, that a 
borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably if theyre unlikely to be able to 
make their repayments without borrowing further.  
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss S complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, he didnt think loans  1 to 3 were wrongly lent. Miss S hasnt  
disagreed with this finding  or raised  any new points. And so as there isnt a continuing 
dispute about these loans, I havent  gone into details about them here. Also,  QuickQuid has 
made an offer in line with what this service recommends  on loan 5 and so I wont be going  
into the details  of this loan either. My decision will focus on loan 4 and loans  6 to 10 as they 
remain in dispute.  
In its file submission and response  to the adjudication, QuickQuid raised a number of points, 
most of which the adjudicator has addressed and I agree  with. The adjudicator explained 
why he didnt think the break in lending between loans 5 and 6 was sufficient and his opinion 
to partly uphold Miss S complaint was based on QuickQuid repeatedly lending to her and 
not on a strict pounds  and pence calculation.
QuickQuid provided  a copy of its lending criteria from March 2015.  This isnt a new point and 
something that this service has addressed  in several final decisions in the past.  This point 
from QuickQuid is generic and doesnt focus on the issues in Miss S case. So these 
arguments by QuickQuid havent changed  my mind.
Ref: DRN11936673Our adjudicator thought the repayment  of loan 4 was due to take up a significant  portion of 
Miss S income. I can see that she was due to repay  around  £1,050  from an income  of 
£1,633. This repayment was substantial and I think it was likely that Miss S would have 
struggled to sustainably repay this loan. I think QuickQuid ought  to have realised this and not 
lent to her.
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of QuickQuids lending  history with Miss S to see if 
there was a point  at which QuickQuid should  reasonably have seen that further lending  was 
unsustainable, or otherwise harmful. And so QuickQuid should have realised that it shouldnt 
have provided  any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss S case, I think that this point was reached by 
loan 6. I say this because by loan 6, Miss S had been borrowing significant sums  from 
QuickQuid on a regular  basis without any noticeable  breaks. I agree with the adjudicator that 
the break between  loans  5 and 6 wasnt sufficient for QuickQuid to reasonably believe 
Miss S financial circumstances had improved.  Particularly because  shed struggled to repay 
loan 5 and rolled it over twice after topping up the borrowing. Also when Miss S requested 
loan 6, it was more than any of her previous loans and QuickQuid ought to have realised that 
it was likely the previous  loan repayment  had left a hole in her finances which she needed to 
borrow again to fill.
Also, from loan 6 onwards Miss S was provided  with a new loan within  days  of settling a 
previous one. So QuickQuid shouldve been concerned that it was more likely than not 
Miss S indebtedness was increasing unsustainably.
Miss S in my opinion wasnt making any real inroads  to the amount she owed QuickQuid. 
Loan 10 was taken out around 34 months after Miss S first. And it was for a larger amount, 
more than double  the amount of loan 1. Miss S had paid large amounts of interest to, in 
effect, service a debt to QuickQuid over an extended period.
I think that Miss S lost out because  QuickQuid continued to provide borrowing from loan 6 
onwards and:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Miss S indebtedness by allowing her 
to take expensive credit intended  for short-term  use over an extended  period of time. 
Miss S was borrowing from QuickQuid for nearly three years.
the sheer number  of loans was likely to have had negative  implications on Miss S 
ability to access mainstream credit and so kept her in the market for these high-cost 
loans.
So Im upholding  the complaint about  loans 4 and loans 6 to 10 and QuickQuid  should  put 
things right for those  loans as well as loan 5.
putting things right  what QuickQuid  needs to do
refund  all interest and charges Miss S paid on loans 4 to 9;
pay interest of 8% simple  a year on any refunded interest  and charges from the date 
they were paid (if they were) to the date of settlement;
remove any negative information  about loans 4 and 5/5a from Miss S credit file;
Ref: DRN11936674the number  of loans taken from loan 6 onwards means any information  recorded 
about them  is adverse. So all entries  about  loans 6 to 10 should be removed from 
Miss S credit file.
I understand that there is an outstanding balance on loan 10, QuickQuid  should  
remove any interest and charges added to this loan. It should also treat any 
payments Miss S has made  as payments towards the capital. If theres still a balance  
outstanding, it may offset the capital  balance from the redress  above.  QuickQuid  may 
only offset any outstanding capital balance  if it still owns  the debt.
 HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid 
must give Miss S a certificate showing how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Miss S complaint.  
CashEuroNet UK LLC should  pay Miss S compensation as set out above.  
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss S to accept 
or reject my decision before 12 August 2019.
