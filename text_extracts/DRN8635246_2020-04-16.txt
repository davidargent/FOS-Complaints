Miss M complains that Elevate Credit  International Limited (trading as Sunny)  lent 
irresponsibly to her. 
background 
Between June  2017 and September 2018, Miss M borrowed 12 loans from Sunny. Her 
borrowing history is set out in full at the appendix to this decision. I understand that there is 
an outstanding  balance on loans 10 to 12. 
Our adjudicator thought the complaint should  be upheld in respect of loans 4 to 12. She 
thought that proportionate checks would have shown Sunny that Miss Ms loan repayments 
were not sustainably affordable from loan 4. And by loan 7, she thought the pattern of 
borrowing was otherwise harmful. 
Sunny didnt agree with that view. However, it offered to write off the outstanding balance  in 
respect of loans 10 to 12. Miss M didnt agree with that view.  Another of our adjudicators  
looked at the matter.  He said that Sunny shouldnt have agreed to loans 3 to 12. He thought 
it should have  been clear  Miss M couldnt  sustainably repay loans 3 to 9 and that the pattern 
of borrowing  was otherwise harmful in respect  of loans 10 to 12. 
Neither party responded to our adjudicators latest  view and so the matter  has been  passed 
to me to make a final decision.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Miss M could  
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers  income  (reflecting that it could be more  difficult to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult  to meet a 
higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number  and frequency of loans,  and the longer the period of time during 
which a customer  has been  given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing  
may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, unsustainable).
Ref: DRN86352462There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Miss M could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  the loan payments 
were affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation.  
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Miss Ms complaint.
I agree  with our second adjudicator that due to the length of time between  loans  1 and 2, Miss Ms 
borrowing constitutes two chains of lending. So Ive looked at loan 1 and loans 2 to 12 separately.  
Loan 1
As I said above, early  in the lending relationship, I think it was reasonable for Sunny  to rely 
on the information Miss M provided  to it and that which it had obtained of its own volition. I 
can see that Sunny did some form of credit check and it established that Miss M was not 
insolvent. It also asked  about her income and expenditure. At this stage, Miss Ms 
repayment constituted just under 25% of her declared income. I think  Sunny did just about 
enough in respect  of this loan to show the repayments were  sustainably affordable. 
Loans 2 to 12 
As I said above, this was a separate chain of lending, so loan 2 was the first loan of the new 
chain. In respect of loan 2, I can see again that Sunny asked Miss M about her income  and 
expenditure. And from the information  she provided,  I think the repayments would have 
appeared sustainably affordable. 
However, by loan 3, I agree with our second  adjudicator that Sunny should have done more.  
When Miss M applied for loan 3, loan 2 was still outstanding. So her monthly  repayment  for 
both loans would have been in the region of £350  per month. I think this was a significant  
proportion of her declared monthly earnings  of £1,350.  At this point, Sunny should have 
undertaken more  checks. I think a proportionate check  at this stage would have constituted a 
full review of Miss Ms circumstances.  
Had that review been undertaken, I think Sunny would have seen that Miss M was indebted 
to a number of short-term  lenders. In January alone, she had made  repayments  of over 
£1,407 towards  this type of borrowing. Miss M was also spending considerable sums on 
online gambling sites.  Put simply,  a proportionate check would have clearly  demonstrated  to 
Sunny that Miss M could  not sustainably afford to repay her loans  from loan 3 onwards. 
Ref: DRN86352463Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of the lending history with a view to seeing if there was 
a point at which Sunny should reasonably have seen that further  lending  was unsustainable, 
or otherwise harmful. If that was the case,  Sunny should have realised  that it shouldnt  have  
provided any further loans. 
Given the particular  circumstances of Miss Ms case, I agree with our second adjudicator  
that this point was reached by loan 10. I say this because:
At this point Sunny  ought to have realised Miss M was not managing to repay her loans 
sustainably. She had taken out 9 loans within around 5 months. So Sunny ought  to have 
realised it was most likely Miss M was having  to borrow further  to cover the hole 
repaying her previous  loan was leaving in her finances and that Miss Ms indebtedness 
was increasing unsustainably.
Miss Ms first loan in this chain was for £800 and loan 10 was for £1,000. At this point 
Sunny ought to have known that Miss M was not likely  borrowing to meet  a temporary 
shortfall in her income but to meet  an ongoing  need. 
Miss M wasnt making any real inroads to the amount  she owed. Loan 12 was taken out 
nine months after the first loan in this chain.  Looking at the outstanding loans at that 
time, Miss M owed  more. She had paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service a 
debt to Sunny over an extended period.
I think that Miss M lost out because Sunny continued to provide borrowing from loan 10 
onwards because:
these loans  had the effect of unfairly  prolonging her indebtedness by allowing her to 
take expensive  credit intended for short-term use over an extended period;
the number of loans  she borrowed was likely  to have  had negative implications on her ability  
to access mainstream credit and so kept him/her in the market for these high-cost loans.
So Im also upholding  the complaint about loans 2 to 9 and loans 10 to 12. Sunny will need 
to take action to put things right.
putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
Sunny shouldnt have given Miss M loans 3 to 12. 
I understand there is an outstanding balance  on loans 10 to 12. If Sunny has sold the 
outstanding debts, it must buy these back if it is able to do so and then take the following  
steps. If it cannot buy the debts back, then it must  liaise  with the new debt owner to achieve 
the results outlined below. 
a)Sunny must add together the total of the repayments made by Miss M towards  interest, 
fees and charges  on all upheld  loans  without an outstanding  balance,  not including  
anything already refunded.
b)Sunny must calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Miss M 
which were considered as part of paragraph (a), calculated from the date Miss M 
originally made the payments, to the date the complaint  is settled. 
Ref: DRN86352464c)Sunny must remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance  on any upheld 
outstanding loans, and treat any repayments made by Miss M as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. If this results  in Miss M having 
made overpayments then Sunny must refund  these  overpayments  with 8% simple  
interest* calculated  on the overpayments,  from the date the overpayments  would have 
arisen, to the date the complaint is settled. It should then refund the amounts calculated  
in A and B and move to step paragraph  (e). 
d)If there  is still an outstanding  balance then the amounts calculated in (a) and (b) should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on the outstanding loans If this results in a 
surplus, then the surplus should be paid to Miss M. However  if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny must should  try to agree an affordable  repayment  plan.  
It shouldnt pursue outstanding balances made  up of principal  it has already written-off. 
e)Sunny should remove any adverse information recorded on Miss Ms credit file in 
relation to loans  3 to 9. 
f)The overall pattern  of Miss Ms borrowing  from loans 10 to 12 means any information  
recorded about them is adverse, so Sunny should remove  these loans entirely from her 
credit file. It does not have to remove loans 10 to 12 from the credit file until they have 
been repaid, but it must still remove any adverse information about them.   
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. It should give 
Miss M a certificate showing  how much  tax has been deducted,  if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partly  upholding Miss Ms complaint. Elevate Credit 
International Limit must  put things right as set out above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 16 May 2020.
