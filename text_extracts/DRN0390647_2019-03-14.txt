K820x#14complaint
Mr R says The Royal Bank  of Scotland Plc (RBS) mis-sold him a payment  protection  
insurance (PPI)  policy.  
background
Mr R bought the policy in 1997 at the same  time as taking out a credit card. 
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Mr R disagreed with the adjudicators opinion, 
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Mr Rs case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Mr Rs complaint because:
 I think RBS made Mr R aware that he had a choice about  buying the PPI, and that he 
chose to take it. This is because he ticked a box on his credit  card application to 
indicate he wanted PPI. 
 RBS didnt recommend the PPI to Mr R so it didnt have to check if it was right for him. 
 Its possible the information RBS gave Mr R about the PPI wasnt as clear as it 
shouldve been. But Mr R doesnt appear  to have been affected by any of the main 
things the policy  didnt cover  and based on what I know about  his circumstances it 
looks like the policy couldve been  useful to him. He says he wasnt entitled  to any sick 
or redundancy pay, and didnt  have any other  way to make repayments if he couldnt 
work. So I dont think better  information wouldve stopped him buying it. 
Ive taken into account Mr Rs comments.  But these points dont change my conclusion. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, I dont uphold Mr Rs complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 14 April 2019.
