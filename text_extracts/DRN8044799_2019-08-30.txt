K821x#15complaint
Mr Ps unhappy with the way PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has treated some purchases  
he made.
 
background
In September  2018 Mr P bought a mobile  phone costing just over £539 using PayPal credit.  
Hes unhappy that PayPal credit was set as his default payment method and that this 
transaction, and some  new ones, have led to him building  up a debt and incur late payment 
fees and interest.  He says hes contacted PayPal many times  asking for PayPal credit to be 
removed as his default payment option but this hasnt happened. 
Our investigator felt this complaint  should  be upheld. She said:
The PayPal user agreement says if Mr Ps bank  account details arent linked to his 
account PayPal  credit will be his default  payment method.  And this supersedes  using 
his debit card. But she can understand why he believed  hed set up his debit card for 
payments. All this couldve been explained  more clearly to Mr P when he emailed 
asking for help. If it had been Mr P wouldve been better informed about how to 
prevent his transactions defaulting  to PayPal credit. 
Mr P made it clear  to PayPal he didnt want PayPal credit as his default payment 
method and he sent multiple emails between  23 March  and 3 May 2019. But PayPal 
didnt resolve the issue and gave  unclear responses. This upset and frustrated Mr P 
and he should  be paid £100  for this.
The late payment fees and interest  were applied  correctly  to Mr Ps account in line 
with the Pre Contract information. It isnt reasonable to ask PayPal  to write off the 
debt as Mr P has received  his purchases  and had use of them.  PayPals offer to 
refund £9.03 interest applied to his account  and set up a repayment plan over four 
months for the remaining  balance  is fair as it means he is only paying  off the overall  
balance for the purchases he made.
Mr Ps credit  file should accurately reflect his payment history.  Here  he missed  some 
payments and this will be reflected  on his credit history. 
PayPal doesnt  agree. It says Mr P was given the opportunity to change  the funding  source 
at any time. It was up to him to do so. He agreed  to the funding  arrangement  used when he 
set up his account. And he has been  told how to choose a different funding source but didnt 
do so. It hasnt acted outside its user agreement.  It tried calling him but his number had been 
removed from the PayPal system. Its offer of a four month payment plan and a refund of 
some interest is a goodwill gesture. Its been fair and reasonable and doesnt agree to pay 
£100 compensation.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN80447992I agree  with the investigators conclusions for the same reasons.
I think PayPal couldve dealt with Mr P better at times. In particular it couldve been clearer in 
responding to his multiple emails. If it had I think its likely matters  couldve been resolved at 
an earlier stage as Mr P wouldve better  understood his position and how to register  his 
preferred payment method.
I agree  with the investigator that this wouldve caused Mr P some distress and 
inconvenience which warrants  an award  of some compensation. Taking everything into 
account, including the level of awards we make, I think a payment of £100  is fair and 
reasonable for this. But if Mr P still owes PayPal money I think its fair and reasonable for it 
to apply this amount towards any outstanding balance failing which it should pay it, or part of 
it, to Mr P directly.
I also think PayPal acted  reasonably by agreeing to refund £9.03 of interest and I 
understand that amount  has already been  debited from his account.  So, I simply leave it to 
Mr P to decide, if he hasnt already done so and if the payment offer remains open,  if he 
wants to pay off any outstanding balance over a four month period.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  To put things  right PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA should  pay Mr P 
£100 compensation as set out above.
 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision  before 30 September  2019.
