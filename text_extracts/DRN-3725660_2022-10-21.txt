The complaint
Mr P complains that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA failed to properly refund all the disputed 
transactions that occurred on his account.
What happened
Mr P suffered fraud on his PayPal account, resulting in numerous transactions being made 
against it. Mr Ps account was linked to an account at another bank  Ill refer to them as J. 
When Mr Ps PayPal account was used to make the payment, it took the funds from his 
account with J.
Mr P notified both PayPal and J about the fraudulent payments and it was agreed that he 
was due a full refund. Mr P received various refunds back to his account with J, including 
from PayPal.
PayPals systems registered that one of the disputed transactions had been refunded twice 
to Mr P because J had also refunded one of the payments. This duplicated the refund, 
resulting in a debit on Mr Ps PayPal account. Mr P was then required to make a payment to 
his PayPal account, even though he denied receiving the second refund. 
Mr P made the payment to settle his PayPal account, but continued to deny hed ever 
received two refunds for one of the disputed transactions. When he complained to PayPal 
about this, they declined to refund the payment hed made. Mr P then brought his complaint 
to the Financial Ombudsman Service for an independent review.
It was looked into by one of our adjudicators who examined the records supplied by both Mr 
P and PayPal. Mr P sent in various copies of his statements showing that hed never 
received the second refund.
PayPal provided details of the various refunds theyd made to Mr Ps account and showed 
the second refund being made back to Mr Ps bank (J). This second payment was as a result 
of a Chargeback procedure which both PayPal and J had been involved in. 
Our adjudicator thought that the evidence showed Mr P had never received the payment 
despite PayPal showing it was sent back to J. Mr Ps complaint was upheld. PayPal 
disagreed and asked for a further review, believing theyd made the payment to Mr P and it 
was more a matter for J to resolve.
Mr Ps complaint has now been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Theres no disagreement between the parties about what happened to Mr P concerning the 
disputed transactions. PayPal accepted that Mr P had been the victim of fraud and refunded 
them. J also accepted that Mr P had been the victim of fraud.
What appears to be the issue here is that both PayPal and J were involved in the refund 
process and at some point, an overlap occurred which generated two refunds for the same 
transaction. Mr P wasnt entitled to a duplicate refund and PayPal believed theyd sent the 
second payment to him after a Chargeback had been processed by J.
PayPals records indicate that they sent the payment to J, as opposed to Mr P. Mr Ps 
records, which match those supplied by J, show that he didnt receive any payment into is 
account as a result of the Chargeback. In fact, his annual statement doesnt show any 
activity on the account at all.
So, whilst I appreciate PayPal believe they made a second refund to Mr P, the evidence 
doesnt support that. It appears that the issue is between PayPal and J, rather than with Mr 
P. But here, hes been the one required to make up the payment to PayPal.
PayPal believe its more a matter for J to resolve. But here, Mr P has made a complaint 
about PayPal, who are the ones who requested Mr P pay funds into his account after 
PayPals actions to remove the second refund. In effect, PayPal took a payment from Mr P, 
resulting in him being in a worse position than before the disputed transactions took place. I 
appreciate PayPal believed their evidence showed theyd made a payment to Mr P, but it 
only shows a payment was made to J.
Putting things right
The fair and reasonable resolution here is for PayPal to refund Mr P the disputed transaction 
with interest at 8% for the loss of the use of those funds from the time the payment was 
taken, to the time its repaid. Its for PayPal to then take up the issue of the missing payment 
with J.  
If PayPal considers that it is required by HM Revenue & Customs to withhold income tax 
from that interest, it should tell Mr P how much its taken off. It should also give Mr P a tax 
deduction certificate if he asks for one, so he can reclaim the tax from HM Revenue & 
Customs if appropriate.
My final decision
My final decision is that I uphold this complaint against PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA. 
Theyre required to settle this complaint as Ive outlined above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 18 November 2022.
