K821x#15complaint
Mr B complains that British Gas Insurance Limited  is responsible for poor service in 
connection with his home emergency insurance policy.
background
The Financial Ombudsman  Service deals with consumer complaints about  regulated  
activities and ancillary activities  carried out by insurance companies and other  regulated 
financial firms.
Where I refer to British Gas I refer to the insurance  company of that name  and I include its 
associated plumbing  and drainage company and others insofar as I hold that insurance  
company responsible for their actions.
Mr B has an upstairs flat. He called  British Gas for help with a leak of water into the flat 
below. In June  2018 British Gas said someone had installed his toilet  poorly  so the policy  
didnt cover the repair. British Gas replaced  the pipework as a chargeable repair  for £136.00. 
But there was still a leak.
After three or four further visits, Mr B complained that there  was still a leak.  He engaged a 
third party to fix the issue. The third party completed the job and invoiced Mr Bs wife 
£2,376.00 including VAT.
In January 2019 British Gas sent Mr B a cheque. It was for £576.00  towards the third partys 
invoice and an extra £50.00, a total of £626.00.
In a final response dated 15 February 2019 British Gas said it was sending Mr B a cheque  
for a further £60.00.
Unhappy with that response, Mr B brought  his complaint to us in March 2019. He 
complained that British  Gas should  refund the £136.00 for work that was not required. He 
also complained  that British Gas had only reimbursed part of the third partys invoice and 
declined to give details  of its figure.
British Gas submitted  that part of the complaint  wasnt within  our jurisdiction. In November 
2019, our investigator  decided that the complaint  was within our jurisdiction. In February 
2020, British Gas agreed that the complaint  falls within our jurisdiction.
On 13 February 2020, British Gas said the following:
confirm that we should make good the access made to repair the pipework, this 
doesnt include redecoration costs.
our investigators opinion
Our investigator recommended that the complaint should be upheld  in part. He didnt 
recommend that British  Gas should refund the £136.00. He said that the third party had 
broken down its invoice as follows:
Trace and access £456.00
Repairs £576.00
Reinstatement £528.00
Ref: DRN59198482Sub-total          £1,560.00
Redecoration £816.00
 Total          £2,376.00
The investigator thought that  apart from the redecoration costs  the policy covered the 
above costs. He recommended that British  Gas should:
1.reimburse Mr B the third party costs he incurred less the redecoration costs. This is a 
total of £1,560.00 which works out as £984.00 on top of the £576.00 Mr B has 
already been offered.
2.pay Mr B an additional  £100.00  on top of the £60.00 he has already been  offered for 
the distress and inconvenience  caused.
my provisional decision
After considering all the evidence,  I issued a provisional decision on this complaint to Mr B 
and to British  Gas on 21 April 2020.  I summarise my findings:
Mr B and British Gas are now agreed  that  in relation to the third partys  invoice  it 
should refund him not just £576.00  but a further  £984.00, a total of £1,560.00.
Mr B or his wife have  been out of pocket since about  15 October 2018. But I consider 
that he couldve paid in the British  Gas cheque dated about 9 January 2019.  So I find 
it fair and reasonable to direct  British Gas to pay interest at our usual rate on the 
balance of £984.00.
£200.00 is fair and reasonable compensation for distress and inconvenience.  
Subject to any further information from Mr B or from British Gas,  my provisional  decision was 
that I was minded to uphold this complaint in part. I intended to direct  British Gas Insurance  
Limited to pay Mr B the following sums  insofar as it hasnt already paid him:
1.£1,560.00  for the third partys  invoice; and
2.simple interest on £984.00  at a yearly rate of 8% from 15 October 2018 to the date of 
payment. If British Gas considers that HM Revenue and Customs requires it to 
withhold income tax from that interest,  it must tell Mr B how much  its taken off. It 
should also give him a tax deduction certificate  if he asks for one, so he can reclaim 
the tax from HM Revenue  & Customs if appropriate ; and
3.£200.00 for distress  and inconvenience.
Mr B accepts the provisional  decision. He asks for British Gas to provide a cheque  or 
transfer for the full amount as the previous  uncashed cheques have expired. 
British Gas has not responded to the provisional  decision.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ref: DRN59198483Pipes are often covered by surfaces such as walls and floors. The British Gas policy  covered 
making access through such surfaces  with the agreement of the policyholder.  The policy 
covered repairing pipes and making good  but not replacing  finishes such  as tiles or 
decoration. Making  access and making  good  were together subject to a financial limit of 
£1,000.00.
The policy didnt cover repairs to pipes or systems that hadnt been  correctly installed.
Mr B accepted the investigators opinion. I think he now accepts that British Gas correctly 
told him that his toilet hadnt been correctly  piped  and needed to be re-piped. So I dont find 
it fair to direct British  Gas to refund its charge of £136.00.
After that re-piping,  there  was still a leak. But British Gas said that this was a second and 
separate leak. It replaced an air admittance valve on 15 June. I think  that would be to allow  
air into the toilet waste pipe.
After that there was still a leak. And British Gas visited again in July 2018. 
In about October  2018 Mr B engaged the third party. The third partys report  described the 
job as complicated. It involved making access from the flat below to fix a leaking hot water 
pipe.
I can understand Mr Bs frustration. But I havent seen enough technical evidence to show  
that British Gas should reasonably have  found  and fixed that leak  with or without access  
from the flat below.
Mr B and British Gas are now agreed  that  in relation to the third partys  invoice  it should 
refund him not just £576.00 but a further £984.00, a total of £1,560.00.
Mr B or his wife have  been out of pocket since about  15 October 2018. But I consider that he 
couldve paid in the British Gas cheque  dated  about  9 January 2019. So I find it fair and 
reasonable to direct  British Gas to pay interest at our usual rate on the balance  of £984.00.
I dont think that  until recently  - British Gas dealt fairly with Mr Bs claim  for reimbursement 
of the third partys invoice.  I dont doubt that this caused him some  extra  distress  and 
inconvenience at an already difficult time for him. 
Some of this distress and inconvenience is to do with being out of pocket  for which  interest 
is compensation. I consider that, in addition, £200.00 is fair and reasonable compensation 
for distress and inconvenience.  
British Gas has sent a cheque  for £576.00  plus £50.00 (total  £626.00) and a further cheque 
for £60.00. It has offered  to cancel and re-issue those cheques. 
Overall Im minded to find it fair and reasonable to direct British Gas to pay Mr B the 
following sums insofar as it hasnt  already  paid him:
1.£1,560.00  for the third partys  invoice; and
2.simple interest on £984.00  as set out below;  and
Ref: DRN591984843.£200.00 for distress  and inconvenience.
my final decision
For the reasons  Ive explained, my final decision is that I uphold this complaint in part. I 
direct British Gas Insurance Limited to pay Mr B the following sums insofar as it hasnt 
already paid him:
1.£1,560.00  for the third partys  invoice; and
2.simple interest on £984.00  at a yearly rate of 8% from 15 October 2018 to the date of 
payment. If British Gas considers that HM Revenue and Customs requires it to 
withhold income tax from that interest,  it must tell Mr B how much  its taken off. It 
should also give him a tax deduction certificate  if he asks for one, so he can reclaim 
the tax from HM Revenue  & Customs if appropriate ; and
3.£200.00 for distress  and inconvenience.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 June  2020.
