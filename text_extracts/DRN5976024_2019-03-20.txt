K821x#15complaint
Mr H complains that CashEuroNet  UK LLC lent to him irresponsibly. CashEuroNet  UK LLC 
approved loans to Mr H under both its trading names of Pounds to Pocket and as QuickQuid 
so I will refer to it as CashEuroNet.

Using the information from CashEuroNet our adjudicator has created a table of approved

Loan 1 was an instalment loan with 12 monthly repayments. The other loans  were  for a 
shorter period. These usually were structured as multiple payments  over two or three 
months where the last repayment was larger than the earlier repayments. Mr H made  two 
repayments for Loan 5 but the rest remains  outstanding.
Mr H complained to CashEuroNet in August 2018  and complied  with its request to send to it 
bank statements for the period during which he had taken his loans. CashEuroNet  did not 
uphold his complaint. Mr H responded by explaining  that due to pay day lenders and short  
term loans he had got into a spiral of debt. He explained that he had 
been  juggling different lenders to pay each other. This should  have  been  evident 
when credit checks where done.  I was also late on many payment with other lenders 
again this should have  been evident  in your checks. This has resulted  in me 
escalating in further and further debts.
Our adjudicator considered the complaint and she thought that CashEuroNet  ought  to put 
things right for Mr H in relation to Loans 4 and 5. 
CashEuroNet has said that it cannot  agree with the adjudicators views on the loans funded  
after March  2015 . It referred back to its earlier  submissions (received by this service in 
October 2018) where it says that it provided detailed information indicating  why the loans 
were responsibly lent. 
These earlier submissions included its 13 page  CashEuroNet Lending Process  2015 
document and a table showing its own calculations of what  it considers  to have been Mr Hs 
estimated disposable income  (EDI) for the loans.  
It said:
Ref: DRN59760242since 1st March 2015, QuickQuid implemented affordability review, which involved 
collecting and validating  income and expense details from customers, in line with the 
FCA Handbook. As such, we believe Mr [Hs] loans issued  post 2015  were 
affordable. For these reasons, I cant agree that CashEuroNet UK irresponsibly lent to Mr [H]. 
there were  a number  of measures implemented when assessing Mr [Hs] overall  
creditworthiness to ensure he was not vulnerable at the point lending  was made. As 
a result,  the loans were approved using the information provided  during his 
application as he satisfied our lending criteria at the time.
Mr H had nothing to add and did not send  us any other points to take into consideration 
before it was passed to me. So it seems  Mr H is satisfied  with the adjudicators  opinion  and 
therefore has no issue in relation to Loans 1 to 3. So I do not plan to reassess those three  
loans. Therefore I will be focussing on Loans  4 and 5 which  remain  unresolved. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  I have also taken into account the law, 
any relevant regulatory  rules and good  industry practice at the time.
The FCA was the regulator at the time Mr H borrowed the loans in question (Loans 4 and 5). 
Bearing in mind the rules and guidance  set out in its Principles for Business (PRIN) and its 
Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC), I would expect a lenders affordability assessment to 
vary with circumstance. (I am not quoting the specific regulations  here because, as before, 
I would expect CashEuroNet to be conversant with these through  previous ombudsman  
decisions, particularly  recent decisions, which set these out in detail.) 
In general, Id expect  a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender  to seek more assurance by carrying out more  detailed checks:
-the higher  the loan amount,
-the lower the consumers income;  or
-the longer  the lending relationship.
Loan 4 (the third payday loan) was the second  loan in this loan chain which  commenced  
July 2017. CashEuroNet already had information  on Mr Hs declared  income  of £2,600  plus 
his declared expenses and regular financial commitments of £850. The third repayment on 
Loan 4 was going to be high relative to Mr Hs declared income  just under  £700. So it 
seems proportionate checks ought  to have included looking to see what other high-cost 
short-term (HCST) loans Mr H had outstanding at the time he applied  for Loan 4. 
CashEuroNet has demonstrated  to us its own calculation of Mr Hs EDI by obtaining what  it 
terms the CRA Validated other credit commitments figure and then calculating  the EDI 
from that. It concluded Mr Hs EDI for Loan  4 was just under £557. We have not received the 
credit bureau search results which have given CashEuroNet this CRA validated credit  
commitment figure and so it is not clear as to the basis  for this calculation.
 
Mr Hs declared  expenditure of £850  included what he considered were his monthly credit 
commitments and he gave a figure of £150  for that category. His other monthly expenses 
Ref: DRN59760243figure (as declared) appears to have been  £700 (£850 - £150 = £700).  And if the 
CashEuroNet CRA validated figure of £1,620 is combined with Mr Hs declared expenditure 
(net of his own given  figure for credit) then this comes  to £2,320. When  this is subtracted  
from Mr Hs declared  income of £2,600 it seems Mr H would  have been  left with about  £280 
with which  to repay Loan 4. The largest repayment due was more  than this sum of about 
£700. 
So it seems  that using CashEuroNets CRA Validated figure  plus Mr Hs declared 
expenditure figure (net of his declared credit figure to be fair to CashEuroNet) would come to 
a combined expenditure figure  which would  leave him with only £280. And this is clearly a lot 
less than the highest repayment figure for Loan  4. So I do not consider the CashEuroNet  
calculations and explanations enough  to persuade me that it has carried out the appropriate  
and proportionate checks at this stage  to comply with the creditworthiness  assessment.
Even if CashEuroNet  disagrees  with my points, we have looked at Mr Hs personal credit file 
and seen that his outstanding other HCST loan commitments alone added  up to sums of 
£1,351 being due to be paid out that month.  These  were five instalment loans with five 
different HCST lenders  with the combined  monthly repayment due to be £1,351. This means 
that Mr H was in a position where  he was committed to repaying 51% of his net salary to 
other lenders at the time he applied for Loan  4. And CashEuroNets CRA validated  figure  
would have been 62% of Mr Hs net salary. 
And having so much  other  debt,  if CashEuroNet had done the checks I consider would have 
been proportionate at the time then I think it would have realised the level of his 
indebtedness overall. I think its likely its lending decision would have differed to the one it 
did make.  I uphold Mr Hs complaint for Loan  4.
Loan 5 I can deal with more succinctly. Mr H struggled to repay Loan 4. I can see from the 
email correspondence  between the parties  that a repayment arrangement  was set up around 
6 February 2018  to assist him. Mr H applied to CashEuroNets other loan provider (Pounds 
to Pocket) for an instalment loan which was declined on or about 13 February  2018.  And yet 
CashEuroNet went on to approve Loan  5 for Mr H a few days later.  And I note that the 
application for Loan 5 was the day after he had repaid Loan  4. 
These details arise from CashEuroNets own records  and it was the third significant multipay 
loan (several repayments) in eight months.  And I think  that these factors combined would 
have presented a picture of someone who may well have had an underlying reason for this 
persistent application for HCST loans. And whether CashEuroNets own calculation of EDI 
led it to make the lending  decision  or not, the creditworthiness  check cannot have been 
satisfactorily carried out for a man in these circumstances. I uphold Mr Hs complaint about 
Loan 5.  
As if to underline  the fact that Mr H was not able to afford Loan 5, he was not able even to 
make the first instalment - a default  notice was sent to him on 29 March 2018  and still he 
continued to apply to CashEuroNets other provider (Pounds to Pocket) twice more   in April 
and May 2018.  Both applications were  declined. 
On or about 22 June  2018 Mr H agreed  a repayment plan for Loan 5. Some is outstanding. 
Ref: DRN59760244what CashEuroNet should do to put things right
CashEuroNet should:
refund  the interest and charges Mr H paid on loans 4 and 5
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when they were  paid until the 
date of settlement*
remove any adverse information  about  loans 4 and 5 from Mr Hs credit history.
As there is an outstanding balance on Loan  5, then CashEuroNet  should  remove  all 
outstanding interest  and charges and fees from it, treat all payments made by Mr H to date 
as if they were reduction of the principal  sum,  and any surplus is to be repaid to Mr H. 
If theres no refund left over but an outstanding  balance remains,  then an attempt should be 
made to come to a mutually agreeable repayment plan in order  to repay the outstanding 
balance. Or the redress due to Mr H can be used to off-set the outstanding Loan 5 balance. 
*HM Revenue & Customs  requires CashEuroNet to take off tax from this interest. It must 
give Mr H a certificate showing  how much  tax its taken off if he asks for one. Any off-set is to 
be done after the tax has been deducted. 
my final decision
My final decision is that I uphold Mr Hs complaint in part and I direct that 
CashEuroNet UK LLC does as I have outlined above. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision  before 20 April 2019.
