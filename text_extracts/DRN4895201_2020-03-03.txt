K821x#15complaint
Mrs K says Elevate Credit International Limited,  trading as Sunny (Sunny) irresponsibly 
lent to her. Mrs K said the borrowing repayments meant she struggled to maintain her day to 
day expenditure and had to borrow more to repay her debt. 
background
This complaint is about one running  credit facility followed  by 47 short-term  loans Sunny 
provided to Mrs K between October  2014 and September 2017. Mrs Ks borrowing history  is 
attached as an appendix to this decision.  
Before the complaint came to this service  Sunny had already offered to uphold Mrs Ks 
complaint about  the running  credit  facility. 
One of our adjudicators partially upheld  Mrs Ks complaint and thought the loans from loan 
ten onwards shouldnt have been  given. Sunny disagreed but did offer to uphold  the 
complaint for loans  33 onwards. We passed on the offer to Mrs K but didnt hear back.
Another of our adjudicators looked again at the complaint and thought that the loans from 
loan five onwards  shouldnt  have  been given. By this time Mrs K had been borrowing  from 
Sunny for a long period of time and the amount borrowed had increased again. 
Neither party responded to the adjudicator. As the complaint remains  unresolved it has been 
passed to me to decide in my role as ombudsman.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending - including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice - on our website. 
Sunny needed  to take reasonable steps  to ensure that it didnt lend irresponsibly. In practice 
this means that it should have carried out proportionate checks  to make  sure Mrs K could 
repay the loans  in a sustainable manner. These checks could take into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being  lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. With this in mind,  in the early stages of a lending 
relationship, I think less thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate.  
Ref: DRN48952012But certain factors might  point to the fact that Sunny  should fairly and reasonably  have done 
more to establish that any lending was sustainable for the consumer. These  factors include:
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could  be more difficult to make  
any loan repayments  to a given loan amount  from a lower  level of income);
the higher  the amount  due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater  the number  and frequency of loans, and the longer  the period of time 
during which  a customer has been  given  loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).
There may even come  a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable.
I think that it is important for me to start by saying that Sunny was required to establish 
whether Mrs K could  sustainably repay  her loans  not just whether the loan payments were  
affordable on a strict pounds and pence calculation. 
Of course the loan payments being  affordable  on this basis  might be an indication a 
consumer could sustainably make their repayments. But it doesnt automatically follow this is 
the case. This is because the relevant regulations define sustainable as being without undue 
difficulties and in particular the customer should  be able to make  repayments on time,  while  
meeting other reasonable commitments;  as well as without having to borrow  to meet  
the repayments. And it follows that a lender should  realise, or it ought fairly and reasonably 
to realise, that a borrower wont be able to make their repayments sustainably  if theyre  
unlikely to be able to make their repayments without borrowing further. 
Mrs K didnt comment on the adjudicators opinions that loans two to four shouldnt  be 
upheld and Sunny  had already offered to pay redress for the running credit facility   the first 
borrowing. Because of this, I dont think there  is any ongoing disagreement  about  loans one 
to four. So, I wont be making a decision about this lending.  But the running credit facility  and 
loans were part of the borrowing relationship Mrs K had with Sunny. So, it is something I will 
take into account when considering the other loans she took. 
Ive carefully considered  all of the arguments, evidence  and information  provided in this 
context and what this all means for Mrs Ks complaint.
As our adjudicator explained, a proportionate  check for loan five would most likely  have 
shown that Mrs K:
was having  problems managing her finances. Sunny should have sought to build a 
picture of Mrs Ks financial position. If it had done  so it would have  seen that Mrs K 
was borrowing from other short-term credit providers at the same time as she was 
borrowing from Sunny  which significantly increased her monthly repayments. 
Ref: DRN48952013Mrs K had taken loan three on the same  day that loan two had been repaid. She then 
repaid loans three and four on the same  day and borrowed again ten days  later and 
with the increased  amount of £250, a larger sum than the £100 borrowed at loan 
four. Quick repeat borrowing can be symptomatic of someone juggling their finances, 
which is part of Mrs Ks complaint,  that she struggled with day to day living  costs 
because of the borrowing. 
I also note that Mrs K repaid some of her loans early, again  a behaviour  which can 
be an indication of someone juggling their finances and using one loan to repay 
another, thereby remaining in debt for longer and incurring high levels  of cost. 
Ive also looked  at the overall pattern of Sunnys lending history with Mrs K, with a view to 
seeing if there was a point at which Sunny should reasonably  have seen that further lending 
was unsustainable,  or otherwise harmful. And so Sunny should have realised that it 
shouldnt have provided any further loans.  
Given the particular  circumstances of Mrs Ks case, I think  that this point  was reached by 
loan ten. I say this because:
At this point Sunny ought to have realised Mrs K was not managing  to repay  her 
loans sustainably. Mrs K had been  indebted to Sunny  for 14 months. So Sunny ought  
to have realised it was more likely than not Mrs K was having to borrow  further to 
cover the hole repaying her previous loan was leaving in her finances and that 
Mrs Ks indebtedness was increasing  unsustainably.
Mrs Ks first loan  after the running  credit   was for £50 and loan ten was for £200.  
And while I appreciate  the amounts borrowed did fluctuate, I think at this point Sunny 
ought to have known that Mrs K was not likely borrowing to meet  a temporary  
shortfall in their income but to meet  an ongoing need. 
From  loan ten onwards Mrs K mostly had overlapping loans where loans with Sunny 
were running concurrently, in some cases was taking several loans a month and was 
provided with a new loan within days or weeks of settling a previous one. 
Mrs K wasnt making any real inroads to the amount she owed Sunny. Loan 47 was 
taken out 30 months after Mrs Ks first. And it was for a larger  amount. Mrs K had 
paid large amounts  of interest  to, in effect, service  a debt to Sunny over an extended 
period.
I think that Mrs K lost out because Sunny continued  to provide borrowing from loan ten 
onwards because:
these loans had the effect of unfairly prolonging Mrs Ks indebtedness by allowing 
her to take expensive  credit intended for short-term  use over an extended period of 
time.
the number  of loans and the length of time over which Mrs K borrowed was likely  to 
have had negative  implications on Mrs Ks ability to access  mainstream  credit  and so 
kept her in the market for these  high-cost loans.
So, like the adjudicator, Im also upholding the complaint about loans from loan five onwards 
and Sunny should put things right.
Ref: DRN48952014putting things right  what Sunny needs  to do
If the outstanding balances  due on Mrs Ks loans have been  transferred to a third party  
Sunny should  buy the loans back if it can. If Sunny  cant buy the loans  back  than it needs to 
work with the third party to make sure the following is achieved: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs K towards interest,  fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance.
B) Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs K which were 
considered as part of A, calculated  from the date Mrs K originally  made the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges  from the balance on any upheld  outstanding 
loans, and treat any repayments made  by Mrs K as though they had been 
repayments of the principal on all outstanding loans. 
If this results  in Mrs K having made  overpayments  then Sunny should refund  these  
overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the overpayments, from the 
date the overpayments would have arisen,  to the date the complaint is settled. 
Sunny should  then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move  to step 
E.
D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated  in A and B 
should be used  to repay  any balance remaining on outstanding loans. If this results in 
a surplus, then the surplus  should  be paid to Mrs K. However, if there is still an 
outstanding balance then Sunny should try to agree an affordable  repayment plan 
with Mrs K. 
E) Remove any adverse information  recorded on Mrs Ks credit  file in relation to loans 
five to nine. The number of loans taken  from loan ten onwards means any 
information recorded about them is adverse. So, all entries about loan ten onwards 
should be removed  from Mrs Ks credit file.
Sunny doesnt have to remove any of the outstanding loans from Mrs Ks credit file 
until these have  been repaid, but Sunny should  still remove  any adverse information 
recorded about these loans. 
 HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mrs K a certificate  showing how much tax its taken off if she asks for one.
Ref: DRN48952015my final decision
For the reasons  given  above, Im partially  upholding Mrs Ks complaint. Elevate Credit  
International Limited should put things right as set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs K to accept or 
reject my decision  before 3 April 2020.
