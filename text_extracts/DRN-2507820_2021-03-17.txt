The complaint
Mr H complains National Westminster Bank Plc didnt treat him fairly when he told it he was 
in financial difficulties. He is also unhappy with some of the ways it administered his credit 
card account.
What happened
Mr H had a credit card account with NatWest. The account terms set out the payments that 
NatWest expected Mr H to make and the charges that could be applied to the account.
In May 2018, Mr H wrote to NatWest to let it know he was in financial difficulty. NatWest 
wrote back asking Mr H to complete an income and expenditure form. The letter also stated 
that the account would be put on hold for 30 days but interest would continue to charged in 
line with the terms and conditions of the account.
Mr H completed and returned the income and expenditure and set up monthly repayments.
The account defaulted in August 2018 and the debt was sold in September 2018. 
Mr H is unhappy that NatWest continued to charge interest on his balance after hed notified 
it he was in financial difficulty. He was charged £134.63 on his June 2018 statement and 
£133.70 on his July 2018 statement. Mr H said in line with the Consumer Credit sourcebook 
(CONC) regulations NatWest shouldve treated him with forbearance from the time he 
notified them he was in financial difficulty and asked for the interest to be refunded.
NatWest said the interest charges were applied fairly and in line with the terms of the
account. 
Mr H also raised administration issues regarding not receiving a response in relation to 
queries hed made and NatWest not properly allocating a monthly repayment of £46. 
NatWest offered him two separate payments (each of £50) by way of cheque for these 
issues which Mr H says were sent to his previous address in error. 
The investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. The investigator felt that whilst it 
was open to NatWest to suspend the interest on the account it didnt have to do this. What it 
had to do was treat Mr H positively and sympathetically once it knew he was in financial 
difficulty. She felt that what NatWest did was a positive and sympathetic response. She also 
felt the compensation NatWest paid for its acknowledged administration errors was fair. She 
noted the cheques were sent to an incorrect address but she felt it was Mr Hs responsibility 
to make sure the address for his account was correct.
Mr H disagreed. He felt that whilst it might not be a stated requirement of CONC that a bank 
should stop charging interest immediately it was also the case that there is no other obvious 
way of offering financial forbearance. He also said that there was no difference in him telling 
NatWest that he was in difficulty to him filling in an income and expenditure form other than 
the bank trusting that what he was saying was true. Regarding his address and the posting 
of the two compensation cheques to the wrong address he said NatWest made it very clear 
when it handed his account over that he should not communicate directly with NatWest, but 
should instead deal only with the debt collectors. He says he did this and told the debt 
collectors  of his new address. In addition, his complaint letter- which NatWest responded to 
- had his new address on.
The investigator issued a second view. She still felt that NatWest had acted in line with the 
CONC rules. She said she didnt expect the debt collectors to update the bank of Mr Hs 
change of address as these are two separate businesses. She also felt that a bank might 
require proof of a change of address before changing it on its system.
Mr H disagreed. He points out that NatWest had a letter with his new address on it and as 
they chose to respond to it so it was their responsibility to ensure that communications it sent 
go to the correct person. He also points out that one of NatWests email responses had an 
attachment and on that attachment there was a blank space where his address was 
supposed to be. So he had no opportunity to correct it. He says the crux of his argument is 
that since he advised NatWest's appointed agent of his new address and since he 
complained directly to that third party and since NatWest chose, of its own accord to 
respond, it is its responsibility to ensure that its communications go to the up to date contact 
details which will, necessarily lie with its agents. The post going to the wrong house was 
particularly bad because it was received by his former partner who Mr H says is abusive.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As the investigator has explained when a bank is told that a consumer is in financial difficulty 
it has a responsibility to act positively and sympathetically. There are a range of things it can 
do to meet this obligation. In this case the bank: 
put the account on hold which meant, amongst other things, late fees should not be 
charged although interest still would be
requested further information regarding income and expenditure
defaulted the account within a reasonable period of receiving that information and 
thus stopped any further charges or interest accruing
agreed a repayment plan.
In my view that was a positive and sympathetic response and so NatWest has met its 
obligations and I wont be asking it to do anything more. The fact that it could have done 
things differently doesnt mean that what it has done wasnt sufficient.
I also agree with the investigator that the compensation paid by NatWest was a fair response 
to its acknowledged errors.
It is unfortunate that the letters enclosing the cheques werent sent to Mr Hs new address 
particularly given the nature of his relationship with the occupant of his former home. But 
again, I agree with the investigator that it was Mr Hs responsibility to inform NatWest of his 
new address. Writing a letter from a different address does not, in and of itself, inform the 
reader that the person has moved permanently. And the fact that the organisation that 
bought his debt from NatWest was aware of the new address doesnt mean that Mr H should 
have assumed NatWest would have the address. It was his responsibility to inform NatWest. 
Given the nature of his relationship with the occupant of his former address I would have 
thought it would have been wise for Mr H to make certain that NatWest had his correct 
address. I cant hold NatWest responsible for him not telling it directly.
My final decisionI do not uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr H to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 April 2021.
