The complaint
Mr A complains that National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) wanted to charge additional 
interest in respect of a COVID payment deferral period agreed when theyd previously told 
him they wouldnt.
What happened
Mr A contacted NatWest in April 2020. He told them his income had been negatively 
impacted by the global pandemic and asked what support was available to help him as he 
may struggle to meet his loan repayments. NatWest agreed to a defer Mr As loan 
repayments for April, May and June 2020. They said theyd write to him 14 days before 
expiry of the deferral to explain his options. NatWest also confirmed that no additional 
interest would be applied to Mr As loan in respect of the deferred payments.
In July 2020, Mr A contacted NatWest again. They explained he could either repay the 
missed payments or his loan could be extended by three months. The extension would 
require him to sign an amendment to the existing loan agreement. Mr A confirmed he 
wanted to extend the loan by three months.
When Mr A received the new paperwork, NatWest had added additional interest onto his 
loan. He didnt think this was right as NatWest had assured him there would be no additional 
interest costs. So, Mr A complained to NatWest about this.
NatWest didnt agree they done anything wrong. They said that although they wouldnt 
charge additional interest for the payments deferred, they would charge additional interest 
on the balance he owed as this would now be being borrowed for three months more. Mr A 
didnt agree with NatWests findings. So, he referred his complaint to this service.
One of our adjudicators investigated Mr As complaint. She didnt think NatWest had acted 
fairly and thought they hadnt provided adequate information to enable Mr A to understand 
the implications of the payment deferral. Our adjudicator thought NatWest should refund all 
interest applied to the loan for the three-month deferral and also pay compensation to Mr A 
of £100.
NatWest agreed with our investigators findings and resolution, but Mr A didnt agree. He 
raised several other complaint points and suggested that NatWest should pay compensation 
to him of £2,000.
As an agreement couldnt be reached, Mr As complaint has been passed to me to reach a 
final decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
In his responses to our adjudicators view, Mr A has referenced other complaint matters. 
These werent specifically considered by NatWest as part of this complaint. I understand 
these have been raised and considered separately. So, for clarity, the complaint Ive 
considered relates only to the payment deferral agreed and the interest NatWest proposed 
to add, as a result.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued guidance to lenders on 2 April 2020 which 
explained what they expected from businesses during the exceptional circumstances arising 
out of the global pandemic. Their guidance asked businesses to consider payment deferrals 
of up to three months under regulated credit agreements. 
The FCA said their guidance applied where consumers were already experiencing or 
reasonably expect to experience temporary payment difficulties as a result of the pandemic. 
The FCA also said that firms should ensure that there is no negative impact on the 
consumers credit file because of the payment deferral.
The FCA said firms would be entitled to charge a reasonable rate of interest where a 
customer requests a temporary payment freeze. In the event that a customer requires full 
forbearance that interest should be waived.
Ive listened to a recording of Mr As original conversation with NatWest in April 2020. 
NatWest said, Well make sure theres no interest accrued because of the build up of the 
arrears. They also said, At the end of those three months, we would then look to either 
resume at your normal payments with an extension of your loan past the maturity date; or 
you can choose to clear those arrears over one to 18 months. NatWest confirmed they 
wouldnt change the interest rate so youd still pay the same amount, just the loan would 
continue three months past. During the call, Mr A told NatWest his main worry was he didnt 
want to pay any more interest. NatWest reassured him, You wont pay additional interest 
because well refund the interest thats accrued over these three months.
The FCAs guidance makes it clear that NatWest were entitled to charge interest for the 
period of the payment deferral. But, I think NatWests comments meant Mr A was entitled to 
conclude that the payment deferral wouldnt result in any additional cost to him. 
The FCAs guidance also made it clear that NatWest needed to fully explain their agreement 
to Mr A so that he fully understood its implications. Ive found nothing to suggest NatWest 
told Mr A there would be any additional costs as a result of the deferral. Our adjudicator 
asked NatWest to provide copies of any letters sent to Mr A confirming the deferral 
agreement. But NatWest havent been able to do that.
I dont believe it was fair of NatWest to add additional interest once Mr As payment deferral 
ended. They shouldve told him that at the outset as this may have influenced Mr As 
decision to accept their offer. So, I think NatWest should put this right. I will also be asking 
them to compensate Mr A for the distress and inconvenience he suffered as a result of their 
mistake.
Our adjudicator Suggested NatWest should pay Mr A £100. Compensation is a personal 
thing. What is seen as reasonable by one party may not be considered so by another. Mr A 
did experience some inconvenience. But I think the amount offered feels fair in all the 
circumstances here. I appreciate that Mr A doesnt agree. But it isnt the role of this service 
to make awards in order to penalise NatWest for their mistakes. Any award is considered 
based upon the impact NatWests mistake had upon Mr A. And I think NatWests offer does 
that here.My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I uphold Mr As complaint.
I require National Westminster Bank Plc to:
refund any additional interest calculated and charged to Mr As personal loan that 
resulted from the payment deferral agreed; and
ensure that the balances reported on Mr As credit file reflect these refunds; and
pay compensation to Mr A of £100.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr A to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 April 2022.
