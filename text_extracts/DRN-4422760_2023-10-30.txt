The complaint
Mr M complains that Clydesdale Financial Services Limited, trading as Barclays Partner 
Finance, has rejected the claims that hes made to it for a refund of the money that he paid 
for a holiday ownership product. Hes being represented in his complaint by a claims 
management company.
What happened
I issued a provisional decision on this complaint last month in which I described what had 
happened as follows:
Mr M and his wife entered into a purchase agreement to buy some holiday 
ownership products in October 2010. The purchase price was £30,750 and Mr M also 
entered into a fixed sum loan agreement with Barclays Partner Finance for a loan to 
pay for part of the purchase price. Barclays Partner Finance says that Mr Ms loan 
was settled in full in September 2012.
Mr Ms representative, on behalf of Mr M, made claims to Barclays Partner Finance 
in January 2021 under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Ive 
seen no evidence to show that Barclays Partner Finance responded to those claims 
and a complaint was then made to this service.
Mr Ms complaint form says that: Barclays Partner Finance paid a commission to the 
holiday company which wasnt declared to Mr M; the holiday company failed to 
conduct a proper assessment of Mr Ms ability to afford the loan, unduly pressured 
him into entering the contracts and used aggressive commercial practices to 
pressure him; the product was misrepresented to him; and the holiday company was 
in liquidation so was in breach of contract as it cant provide the goods or service sold 
to Mr M; all rendering the agreement unfair pursuant to section 140. It said that the 
claim should also be considered under section 75. Barclays Partner Finance then 
said that, as the purchase price was over £30,000, Mr M was unable to make a claim 
under section 75.
Our investigator didnt recommend that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld. He 
thought that Barclays Partner Finance was entitled to rely on the timing of Mr Ms 
section 140A claim to turn it down, and as the purchase price looked to be over the 
£30,000 section 75 limit, he thought that it was entitled to decline Mr Ms 
misrepresentation claim on that basis. He considered Mr Ms breach of contract claim 
under section 75A of the Consumer Credit Act but he said that he didnt agree that a 
breach of contract had taken place when the supplier went into administration. He 
also said that he hadnt seen any persuasive evidence to show that the loan was 
unaffordable for Mr M at the time that the loan agreement was setup.
Mr Ms representative says that Mr M doesnt agree with our investigators 
recommendations and requires his complaint to be referred to an ombudsman. Mr 
Ms representative has provided a detailed response in which it sets out reasons that 
it considers that Mr Ms complaint should be upheld. It says, in summary and 
amongst other things, that Mr M traded in a number of holiday products as part of a 
purchase of a further holiday product that he made in March 2013 and that he took 
out a further loan with Barclays Partner Finance for £32,924 at that time  and that 
the March 2013 loan demonstrates a continuing relationship with Barclays Partner 
Finance which stretched into a period where any arguments that the period of 
limitation had elapsed dont apply.
Our investigator said that the claim submitted to Barclays Partner Finance was in 
relation to a purchase that took place in October 2010 and that if a further purchase 
or upgrade took place in 2013 and a new loan agreement was made with Barclays 
Partner Finance at that time, Mr M can raise a claim to Barclays Partner Finance in 
relation to that purchase and loan if hes unhappy about it but this service cant 
consider anything relating to a later purchase or loan as part of this complaint.
I said in my provisional decision: I agree with our investigator that Mr Ms complaint 
shouldnt be upheld but for these reasons:
we dont have a free hand to consider every complaint thats referred to us and 
our rules, which were required by law to follow, say  amongst other things  that 
we cant normally deal with a complaint if its referred to us more than six years 
after the event complained of; or (if later) more than three years from the date on 
which the complainant became aware (or ought reasonably to have become 
aware) that they had cause for complaint;
Mr Ms complaint is about Barclays Partner Finances response to the claims that 
had been made to it and I accept that he referred his complaint to this service 
within six years of the date of his representatives January 2021 letter to Barclays 
Partner Finance - but I need to consider whether the Limitation Act 1980 applies 
to his claims;
Mr Ms claims were made under sections 75 and 140A but Im not determining 
the outcome of those claims in this decision as only a court would be able to do 
that - Im considering whether or not Barclays Partner Finances response to 
those claims was fair and reasonable in the circumstances;
section 75 gives a consumer an equal right to claim against the supplier of goods 
or services or the provider of credit if theres been a breach of contract or 
misrepresentation by the supplier (provided that certain criteria set out in that 
section are met);
one of those criteria is that section 75 doesnt apply so far as the claim relates to 
any single item to which the supplier has attached a cash price not exceeding 
£100 or more than £30,000;
Mr M and his wife bought three holiday products from the holiday company which 
are listed on the purchase agreement and the total price for those three products 
was £30,750  no separate price for each of the products was set out in the 
agreement but I consider it to be unlikely that the holiday company had attached 
a cash price of more than £30,000 to any one of the products so I consider it to 
be more likely than not that section 75 would apply in these circumstances;
Mr Ms claim under section 75 is that the holiday company has gone into 
liquidation so is in breach of contract and that the holiday product was 
misrepresented to him and his wife and that they wouldnt have bought it if it 
hadnt been misrepresented to them - if the criteria for a claim under section 75 
were met, Barclays Partner Finance would be expected to consider that claim 
unless the claim was brought outside of the time limits set out in the Limitation 
Act in which case it would be entitled to rely on the Limitation Act and to not consider the claim;
the time limit for a misrepresentation claim (whether under section 2 or 9 of the 
Limitation Act) is six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued 
(which is when everything needed to make a claim had occurred);
I consider that Mr M could have made a claim to the holiday company or Barclays 
Partner Finance about the misrepresentations that he says induced him and his 
wife into buying the holiday products in October 2010 as that was the latest time 
that any misrepresentations would have been made and any loss would have 
been incurred as that was when he also entered into the loan agreement with 
Barclays Partner Finance;
I consider that his cause of action accrued at that time, so he would have had six 
years from then to bring a misrepresentation claim against either the holiday 
company or Barclays Partner Finance  but a claim wasnt made under section 
75 until January 2021, more than ten years later which was outside of the time 
limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that Barclays Partner Finance has 
a defence to the claim and I find that it wouldnt have been unreasonable for it to 
have rejected that claim;
the time limit for a breach of contract claim is also six years from the date on 
which the cause of action accrued  I understand that the holiday company went 
into liquidation in January 2020 and Mr Ms representative made a breach of 
contract claim to Barclays Partner Finance in January 2021 so I consider that Mr 
Ms breach of contract claim was made in time;
our investigator said that the resort at which Mr M and his wife had two of their 
three products was still available for use by members so he didnt agree that a 
breach of contract had taken place because the holiday company had gone into 
administration;
he also said that the resort at which Mr M and his wife had their other product 
stopped providing services to members around 2019 but he said that Mr M had 
upgraded that product in 2013 so the product that he and his wife had bought in 
October 2010 wouldve likely ended at that point and would no longer have been 
active when the resort stopped providing services;
although Mr Ms representative has provided a detailed response to our 
investigators recommendations and says that the March 2013 loan demonstrates 
a continuing relationship with Barclays Partner Finance which stretched into a 
period where any arguments that the period of limitation had elapsed dont apply, 
Im not persuaded that either Mr M or his representative has provided enough 
evidence to show that Mr M still had the holiday product in 2019 that he and his 
wife had bought in October 2010 or that they hadnt traded-in that product for 
another holiday product in 2013;
nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that Mr Ms use of the 
holiday products that he and his wife bought in October 2010 has been adversely 
impacted by the liquidation of the holiday company so I dont consider that it 
would be fair or reasonable for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to take 
any action under section 75 in response to the liquidation of the holiday company;
Mr Ms representative says that there was an unfair relationship between Mr M 
and Barclays Partner Finance because Barclays Partner Finance paid a 
commission to the holiday company which wasnt declared to Mr M and the 
holiday company unduly pressured him into entering the contracts and used 
aggressive commercial practices to pressure him;section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor 
to repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines 
that theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor;
the courts have said, when considering section 140A, that the time for limitation 
purposes runs from the date that the credit agreement ended (if it was not still 
running at the time the claim was made) and the limitation period for a claim 
under section 140A is six years;
Barclays Partner Finance says that Mr Ms loan was settled in full in September 
2012 and Ive not been provided with any evidence to show that the loan 
agreement continued after that time so Im satisfied that the loan agreement 
ended in September 2012 and Im not persuaded that the March 2013 loan 
shows that the relationship between Mr M and Barclays Partner Finance arising 
from the October 2010 loan agreement continued after the loan was settled in 
September 2012;
I consider that Mr M would have had six years from September 2012 to bring a 
claim under section 140A against Barclays Partner Finance but a claim wasnt 
made until January 2021, more than eight years later which was outside of the 
time limits set out in the Limitation Act so I consider that Barclays Partner 
Finance has a defence to the claim and I find that it wouldnt have been 
unreasonable for it to have rejected that claim;
Mr Ms representative also says that the holiday company failed to conduct a 
proper assessment of Mr Ms ability to afford the loan and Mr M says that the 
purchase caused a financial shortage situation in his familys life as they had to 
curtail expenditure on other needs of a growing family life to ensure that there 
were sufficient funds left to pay the loan each month and that he had to work 
additional overtime shifts to obtain additional funds - but Ive seen no other 
evidence to show that the loan wasnt affordable for Mr M in October 2010 when 
it was made to him or that hes experienced any financial difficulties since then;
Ive also seen no evidence to show that Mr M asked Barclays Partner Finance for 
any information about its assessment of his ability to afford the loan before his 
representatives January 2021 letter  as the loan was made to him in October 
2010 and was settled in September 2012, I consider that it would be reasonable 
to expect him to have raised any concerns about that assessment or the 
affordability of the loan before then;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan wasnt 
affordable for Mr M in October 2010 when it was made to him;
Ive seen no evidence to show that Barclays Partner Finance responded to the 
claims that had been made to it by Mr Ms representative in January 2021 so I 
cant say that its response to them was fair and reasonable  but if it had properly 
responded to Mr Ms claims I consider that it would have been fair and 
reasonable for it not to have upheld them; and
I sympathise with Mr M for the issues that hes had with his holiday products and 
the other difficulties that hes described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable in these circumstances for me to require Barclays Partner Finance to 
refund to him any of the money that he paid under the loan agreement, to pay 
him any compensation or to take any other action in response to his complaint.
Subject to any further comments or evidence that I received from any of Mr M, his 
representative and Barclays Partner Finance, my provisional decision was that I didnt intend 
to uphold this complaint. Barclays Partner Finance says that it has nothing to add and neither Mr M nor his representative has responded to my provisional decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
As neither Mr M nor his representative has responded to my provisional decision, I see no 
reason to change the findings that I set out in my provisional decision.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Ms complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr M to accept or 
reject my decision before 27 November 2023.
