The complaint
Mrs S complains that Gain Credit LLC trading as Lending Stream lent to her irresponsibly. 
What happened
Mrs S was given 15 loans by Gain Credit between November 2014 and January 2016. All 
the loans were short-term instalment loans, to be repaid over 6 months. The amount 
borrowed ranged from £90 to £680.
As the table below shows, some of these loans ran concurrently. I understand a summary of 
Mrs S's borrowing to be as follows:
Loan Date Taken Date Repaid Amount
1 15/11/2014 25/11/2014 £380.00
2 11/12/2014 31/12/2014 £250.00
3 23/01/2015 27/02/2015 £190.00
4 16/02/2015 27/02/2015 £220.00
5 24/02/2015 27/02/2015 £90.00
6 25/03/2015 27/03/2015 £250.00
7 18/04/2015 25/04/2015 £220.00
8 25/04/2015 28/04/2015 £120.00
9 11/06/2015 23/06/2015 £130.00
10 13/06/2015 24/06/2015 £120.00
11 17/06/2015 25/06/2015 £250.00
12 15/08/2015 28/08/2015 £130.00
13 24/09/2015 28/09/2015 £250.00
14 07/12/2015 07/12/2015 £200.00
15 01/01/2016 19/09/2017 £680.00
Mrs S's complaint has been assessed by one of our adjudicators. He thought that Gain 
Credit shouldnt have provided loans 5 to 15 and he asked Gain Credit to pay Mrs S some 
compensation. I havent seen any response from Gain Credit to the adjudicators 
assessment. So the complaint has been passed to me for a final decision on the matter.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term lending - including all of 
the relevant rules, guidance and good industry practice - on our website.
Gain Credit needed to take reasonable steps to ensure that it didn't lend irresponsibly. This 
means that it should have carried out proportionate checks to satisfy itself that Mrs S could 
repay the loans in a sustainable way. Gain Credit's checks could take into account a number 
of different things, such as how much was being lent, the repayment amounts and the 
consumers income and expenditure. In the early stages of a lending relationship, I think less 
thorough checks might be reasonable and proportionate. 
But I've also considered if there were any other factors that might indicate that Gain Credit 
should fairly and reasonably have done more to establish whether the lending was 
sustainable for Mrs S.
 Such factors include:
the lower a customers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income);
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming,  
unsustainable).
There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. 
Ive carefully considered all the evidence, arguments and information Ive seen about this 
matter and what it means for Mrs S. 
Mrs Ss loans were all repayable over 6 months. So the amounts that she needed to repay 
each month were smaller than if shed taken a normal payday loan. But she had to make 
those repayments over a longer timeframe. So Ive considered the total amount that Mrs S 
needed to repay to Gain Credit every month, and the period over which these payments had 
to be sustained.
Gain Credit carried out some checks before it gave each loan to Mrs S. This included asking 
Mrs S for details of her income and expenditure and gathering information from credit 
reference agencies. 
I think that the checks Gain Credit did before agreeing the first four loans were likely to have 
been reasonable and proportionate, given the amount it was lending to Mrs S, in comparison 
with her income, what Mrs S had told Gain Credit about her circumstances and the length of 
the lending relationship. I dont think it wouldve been proportionate for Gain Credit to ask 
Mrs S for the amount of information that would be needed to show the lending was 
unsustainable before agreeing loans 1 to 4. So I am not upholding the complaint about these 
loans.
But I do think Gain Credit should have carried out more thorough checks before agreeing to 
loans 5 to 9. I accept that loan 5 was for a smaller amount that the previous lending. But 
Loans 3 and 4 were still open when Mrs S applied for her fifth loan. And from what Ive seen, 
I think had Gain Credit carried out better checks at the time, it would most likely have 
discovered that Mrs S was borrowing from at least one other short-term lender, in addition to 
her two open Gain Credit loans. I think Gain Credit ought reasonably to have realised that 
Mrs S might be having difficulties managing her money when she applied for her fifth loan. 
And I think the lender should also reasonably have been aware that Mrs Ss financial position wasnt substantially improving, when she applied for loans 6 to 9. Knowing this 
information, I dont think Gain Credit ought reasonably to have concluded that Mrs S could 
repay loans 5 to 9 in a sustainable way. So it ought not to have given these loans to her.
I agree with our adjudicator that by loan 10, Mrs Ss overall pattern of borrowing suggested 
shed become persistently reliant on Gain Credits lending. This was Mrs Ss tenth 
consecutive loan application in around eight months. And the amount she was borrowing 
wasnt significantly declining. Mrs S had consistently borrowed and rapidly repaid her loans, 
only to return and borrow again shortly afterwards. I think this could reasonably have 
suggested to Gain Credit that Mrs S was borrowing further to manage the gaps in her 
finances created when she repaid previous loans. 
Gain Credit has said it thinks the checks it carried out showed that the loans were affordable 
for Mrs S. 
But I think it should reasonably have realised that by the tenth loan, Mrs S was no longer 
borrowing to meet a short-term, emergency need, but that she was most likely now 
borrowing to keep up with her ongoing financial commitments. Gain Credit was required to 
establish whether Mrs S could sustainably repay her loans  over the full term of the loan, 
not just whether the loan payments were affordable on a strict pounds and pence 
calculation. I think that by offering one loan after another, over a prolonged period, the 
overall effect was likely to increase Mrs Ss indebtedness in an unsustainable manner. I think 
Gain Credit should have reasonably questioned whether it should continue to offer short-
term loans to this consumer, whose repeated borrowing suggested that she had become 
reliant on the lending - which the rules and guidance made clear should only be for a short-
term purpose, and not for long term financial problems.
So in conclusion, I don't think Gain Credit should have agreed to provide Mrs S with loans 5 
to 15. So Gain Credit should put things right for Mrs S.
Putting things right
I understand Gain Credit sold the outstanding debt on loan 15 to a third party. If so, it should 
buy this back if it is able to do so and then take the following steps. If it is not able to buy any 
debts back, then Gain Credit should liaise with the new debt owner to achieve the results 
outlined below. 
Gain Credit should: 
A) Add together the total of the repayments made by Mrs S towards interest, fees and 
charges on all upheld loans without an outstanding balance, not including anything that has 
already been refunded.
B) Calculate 8% simple interest* on the individual payments made by Mrs S which were 
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Mrs S originally made the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled.
C) Remove all interest, fees and charges from the balance on any upheld outstanding loans, 
and treat any repayments made by Mrs S as though they had been repayments of the 
principal on all outstanding loans. If this results in Mrs S having made overpayments then 
Gain Credit should refund these overpayments with 8% simple interest* calculated on the 
overpayments, from the date the overpayments would have arisen, to the date the complaint 
is settled. Gain Credit should then refund the amounts calculated in A and B and move to 
step E.D) If there is still an outstanding balance then the amounts calculated in A and B should 
be used to repay any balance remaining on any outstanding loans. If this results in a surplus 
then the surplus should be paid to Mrs S. If there is still an outstanding balance then Gain 
Credit should try to agree an affordable repayment plan with Mrs S. 
E) Remove any adverse information recorded on Mrs Ss credit file in relation to loans 5 to 9. 
The overall pattern of borrowing for loans 10 to 15 means any information recorded about 
them is adverse, so these loans should be removed entirely from Mrs Ss credit file. Gain 
Credit does not have to remove any outstanding loan 15 from Mrs Ss credit file until these 
have been repaid, but it should still remove any adverse information recorded about these 
loans.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Gain Credit to deduct tax from this interest. Gain Credit 
should give Mrs S a certificate showing how much tax youve deducted, if she asks for one.
My final decision
My final decision is that I partly uphold Mrs Ss complaint and direct Gain Credit LLC trading 
as Lending Stream to put things right as set out above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 26 November 2020.
