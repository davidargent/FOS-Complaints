The complaint
Ms H complains that National Westminster Bank PLC restricted and then closed her current 
account.
What happened
Ms H had a current account with NatWest. In December 2019, NatWest decided to close it. 
NatWest says it wrote to Ms H, giving her 60 days notice of this.
 
But Ms H says she didnt receive the notice  and says she only discovered what had 
happened after NatWest placed a block on her account in February 2020. 
NatWest then closed the account in March 2020. It sent Ms H a cheque for the balance. 
Ms H, however, had changed her name  which meant she wasnt able to pay the cheque 
into her new account. 
While all this was happening, Ms H didnt have access to the funds  which she says caused 
financial difficulties. Dissatisfied, she complained to NatWest and then referred the complaint 
to us.
Our investigator looked at this. She concluded that NatWest was able to close the account in 
line with its terms and conditions. She wasnt persuaded that the business should have 
blocked the account as it did  as this meant Ms H wasnt able to withdraw her funds. She 
also thought that NatWest could have explained better what Ms H needed to do to change 
the name on the account. 
The investigator initially recommended NatWest pay Ms H £250. But after NatWest send us 
additional information she reviewed the complaint and instead recommended NatWest pay 
Ms H £100. She also asked NatWest to send Ms H the outstanding balance, together with 
simple interest to compensate Ms H for the time shed been out of pocket.
NatWest agreed with the investigator. Ms H didnt. The complaint has been passed to me to 
decide.
Ms H has also complained that NatWest has registered a default against two of her loans. 
These accounts are separate from the current account, so Im not going to comment on 
these further in this decision. Theyll be looked at as a separate complaint.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive first considered the closure of the account. Generally speaking, banks are allowed to 
make commercial decisions about who can bank with them. And where a bank decides to 
close a customers account, it doesnt need to give a reason or an explanation. The main 
question I need to consider is whether, when it closed the account, NatWest complied with 
the relevant terms and conditions.
In Ms Hs case, the terms and conditions say NatWest can close her account as long as it 
gives her at least 60 days notice. Based on what Ive seen, NatWest sent Ms H a letter on 
17 December 2019 to say it had decided to close her account. This meant Ms H had until 15 
February 2020 to find a new bank. Based on what Ms H has said, she first had problems 
using the account on 14 February 2020, which is a day before the expiry of that period. The 
accounts were then blocked on 20 February 2020  which was after the 60-day period had 
ended  though the account itself wasnt formally closed until 26 March. As such, I think 
NatWest has substantially complied with its terms and conditions.
Ms H says she didnt receive this notice  and so only discovered what was happening in 
February after her debit card stopped working and she received notices from suppliers that 
her direct debits had been cancelled. Ive thought about this. The letter from NatWest was 
addressed correctly, and letter was also one of the methods of communication allowed 
according to the accounts terms and conditions. So though Ms H says she didnt know 
NatWest intended to close her account, this isnt something I can hold NatWest responsible 
for.
Ive next considered the decision to block Ms Hs account. Banks may need to block 
accounts at any time to comply with their legal and regulatory obligations, and again they 
dont need to give reasons why they block an account. In this case, the account was blocked 
on 20 February 2020, which was after the 60 days given in the notice to close the account.  I 
appreciate this was inconvenient for Ms H, as it meant she couldnt withdraw her remaining 
funds from the account.. But I cant say it was wrong for NatWest to have done this  and 
having considered everything I can understand why they did this to comply with their 
responsibilities.
That said, I think NatWest could have explained what was happening better. It doesnt look 
as though it explained what Ms H needed to do to change her name on its systems so she 
could receive the cheque after the blocks were lifted and the account was closed. It appears 
Ms H had to contact the business a number of times before she learned her account had 
been closed. And it also appears there was a delay between the point at which NatWest 
could have lifted the restrictions on the account and the date the account was actually 
closed. I can see this caused Ms H material inconvenience. And if NatWest had explained 
things better, I think Ms H would have received her money by now.
So to put things right, I think NatWest should now send Ms H the £218.85 that was left in her 
account if it hasnt already. It should add interest  the rate is 8% simple per year  from 
26 March 2020 when the account closed until the day Ms H gets it back. It should also pay 
Ms H £100 for the trouble and upset it caused.
My final decision
For the reasons above, I uphold Ms Hs complaint in part. National Westminster Bank Plc 
should put things right by doing what Ive said above.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms H to accept or 
reject my decision before 25 April 2022.
