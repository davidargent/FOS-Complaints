The complaint
Mr P has complained about loans granted to him by Elevate Credit International Limited 
trading as Sunny (Sunny or the lender). Mr P says that Sunny was irresponsible to have 
agreed to lend to him as he couldnt afford the repayments without borrowing again to meet 
his living expenses.
What happened
Sunny agreed 49 loans for Mr P from June 2015 to April 2019 and Mr P owed money to 
Sunny for almost all of that time. The loans were all instalment loans to be repaid over six 
months and ranged in value from £50 to £750. Many of the loans ran concurrently and all 
were repaid in full. The below table sets out some of the information Sunny has provided 
about Mr Ps first twenty loans (with numbers rounded to the nearest pound).

Our adjudicator upheld Mr Ps complaint in part and recommended that Sunny refund all of 
the interest and charges he paid on loans 5 to 49.
Sunny disagreed with this recommendation but offered to refund the interest and charges 
that Mr P paid on loans 25 to 49  because, it said We consider it may have been prudent to 
have done things differently after we granted his twenty fourth loan; due to an increase in the 
amount of money he applied for, coupled with the length of the lending relationship at this 
point I believe we could have asked further questions to establish the state of Mr. [P]s 
finances at this time. 
Mr P didnt accept this offer and Sunny increased it saying it reviewed its position again and 
now offered to refund the interest and charges Mr P paid on loans 18 to 49. Sunny said   
based upon a review of some lending patterns, we accept it would have been prudent of us 
to contact Mr [P] in July 2017 to discuss his financial situation, when he repaid four of his 
loans early and applied for another loan a week later. Therefore, would believe it fair and 
reasonable to uphold the complaint from loan 18.
Mr P didnt accept this offer either and so the complaint has come to me, as an ombudsman, 
for review and final decision. As it seems both parties are in agreement about what needs to 
happen regarding loans 18 onwards, my decision will focus on the loans that remain in 
dispute, in other words loans 1 to 17. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to 
complaints about short-term lending  including all of the relevant rules, guidance and good 
industry practice  on our website. Ive followed that approach here. 
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was the regulator when Mr P took out his loans. The 
relevant rules and guidance set out in its Consumer Credit Sourcebook (CONC) said that for 
all loans Sunny needed to check that he could afford to meet his repayments in a 
sustainable manner. This meant Mr P being able to meet his repayments out of his normal 
income without having to go without or borrow further. 
The regulations werent prescriptive about what checks Sunny needed to carry out in order 
to reasonably assess whether or not Mr P would be able to meet his repayments 
sustainably. But the regulations said that such checks needed to be proportionate. This 
suggests that the same checks might not be the appropriate thing to do for all consumers, or 
for the same consumer in all circumstances.
In general, Id expect a lender to require more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being able to repay the credit in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id 
expect a lender to seek more assurance by carrying out more detailed checks
the lower a consumers income (reflecting that it could be more difficult to make any 
loan repayments to a given loan amount from a lower level of income);
the higher the amount due to be repaid (reflecting that it could be more difficult to 
meet a higher repayment from a particular level of income); 
the greater the number and frequency of loans, and the longer the period of time 
during which a customer has been given loans (reflecting the risk that repeated 
refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or was becoming, 
unsustainable).There may even come a point where the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly 
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable. 
Sunny says it asked Mr P for information about his income and expenses each time he 
applied for a loan. It recorded his monthly income as £1,700 when he first applied, which 
increased to £1,790 for his fifth loan onwards and rose to £2,349 for his later loans. It 
recorded his monthly expenses as ranging from £731 to £1,620. The lender also said that it 
checked Mr Ps credit record through a third-party credit reference agency (CRA) and took 
into consideration his existing credit commitments. It hasnt provided these figures but has 
provided some summary information. 
Mr P applied for his first loan in June 2015. This was for £500 with a monthly repayment of 
about £167. It seems he took out a second loan, for £150, while his first one was still running 
and repaid both of them a week later. The income and expenditure information gathered 
suggests that Mr P would be able to afford these loans. 
I note that Sunnys customer record for Mr P shows that it found evidence that he was in a 
debt management plan when he first applied for a loan and that he had defaulted on a debt 
in the previous four months when he applied for his second loan. I understand that the debt 
management plan had been in place for some time. Mr P then took out his third loan (for 
£450) a few weeks after repaying his second and took out his fourth (for £250) a few weeks 
after repaying his third.
Taking everything into consideration and bearing in mind that this was early in their lending 
relationship and so it wasnt unreasonable of Sunny to rely on the information Mr P provided, 
Ive concluded  that Sunny wasnt irresponsible to provide loans 1 to 4.
However, I think this pattern of borrowing and repaying ought to have begun to raise 
concerns for Sunny about the sustainability of its loans for Mr P as it suggests he needed to 
borrow again to meet the shortfall  left by repaying the loans. And when Mr P applied for his 
fifth loan just a week or so after taking out his fourth I think Sunny ought to have sought a 
comprehensive understanding of his finances before agreeing to lend to him again.
Mr P has provided a copy of his credit file and I can see from this that he was having 
problems managing his money at that time. He had other outstanding short term loans, had 
defaulted on several loans in the last six months (the largest being about £10,000) and had 
missed payments on his mortgage in the previous few months. I think its likely Sunny would 
have learnt of Mr Ps money problems and, as a responsible lender, would have declined 
loan 5. And when Mr P asked for his sixth loan just two days later, I think it would also have 
declined that. 
Sunny offered to refund the interest and charges Mr P paid from loan 18 onwards, having 
looked at the pattern of lending. I agree that it was irresponsible to have agreed these loans 
but I also think Sunny should have stopped lending to Mr P before then, specifically when he 
asked for a sixth loan in May 2015.
By May 2015 Mr P had been borrowing from Sunny for almost a year. Hed originally 
borrowed £500 and was now indebted for a total of £450. This suggests to me that Mr P had 
an ongoing need for credit, not just a temporary shortfall in income, and he wasnt making 
inroads into what he owed. I think Sunny should have recognised this and declined to 
provide further credit for him. As set out in CONC - a firm should not refinance high-cost 
short-term credit where to do so is unsustainable or otherwise harmful. And, as Sunnys own 
website states, its loans are designed for short term borrowing and customers with longer 
term borrowing needs might want to consider that a lower rate, longer term product would be 
more appropriate. I think Mr P lost out when Sunny agreed loan 6 and went on to agree over 40 more loans for 
him over almost three years because these loans unfairly prolonged his indebtedness and 
allowed him to take expensive credit intended for short term use over an extended period of 
time. The number of loans and length of time he borrowed over was likely to be seen 
negatively by other lenders, potentially keeping him in the market for high cost loans. 
Putting things right
As Ive explained above, I find that Sunny was irresponsible to have agreed further credit for 
Mr P from and including his fifth loan taken out on the 20 May 2016. In order to put things 
right for him, Sunny should
refund all interest and charges Mr P paid on loans 5 to 49 (in other words on loans 
granted from 20 May 2016 up to and including his last loan agreed in April 2019); and
pay interest on all these refunds at 8% simple* per year from the dates of payment to 
the dates of settlement; and
remove any adverse information about loan 5 from Mr Ps credit file and remove all 
information about loans 6 onwards because any information recorded about these 
loan is adverse.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to take off tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Mr P a certificate showing how much tax its taken off if he asks for one.
My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I am upholding Mr Ps complaint and require Elevate Credit 
International Limited trading as Sunny to put things right for him as Ive outlined.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr P to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 May 2020.
