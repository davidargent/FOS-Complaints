The complaint
Miss C complains that Lloyds Bank PLC was irresponsible when it approved her bank 
account overdrafts for her. 
Miss C also complains that loans approved for her around the same time were lent 
irresponsibly. That complaint has been dealt with separately to this one. 
What happened
Miss C had a bank account with Lloyds and in December 2015 she applied on-line for an 
overdraft and later it was increased to £1,500. She complained to Lloyds 28 January 2022.
Miss C has included a summary in her complaint letter which is: 
Account opened on or around 13th April 2015
Overdraft of £400  in or around 01/12/2015 
Loan 2 of £2000  on or around 09/12/2015 
Overdraft 2 of £1500 on or around 15/07/2016
Loan 2 of £1000 on or around 22/07/2016
I think that Miss C may have meant Loan 1 for the December 2015 loan.
Miss C explains in her complaint letter to Lloyds: 
If you had properly checked my credit record before increasing my limit, you would 
have seen that in the two years since my account with you was opened, I had got 
additional late payment markers and defaults and taken out a lot of other credit. This 
should have warned you I was struggling with my finances, and it was not 
responsible to lend me more. By increasing my credit facility, you made my financial 
position worse.
Miss C has not got copies of her bank account statements and the account was closed some 
years ago, but she has records which are copies of returned payments on her telephone. 
She has not sent those records to us. An example she gives is that on 3 June her payment 
for the first loan was refused and yet, Miss C says, Lloyds approved for her another loan of 
£1,000 on 22 July 2016. 
Lloyds responded with its final response letter (FRL) in March 2022 and made several points 
which are summarised here:
- it has reviewed from January 2016 and no earlier as it said it was obliged to review 
applications by Miss C for the previous six years before her complaint which had 
been January 2022. 
- each overdraft (and loan) application was made over the internet
- the first time Miss C told them she was having difficulties with her finances was 
October 2016 
- before lending Lloyds checked Miss Cs credit score and used what it already knew 
about Miss C to assess whether shed likely be able to repay the lending
- Lloyds carried out an assessment of her income and expenditure (I&E) and 
supplemented that information with statistical knowledge from the Office of National 
Statistics (ONS data).
- Lloyds recognised that Miss C had had some returned direct debits in the month 
before her applications but it did not consider it was wrong to have provided her with 
the additional lending
Lloyds said that its assessment showed: 
Your bank statements leading up to your loan and overdraft applications show you 
were receiving a monthly salary payment and making regular payments to your 
existing personal loan. You were also using your bank account for non-essential 
spending and keeping your account balance within your arranged overdraft limit.
In August 2017 Lloyds was approached on Miss Cs behalf by a well known charitable debt 
advice service and the amount being offered to repay the loans and overdraft led it to 
consider that Miss C needed long term support. So, it closed her bank account and passed 
the debt to its Recoveries Team. Later the debts were sold to third party agencies. The 
account debt was passed to a different third party to the loan debt and Lloyds has no 
up-to-date information on the status of those debts. 
Lloyds has referred to the defaults being removed by December 2023 (due to the passage 
of time meaning the six year period) and so that leads me to think that Lloyds defaulted her 
bank account and loan accounts in December 2017. 
Lloyds has sent us records and details of Miss Cs account history and her copy bank 
statements all of which I have reviewed. 
One of our adjudicators looked at the complaint. As I outlined at the beginning of this 
decision, the assessment of the loan complaint has been (or is going to be) dealt with 
separately to the complaint surrounding the overdraft approvals. 
Our adjudicator did not consider that Lloyds had acted irresponsibly in approving the 
overdraft or any limit increase. The checks Lloyds carried out were reasonable and 
proportionate in the circumstances. 
The unresolved complaint was passed to me to decide. 
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Lloyds will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we consider 
when looking at whether a bank treated a customer fairly and reasonably when applying 
overdraft charges. So, I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. 
An arranged overdraft is a fixed borrowing limit, agreed in advance, which allows the 
consumer to spend up to that limit, through all the usual payment methods. This will usually be at a cost, either through a fixed monthly or daily fee whilst the account is overdrawn, 
and/or interest charged on the overdrawn balance. 
The questions I ask myself when considering a complaint of this nature are: Did the lender 
carry out reasonable and proportionate checks to satisfy itself that the borrower would be 
able to repay any credit in a sustainable way? If so, was a fair lending decision made? If not, 
what would such checks more likely than not have shown?
Loans
I am not assessing Miss Cs complaint about the loans but here are some factual points 
which I do consider relevant when looking at Miss Cs overdraft history.
The first loan approved in December 2015 was paid for regularly until 24 April 2017 before 
there were any returned payments. Then there was another direct debit return on 
3 June2017, and again on 5 July 2017. I think that Miss C has a record of a 3 June direct 
debit rejection but that would have been 2017 and I think that Miss C may have assumed it 
was June 2016.
The second loan was approved for £1,000 on 22 July 2016 and again, the first time any 
rejected direct debits are recorded was on 3 February 2017. This second loan post-dates the 
15 July 2016 overdraft application I have been asked to look at. 
Overdrafts
Lloyds FRL does not cover all the overdraft applications  just the ones from January 2016 
and so that is the parameter of my decision. 
Using the records Lloyds has passed to me, here is a duplication of most of the Lloyds 
summary of the overdraft position on the account. All these applications were done by 
Miss C on-line.
Date Existing situation Application amount result
16 June 2015 £0 £1,000 refer
10 July 2015 £0 £2,000 decline
17 August 2015 £0 £100 accept
16 September 2015 £100 £220 accept
16 September 2015 £220 £550 decline
1 December 2015 £220 £400 accept
3 December 2015 £400 £1,000 accept
22 March 2016 £1,000 £1,600 decline
20 April 2016 £1,000 £1,200 decline
3 June 2016 £1,000 £2,000 decline
15 July 2016 £1,000 £2,000 refer
15 July 2016 £1,000 £1,500 accept
22 July 2016 £1,500 £2,500 decline
Each application after this  of which there were 12 between 17 August 2016 and 
20 April 2017  were declined. Miss Cs overdraft facility remained at £1,500 
Notes from Lloyds has shown me that Miss C had experienced returned direct debits in 
June 2016 and for the 15 July 2016 on-line application she had given her annual salary of 
£22,675 and had indicated that her expenditure was £0. Some of Lloyds notes state that 
Miss C was using her account to pay other loan companies and was repaying a loan to 
Lloyds. The Lloyds notes say that this application was referred and then accepted. So this 
shows me that Lloyds knew the details and had assessed the application being aware of them.
The application immediately after that on 22 July 2016 was declined and all others following. 
As for the 15 July 2016 overdraft facility approved for £1,500  increased from £1,000  
having looked at it all in the round, including a review of Miss Cs bank statements 
transactions then I do not see enough there to consider that Lloyds was likely to be 
particularly concerned. I think that its likely that any issue it may have had likely was dealt 
with as the application was referred but a relatively modest increase of £500 to £1,500 was 
not wrong in my view. 
Miss C did have two returned direct debts in June 2016. But this appeared to have been a 
one time event and it was not a regular occurrence for Miss C. If it had been I would have 
likely taken a different view. 
And the spending on her account before these direct debits were returned did not look to 
have been for other bills and priority payments, but rather for non-essential items. So, it 
looks more to have been down to financial management than financial difficulties at that 
stage. And I have seen from Lloyds assessment notes that was what Lloyds had assessed 
as well. That does not strike me as being an inappropriate assessment of Miss Cs finances 
at the time. 
Although I am not assessing the loans as part of this complaint, I can see that Miss C had 
been paying loan 1  the only one she had at that time with Lloyds  regularly and with no 
concerns up to that point in time. And as I outlined earlier, the missed payment for loan 1 on 
3 June was not for 2016 but for 2017 and so that post-dates the 15 July 2016 overdraft credit 
limit extension and therefore not relevant. 
Miss Cs bank statements do reveal that she was paying one other lender regularly around 
£79 a month, but that one other alone would not be enough to be a concern to Lloyds.  
Nothing here leads me to think that Lloyds assessment of her application or the overdraft on 
15 July 2016 was wrongly dealt with.
I note that after that all applications were declined which suggests that Lloyds did keep her 
borrowing contained with its declines.
My final decision
My final decision is that part of the overdraft element of Miss Cs complaint relating to the 
15 July 2016 application by her, I do not uphold her complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss C to accept 
or reject my decision before 22 July 2022.
