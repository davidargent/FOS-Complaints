The complaint
Ms S complains that PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA (PayPal) irresponsibly gave her a 
credit account that she couldnt afford.
What happened
On 15 December 2018, Ms Ss credit account was opened by PayPal with an initial credit 
limit of £600. This credit limit was never increased. 
In 2022, Ms S complained to PayPal to say that the account shouldnt have been opened 
because it wasnt affordable and that PayPal ought to have made a better effort to 
understand her financial circumstances before opening the credit card. 
Our investigator didnt recommend the complaint be upheld. Ms S didnt agree. So, the 
complaint has been passed to me to decide.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ive read and considered the whole file, but Ill confine my comments to what I think is 
relevant. If I dont comment on any specific point its not because Ive failed to consider it 
but because I dont think I need to comment on it in order to reach what I think is the right 
outcome in the wider context. My remit is to take an overview and decide whats fair in 
the round.
PayPal will be familiar with all the rules, regulations and good industry practice we 
consider when looking at a complaint concerning unaffordable and irresponsible lending. 
So, I dont consider it necessary to set all of this out in this decision. Information about our 
approach to these complaints is set out on our website.
Ms Ss complaint is that PayPal made credit available that was unaffordable. PayPal has 
explained that it relied in part on information that Ms S provided at the time of application 
to assess affordability. At the time of application Ms S declared a full-time income that was 
far from modest and regular expenses that were modest. So, on the face of it there 
seemed little reason not to provide credit. 
PayPal also said they carried out a credit search in Ms Ss name to assess Ms Ss level of 
debt at that time and to understand how she had been managing that debt. With that 
information and using their own scoring metric, PayPal decided to agree to the credit limit 
of £600. So, there was some assessment of affordability at the time of the lending 
decision. But Im not sure that more searching enquiries would have put PayPal off 
providing the credit they did. 
I say this because the initial credit limit was modest and the maximum monthly payments 
for that credit were also relatively modest. And Ms S has provided her credit file and I have 
noted that Ms Ss credit file was very clean at the time of the loan application. When I say 
this, I mean that Ms Ss management of her existing credit showed no recent history of 
CCJs, defaults or any late payments. So, it seemed from the credit file that at the point 
that the lending decision was made, Ms S was affording her existing credit. And so, 
PayPal were not put on notice of any reason not to agree the lending from that. And so, I 
dont think that the information that PayPal had at the time of the lending decision, would 
have led them to feel they ought to make more searching enquiries of Ms Ss financial 
situation. 
I have to look at the information that was available to PayPal at the time it made its lending 
decisions and not to use hindsight. And I have seen insufficient evidence that the other 
information that PayPal acquired or had presented to it at the time of the lending decision, 
would have led them to think that the relatively modest credit they were offering was 
unreasonable. 
So, having considered all the submissions made in this case, I have seen insufficient 
evidence to think that the credit PayPal provided to Ms S was unreasonable. 
My final decision
For the reasons given above, I dont uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms S to accept or 
reject my decision before 15 February 2023.
