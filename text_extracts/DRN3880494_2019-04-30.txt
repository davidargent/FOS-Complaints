K821x#15complaint
Miss D complains Elevate  Credit  International Limited (trading as sunny.co.uk) (Sunny)  lent 
to her irresponsibly.
background
The background to this complaint and my initial findings on it can be found  in my provisional 
decision which is attached  to and forms a part of this final decision.
In summary  however,  I concluded  Sunny shouldnt have given Miss D the sixth to 29th loans 
it had agreed for her, and that it should  honour an earlier offer it had made in respect of her 
first to fifth loans. I invited  Miss D and Sunny to comment on my findings.
Miss D said she accepted my findings,  but Sunny didnt reply.  So the case  has now been  
returned to me to review.
my findings
Ive considered once  again all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general  approach  
to complaints about short-term lending - including  all of the relevant rules, guidance and 
good industry practice - on our website.
Neither party to the complaint has put forward any new evidence  or arguments for me to 
consider, and having reviewed the case again  I see no reason to depart from the findings I 
made in my provisional  decision. It follows that I uphold Miss Ds complaint in relation to 
loans 6 to 29, and will be directing Sunny to honour  its initial offer in respect  of loans 1 to 5 
(which I understand  it has implemented  in any event).
Ref: DRN38804942putting things right
Sunny shouldnt have given Miss D loans 6 to 29, so its not right that she should have had 
to pay interest or charges  on these,  or have them affect her credit file. So to put things right I 
direct Sunny to:
A.Add together the total of the repayments made by Miss D towards interest,  fees and 
charges on loans 6 to 29.
B.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments  made by Miss D which 
were considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss D originally made  the 
payments, to the date the complaint is settled.
C.If it chooses to, use the total of A plus B to repay any unpaid principal on loans 27 
to 29.
D.Pay any remaining refund to Miss D.
E.Remove any information it has recorded  on Miss Ds credit file in relation to loans 6 
to 29.
For the avoidance of doubt  the redress  outlined  above is in addition to the offer Sunny has 
already made and implemented, which it must  honour.  
*HM Revenue & Customs requires Sunny to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny must give 
Miss D a certificate showing how much tax it has deducted, if she asks for one.
my final decision
For the reasons  explained above and in my attached provisional decision, I uphold Miss Ds 
complaint and direct Elevate Credit  International Limited to take the actions outlined  in the 
putting things right  section of this final decision.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss D to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 May 2019.

complaint
Miss D complains  Elevate  Credit International Limited  (trading as sunny.co.uk) (Sunny) lent to her 
irresponsibly. 
background
Miss D took out 29 loans  with Sunny between June 2015 and June 2017.  Ive included a table at the 
end of my decision which sets out some of the information weve  received about  these loans.
The loans Sunny gave  Miss D were all instalment  loans which were  generally repayable over a six 
month period. Miss D usually paid off her loans early,  but tended to borrow again shortly afterwards 
and often had multiple loans running at the same time. On 8 June 2017  one day before  she 
received her last loan  Miss D complained  about Sunnys decisions to lend to her. She explained  she 
had been borrowing  very regularly and had financial  trouble, and she thought at some point Sunny 
should have stopped lending to her.
Sunny said it didnt entirely agree with Miss D, but it thought there were signs  some of its loans  might 
have been unsuitable for her. It offered  to refund all the charges and interest on loans 1 to 5 and 
remove them  from her credit  file. It noted that because Miss D still owed about  Â£580 on her remaining 
loans, it would  use her refund to reduce  the balance she still owed. It said it would write off whatever  
was left over,  so Miss D would  have nothing further to pay.
Miss D was dissatisfied  with this response and referred her complaint to this service, where it was 
looked into by an adjudicator. He concluded Miss D had in fact been  able to afford  all the loans Sunny 
hadnt made an offer in respect of, so he didnt think her complaint should  succeed.  He asked if Miss 
D would still like to accept Sunnys offer. Miss D said she hadnt been given a choice whether to 
accept the offer, and Sunny  had already  taken the actions  it had offered  to take  except for 
amending her credit  file. She asked for her complaint  to be reviewed  by an ombudsman, so the case 
has been passed to me to decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint. Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  
lending - including all of the relevant rules,  guidance and good  industry practice  - on our website.
Sunny had to assess Miss Ds applications  for borrowing to check if she could afford  to pay back  the 
amounts shed borrowed  without undue difficulty. It needed to do this in a way which was 
proportionate to the circumstances. Sunnys checks could have taken into account a number of 
different things, such as how much  was being lent, the size of the repayments and Miss Ds income 
and expenditure. With this in mind, I think in the early stages of a lending relationship,  less thorough 
checks might have been proportionate.
But certain factors might  suggest that Sunny should have done more to establish  that any lending was 
sustainable for Miss D. These factors include:
Miss D having  a low income (reflecting  that it could be more  difficult  to make any loan 
repayments to a given loan amount  from a lower level of income);
The amounts to be repaid  being especially  high (reflecting that it could be more  difficult  to 
meet a higher repayment  from a particular level of income);
Miss D having  a large number of loans and/or having these  loans over a long period of time 
(reflecting the risk that repeated refinancing may signal that the borrowing had become, or 
Ref: DRN38804944was becoming,  unsustainable);
Miss D coming back for loans shortly after repaying previous borrowing, or while previous  
borrowing was still outstanding (also suggestive of the borrowing  becoming unsustainable).
There may even come a point  where  the lending history and pattern of lending itself clearly  
demonstrates that the lending was unsustainable  for Miss D.
Sunny was required to establish whether Miss D could sustainably repay her loans  not just whether  
she technically had enough money to make  her repayments. Having enough  money to make the 
repayments could of course  be an indicator  that Miss D was able to repay  her loans sustainably. But it 
doesnt automatically  follow  that this is the case. The FCAs Consumer Credit  Sourcebook  (CONC) 
states payments are sustainable if they are made without undue  difficulties and in particular, made on 
time, while meeting other  reasonable commitments  and without having  to borrow to make them. If a 
lender realises, or ought  reasonably to have realised, that a borrower wont be able to make  their 
repayments without borrowing further,  then it follows that it should conclude those  repayments are 
unsustainable.
Ive considered all of the arguments, evidence  and information provided  in this context, and thought  
about what this means for Miss Ds complaint.  Sunny has already said it shouldnt have given Miss D 
loans 1 to 5, so Ive focused  my investigation  on loans 6 to 29.
By the time Miss D had applied for loan 6 shed  taken  a significant number of loans over a short  
space of time (about  three months).  Some of these  loans  Miss D had held simultaneously,  meaning 
she had multiple repayments  to make in the same month. I think Miss Ds pattern of borrowing should 
have suggested to Sunny that she didnt just have a short-term  cash-flow problem, but a persistent  
shortage of funds which she was borrowing  in order to top up. High-cost,  short-term  loans of the kind 
offered by Sunny  are not suitable for this kind of use, and I think  Sunny should have recognised the 
signs Miss D was likely using the loans  in this way.
Apart from a period of about five months where she stopped  borrowing temporarily, Miss D never 
made any real inroads  to the amount  she owed Sunny. Loan  29 was taken  out two years  after her first 
loan, and was for the same amount. So Miss D had paid large amounts  of interest to, in effect, service 
a debt to Sunny over an extended period. 
I dont think it was right of Sunny to allow Miss D to take expensive credit intended  for short-term use 
over this kind of period. In doing so, it unfairly  prolonged her indebtedness, and the large number of 
loans was likely to have  had negative  implications on her ability  to access mainstream credit,  keeping  
her in the market  for these high-cost loans.
Ref: DRN38804945Taking all of this into account, I dont think Sunny  should have given Miss D any of loans 6 to 29.
putting things  right
Sunny has already made an offer in respect  of loans  1 to 5, which  I intend to direct it to honour.  But it 
also shouldnt have given  Miss D loans 6 to 29, so it isnt right that she should have had to pay 
interest or charges on these, or have them affect  her credit file. So to put things right I intend to direct 
Sunny to:
F.Add together the total of the repayments made by Miss D towards interest, fees and charges  
on loans 6 to 29.
G.Calculate 8% simple  interest* on the individual payments made by Miss D which were  
considered as part of A, calculated from the date Miss D originally made the payments, to 
the date the complaint is settled.
H.If it chooses  to, use the total of A plus B to repay any unpaid principal on loans 27 to 29.
I.Pay any remaining refund to Miss D.
J.Remove any information  it has recorded on Miss Ds credit file in relation to loans 6 to 29.
*HM Revenue & Customs requires  Sunny  to deduct  tax from this interest. Sunny must give Miss D a 
certificate showing  how much tax it has deducted,  if she asks for one.
my provisional  decision
For the reasons  explained above I intend to uphold  Miss Ds complaint and direct Elevate Credit  
International Limited to take the actions outlined  in the putting things right  section of this decision.
I now invite  both parties to the complaint to comment on my provisional findings  and make any further 
submissions they wish me to consider,  before 23 April 2019. I will then review the case  again.
