The complaint
Ms B complains about PayPal (Europe) Sarl et Cie SCA and the service she received after 
she cancelled a payment intended for a family member.
What happened
On 14 March 2021, Ms B attempted to transfer £100 to a family member through her PayPal 
account as an Instant Transfer. But shortly after this, Ms B realised the e-mail address shed 
attempted to send the money too was incorrect. So, she cancelled this transaction. PayPal 
recognised this cancellation and so paid £100 into Ms Bs account to ensure she had access 
to these funds, as the bank would continue to pay £100 into her PayPal account to attempt 
the cancelled transaction.
On the same day, Ms B attempted to send the same amount again from her PayPal account 
but this time via E-cheque, meaning it would take some time to complete. On 22 March, this 
payment was denied by Ms Bs bank and so, the transfer wasnt completed.
But on 21 April, PayPal received a notification from Ms Bs bank disputing the first cancelled 
transaction and so, Ms Bs bank took £100 from Ms Bs PayPal account to account for this. 
But PayPal felt this had already been refunded to Ms B and so, thought this was a double 
recovery that wasnt permitted under their User Agreement. So, PayPal deducted £100 from 
Ms Bs PayPal balance to counter this, which caused it to go into a negative balance. Ms B 
cleared this negative balance on 6 May. 
But she was unhappy about this and she called PayPal, who told her there was a payment 
processing to her PayPal balance which would bring her account £100 in credit. Ms B says 
because of this information, she spent £100 on her PayPal account with a retailer, who Ill 
refer to as C. But as there we no funds in Ms Bs PayPal account at that time, this £100 
was requested from her bank. And she didnt have sufficient funds to pay for this, so the 
request was denied, and Ms Bs PayPal account was placed back into a negative balance of 
£100. Ms B was unhappy about this, so she raised a complaint.
Ms B was unhappy with the service she received from PayPal. She thought PayPal owed 
her £100 and she didnt think it was fair that they confirmed on a call that this would be paid 
to her, only to change their mind. Ms B explained this issue had impacted her both financially 
and emotionally. And she explained how her mental health had been negatively affected due 
to the calls shed held with PayPal trying to rectify the issue. So, she wanted to be refunded 
the £100 she felt she was owed. And she wanted to be compensated for the upset shed 
been caused.
PayPal responded and upheld Ms Bs complaint. They thought theyd managed Ms Bs 
account and her payment requests appropriately and didnt agree they owed Ms B a further 
refund. But they did accept Ms B was told conflicting information on a call held in May 2021 
and they recognised this information may have led to her spending on her PayPal account. 
So, they paid £100 into Ms Bs account to bring her balance back to £0 to address any 
financial impact shed felt. And they thought this was a fair offer, so didnt think they needed 
to do anything more. Ms B remained unhappy with this response, so she referred her 
complaint to us.
Our investigator looked into the complaint and didnt uphold it. He was satisfied PayPal had 
acted fairly when managing the cancelled transactions and necessary refunds. And he 
thought the £100 PayPal paid Ms B to bring her account back to a £0 balance was 
reasonable to recognise the conflicting information they provided. So, he didnt think PayPal 
needed to do anything more.
Ms B didnt agree. And she didnt think our investigator had considered the upset shed been 
caused on the phone calls she held with PayPal. She explained she suffered with anxiety 
and these calls had caused her to have a panic attack. So, our investigator requested copies 
of these calls to consider.
And having listened to these, our investigator thought PayPal handled the calls fairly and 
didnt think their conduct was unreasonable. So, he didnt think PayPal needed to do 
anything more.
Ms B didnt agree, and she was unhappy with the weight our investigator place on her 
mental health struggles and the impact on this during the calls. She maintained PayPal 
acted unfairly and that she would be refunded £100 plus compensated for the upset shed 
been caused. As Ms B didnt agree, the complaint has been passed to me for a decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im not upholding the complaint for broadly the same reasons as the 
investigator. Ive focused my comments on what I think is relevant. If I havent commented 
on any specific point, its because I dont believe its affected what I think is the right 
outcome.
First, I want to recognise the impact this complaint has had on Ms B. I recognise PayPal 
dont dispute Ms B has been given conflicting information. So, I think its reasonably clear 
this miscommunication has created some confusion for Ms B as to whether she has been 
left out of pocket. And I appreciate the anxiety and upset this wouldve caused Ms B, due to 
the amount of time shes spent speaking to PayPal trying to rectify the issue.
But for me to say PayPal should offer Ms B something more than the £100 theyve already 
offered, Id need to be satisfied they failed to manage Ms Bs account properly, and that an 
error theyve made has left Ms B being owed £100. Or, that the £100 credit to Ms Bs 
account to recognise their error when communicating with Ms B wasnt enough to recognise 
the upset shes been caused. And in this situation, I dont think thats the case.
Ive first thought about the transactions Ms B made and considered whether I think PayPals 
actions refunded Ms B correctly to ensure she wasnt left at a financial loss.
I can see the first transaction for £100 was sent through PayPal as an Instant Transfer. 
PayPal have confirmed when a transaction is processed using this method, the £100 is 
automatically taken from Ms Bs bank account. So, even though Ms B cancelled the 
transaction less than hour after she made it, the £100 would always be debited from Ms Bs 
bank account. So, to ensure Ms B wasnt without these funds, PayPal refunded the £100 into 
Ms Bs bank account straight away. Ive seen evidence that shows the way PayPal managed 
Ms Bs account while processing this transaction left her with a £0 balance, which is what Id 
expect as she cancelled the transaction. So, I cant say they did anything wrong here.Ive then turned to the second transaction Ms B made, on the same day. This transaction 
was processed by E-cheque, which PayPal have explained acts as an electronic cheque. 
So, before they made the funds available to Ms Bs payment recipient, they waited for Ms 
Bs bank to clear the E-cheque. And Ive seen system notes that show Ms Bs bank denied 
this request for funds. So, the £100 was never sent to Ms Bs intended recipient and Ms Bs 
PayPal balance reverted to £0, which is again what Id expect. So, I cant say that PayPal 
have done anything wrong here.
From the notes Ive seen, on 21 April Ms Bs bank then attempted to reclaim the value of the 
first transaction from PayPal. And by claiming this £100, Ms B actually received an additional 
£100 into her account, as PayPal had already refunded this in March 2021. Ive seen 
PayPals user agreement which makes it clear a double recovery isnt permitted. And I think 
this situation classed as a double recovery, as Ms B received a refund of the £100 twice. So, 
to counter this, PayPal deducted £100 from Ms Bs PayPal balance which I think was fair for 
them to do. I can see Ms B then paid £100 into the account to bring the account out of a 
negative balance which was her own decision to make. But I dont think the balance was in a 
minus because of an error PayPal made. So, Im satisfied PayPal managed Ms Bs account 
correctly when processed the transactions and their cancellations and so, I dont think they 
need to do anything more for this aspect of the complaint.
I recognise Ms B is unlikely to agree with this and I appreciate Ms B says her bank 
statements show shes been left without £100. But crucially, I havent seen these 
statements. And Im satisfied Ms B was aware she could provide these to our service for 
consideration and hasnt done so. So, my decision is based on the evidence I have available 
to me.
But Im aware PayPal have accepted they gave Ms B incorrect information on a call in May, 
where she was told £100 was being processed into her account. And it wasnt. Ms B has 
explained she made a purchase with C on the basis that this £100 was going into her 
account and would cover this. As it didnt, Ms B didnt have the funds in her bank account to 
cover this payment. So, as PayPal had already sent the money to C, they placed her 
account in a negative balance again. I think its reasonable for me to assume Ms B made the 
purchase with C based on the information PayPal gave her, so I think she ended up in a 
negative balance unfairly, because of misinformation shed been given.
PayPal have recognised this and re-credited Ms Bs account £100, taking it back to a £0 
balance. So, I think PayPal have compensated Ms B for their error as they ensured Ms B 
wasnt at a financial disadvantage because of the advice they provided.
I recognise Ms B doesnt think this offer is enough, due to the impact this issue had on her 
mental health. Ive listened to the calls between Ms B and PayPal as Ms B was unhappy with 
the way she was spoken to and she felt this evidence the panic attacks she was caused. 
And I dont dispute Ms B found dealing with PayPal difficult as its clear some confusion was 
apparent. But I think PayPal handled these calls politely and courteously and I havent heard 
anything to suggest Ms B was caused additional upset by the way those calls were 
managed.
Instead, I think the upset was caused by the original confusion around how the transactions 
were processed. And as Ive explained above, I dont think PayPal did anything wrong here. 
So, while I dont dispute the upset Ms B has been caused by the issue and the confusion 
surrounding the transactions, I think the £100 PayPal have already applied to the account is 
a fair offer. Because of this, I dont think they need to do anything more on this occasion. My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, I dont uphold Ms Bs complaint about PayPal (Europe) Sarl 
et Cie SCA.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms B to accept or 
reject my decision before 6 April 2022.
