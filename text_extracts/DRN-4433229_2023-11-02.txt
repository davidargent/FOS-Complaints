The complaint
Ms M complains that PrePay Technologies Limited didnt do enough to prevent the loss she
suffered when she sent money to one of their customers as the result of a scam.
What happened
The detailed background to this complaint is well known to both parties. So, Ill only provide
a brief overview of some of the key events here. In December 2021 Ms M was sadly the
victim of a scam. She received a message from someone pretending to be her daughter and
she was tricked into sending a payment for £1,250.25 from her bank account with V to an
account held with PrePay. At the time, Ms M believed this was to help pay for her daughters
rent.
When Ms M realised shed been the victim of a scam she reported this to V. Ms M later
complained to both V and PrePay. A complaint about V has already been considered by our
service. This complaint wasnt upheld as our Investigator concluded the payment wasnt so
unusual that V ought to have done more before processing it. Another one of our
Investigators upheld the complaint about PrePay. She recommended that PrePay provide a
full refund plus interest. Ms M accepted this outcome but PrePay didnt. They asked for an
Ombudsman to make a decision.
In October 2023 I issued a provisional decision in which I said:
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, Im intending to reach a different outcome to that of our Investigator. So, Im
issuing this provisional decision to give everyone a further opportunity to comment before
finalising my decision.
Im sorry to hear Ms M lost money to a cruel scam. But despite my natural sympathy, this
doesnt automatically entitle her to a refund from the business that received the payment. It
would only be fair and reasonable for me to require PrePay to refund Ms Ms outstanding 
loss if they were responsible for acts or omissions which caused it. I dont think they are, and
Ill explain why.
Firstly, I agree with our Investigator that I dont think there were any failings by PrePay when
opening the account. I can see they took correct documentation and conducted appropriate
checks before opening the account. I dont think they reasonably could have known at the
time that the account would go on to receive funds as the result of a scam. So, I dont think
PrePay could have prevented Ms Ms loss in relation to their opening of the account.
The account that received Ms Ms funds had only recently been opened. Below is a timeline
of some of the activity on that account.

2.27pm 3 December 2021 £1,250 debit Outgoing payment to R.
3.41pm 3 December PrePay say they receive an 
email from V about Ms Ms 
payment being as a result of 
a scam.
4.58pm 3 December 2021 PrePay block the account.
Broadly speaking PrePay have done as Id expect in these circumstances for a business of
their size and with their resources. There is a balance to be struck between being alert to
potential fraud and scams and allowing customers to freely use their accounts. And I dont
think PrePay not blocking the account sooner than they did was unreasonable.
I acknowledge that payments arriving and being promptly spent is potentially indicative of an
account being abused. But in the circumstances of this particular account, I think as an initial
step PrePay flagging the activity for a review and not blocking the account wasnt an
unreasonable course of action. This is in the context of the sums involved and the speed
with which the outgoing payments were being made. I just dont think there was enough
going on at that time, where expecting PrePay to have blocked the account was a
reasonable expectation.
Its unclear whether the decision to block the account came about as a result of the manual
review or whether it was due to PrePay seeing the email from V. But in either case, and for
either reason, I dont think the account ought to have been blocked prior to 2.27pm (which is
what would have been required to have made a difference to the loss suffered by Ms M).
This would have required PrePay to conduct their manual review in under 40 minutes from
the time their system flagged the account. And Im not persuaded the review not happening
within that time period is outside of PrePays process (which is to do so within 24 hours). For
completeness, I dont think the activity that occurred after the account had flagged means it
should have been blocked sooner either  the account was pending a manual review at that 
time. And the further payments werent suspicious enough to have warranted a further
trigger which may have resulted in a potential account block / freeze.
Evidently, the above table also shows that Ms Ms money had already left the account by the
time PrePay were notified of the problem by V. So, Im satisfied PrePay couldnt have
retrieved Ms Ms funds from their customers account upon receipt of notification.
Again, Im sorry Ms M has lost money to a scam. But as I dont think PrePay acted
unreasonably in such a way that this loss could have been prevented, Im not intending to
direct them to do more to resolve this complaint.
PrePay responded and said they had nothing further to add. Ms M responded with some 
comments that Ill address below. What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I can quite understand why Ms M thinks PrePay could have acted more swiftly, robustly and 
/ or taken delaying action on an account that had already triggered their suspicious activity 
process. And Ive considered her submissions on this point. But as I mentioned above, 
there is a balance to be struck between following payment instructions promptly and being 
alert to potential fraud and scams. In the circumstances of this case, I dont think there was 
enough at that time where Id reasonably have expected PrePay to have delayed or stopped 
their customers ability to make payments such that it would have made a difference to 
Ms Ms loss. 
Ms M has also raised several further points and has also asked questions. Ill address these 
where I can, but I think it would be helpful to point out that our service investigates individual 
complaints. We arent here to regulate financial businesses which is the role of the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA). Accordingly, I can only comment in relation to Ms Ms complaint, 
not upon wider issues. 
Ms M has questioned whether PrePay completed its manual review. She has also asked 
about any investigation into the setting up of the account and whether PrePay have reported 
matters to other financial institutions / Action Fraud. And whether PrePay were aspiring to 
follow the Contingent Reimbursement Model Code? She also said that PrePay should follow 
the money trail to detect, prevent and deter fraudsters. 
The actions PrePay took (in relation to their accountholder) following Ms Ms funds being 
spent dont impact the loss she suffered and so arent something I can comment on in detail. 
And whilst I understand the points Ms M is making, PrePay arent expected to investigate 
crime, that is the role of the police. Im confident that as a regulated business, PrePay will 
co-operate with any police investigation upon a request for them to do so. Im also satisfied 
that it wasnt reasonable to have expected PrePay to have done more to look into the 
payments being made to R at the time, these simply werent so unusual or suspicious that I 
think that is a reasonable expectation. 
Ms M has questioned whether PrePay are regulated by the FCA and has asked how many 
complaints we receive about them. If PrePay werent regulated, then our service wouldnt be 
able to investigate a complaint about them as it is one of the requirements of our jurisdiction. 
And each complaint is considered on its own individual merits, so the number of other 
complaints received doesnt impact the outcome of this one. 
Ms M also says that she doesnt think businesses like PrePay are doing enough to prevent 
fraud and unless they are held financially culpable, they wont change. I accept that Ms M 
wasnt to blame and that fraud and scams are sadly increasingly common. But Im satisfied 
PrePay acted appropriately in the circumstances of this complaint. And Im unable to 
comment on the wider situation as this is the regulators role. 
Ms M points out that the complaint response she received said that PrePay immediately took 
steps to prevent their customer from using their account. But she says the reality is that this 
took one hour and 17 minutes from the email received from V. Which she considers to be a 
stretch of the word immediately. She also questions the delay between her speaking to V at 
3pm and the email being received by PrePay. I cant comment on the actions of V in this 
decision. But if Ms M accepts she spoke to V at 3pm, then by that time her money had already been spent from the PrePay account (at 2.27pm). So even if both V and PrePay 
could have acted instantly, this wouldnt have made a difference. And whilst I understand 
Ms Ms point about the word immediately, I think this most likely refers to when the email 
was actioned, rather than when it was received. 
Again, Im sorry Ms M has lost money to scammers, and Ive considered all shes said in 
response to my provisional decision. But overall, and whilst I understand this will be 
disappointing for her, Im not persuaded to deviate from the outcome Ive previously 
explained. 
My final decision
For the reasons outlined above, my final decision is that I dont uphold this complaint. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms M to accept or 
reject my decision before 30 November 2023.
