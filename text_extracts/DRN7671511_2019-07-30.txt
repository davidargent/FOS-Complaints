K820x#14complaint
Miss P says Barclays Bank UK PLC (trading as Barclaycard) mis-sold her a payment 
protection insurance (PPI) policy. 
background
Miss P bought  the policy  in 2001  at the same time as taking  out a credit  card.  
Our adjudicator didnt  uphold the complaint. Miss P disagreed with the adjudicators  opinion  
so the complaint has been passed to me.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about the sale of PPI on our website and 
Ive taken this into account in deciding  Miss Ps case.
Ive decided not to uphold  Miss Ps complaint because:
 I think  Barclaycard made  Miss P aware that the PPI was optional  and that she chose 
to take it. I say this because she did tick the box on the credit card application form to 
show that she wanted the cover.
 Barclaycard didnt recommend the PPI to Miss P so it didnt have to check if it was 
suitable for her. Miss P had to decide  for herself whether  the policy was suitable for her 
needs.
 Its possible the information Barclaycard gave Miss P about the PPI wasnt  as clear  as 
it should have  been. But its unlikely Miss P would have been affected by any of the 
main things  the policy didnt cover. And the policy was competitively priced and had a 
reasonable benefit. So I dont  think better  information wouldve stopped her buying it. 
my final decision
My decision  is that I do not uphold  this complaint.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Miss P to accept 
or reject my decision before 30 August 2019.
