The complaint
Mr B complains that NewDay Ltd trading as Amazon Platinum Credit Card did not process a 
Credit Balance Refund (CBR) in line with the timeframes they gave him.
What happened
Mr B accidently made a payment to his NewDay account, so he rang NewDay on 13 October 
2022 to ask them to process a CBR for him. He says he was told that this would take 7-10 
working days. Mr B didnt receive the funds by 26 October 2022, so he rang NewDay again, 
who informed him that if he didnt receive the refund by midnight the following day to ring 
them. Mr B says he tried to ring NewDay twice on 28 October, but he was disconnected after 
1 hour and 18 minutes each time. This happened the following day also when he tried to ring 
them again. 
Mr B managed to get through to NewDay on 31 October 2022, after again being on hold for 
over an hour, as he still hadnt received the refund. He made a complaint to NewDay on this 
call also. He says he was told again the CBR would take 7-10 working days but he received 
this on 2 November 2022. NewDay upheld Mr Bs complaint. They paid him £25 
compensation due to the long hold times and the trouble they had caused him. Mr B brought 
his complaint to our service. 
Our investigator upheld Mr Bs complaint. He said Mr B experienced inconvenience with 
excessive call times and a delay with receiving a CBR. He said NewDay should pay Mr B an 
extra £25 to total £50 compensation. Mr B asked for an ombudsman to review his complaint 
as he did not believe the compensation was high enough as it didnt even cover the 
minimum wage with the amount of time he spent on the phone to NewDay.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
When Mr B contacted NewDay originally, he was told that the CBR would take 7-10 working 
days. This should have meant that Mr B received the funds by 27 October 2022. But Mr B 
did not receive the funds by this date. This meant Mr B was inconvenienced by having to 
contact NewDay to find out where his refund was. It was four working days after this date 
when he received the CBR.
Ive looked at the evidence that Mr B has given us regarding how much time hes spent on 
the phone on this issue. So I can understand his frustration at what happened here. NewDay 
have said that he could have used their online digital chat which would have avoided him 
being on hold, and while that may be correct, I would still expect NewDay to be able to deal 
with Mr Bs query with whatever channel they make available to him.
Mr B did spend over an hour of the time on hold to NewDay before the 10 working days had 
expired. So there were actions he could have also taken to mitigate the impact of what 
happened here as he did not need to ring them until the timeframe had passed. The phone 
records show a call in January also, which is after he received the CBR and after NewDays 
response to his complaint. 
It would generally be expected that there could be times where a customer may have to hold 
during busy periods for businesses. But some of the time that Mr B was on hold for would be 
considered excessive. So its only fair that Mr B is compensated for the inconvenience he 
had having to contact NewDay after he hadnt received the CBR within the timeframe they 
told him.
Im not persuaded that the £25 recognises the impact this had on Mr B. I need to be clear to 
Mr B that we dont link our awards to minimum wages or earnings. Our awards are not 
designed to punish a business. While there may have been measures he could have taken 
which could have mitigated some of the impact on him which Ive previously mentioned, he 
still had to get in contact with NewDay when he didnt receive the CBR. So I agree with our 
investigator that the total of the compensation should be doubled to £50, which is in line with 
our awards for what happened here, so it follows Ill be asking NewDay to put things right for 
Mr B.
Putting things right
Our investigator suggested that NewDay pays Mr B an extra £25 to total £50 compensation, 
which I think is reasonable in the circumstances.
My final decision
I uphold this complaint. NewDay Ltd trading as Amazon Platinum Credit Card should pay Mr 
B an extra £25 to total £50 compensation.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr B to accept or 
reject my decision before 20 October 2023.
