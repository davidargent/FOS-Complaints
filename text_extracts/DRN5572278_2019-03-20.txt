K820x#14complaint
Mr and Ms G say HSBC Bank  Plc (HSBC) mis-sold a Plus packaged bank account to them  
in 2006. Theyve  used  a Claims Management  Company  (CMC)  to complain. 
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr and Ms Gs complaint  already and didnt think that HSBC mis-
sold the packaged account.  The CMC  disagreed  and asked for an ombudsmans  review.  
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr and Ms Gs complaint.  Having done so, I dont think HSBC mis-sold the 
Plus account  to Mr and Ms G. Id like to explain why I think thats the case.  
Its common knowledge that free accounts are widely available in the United Kingdom. And 
Mr and Ms G having one before the Plus account means they wouldve known HSBC  did 
free accounts and that they couldve had one of those if thats what  they really  wanted.
The Plus account  wasnt recommended  to Mr and Ms G. So it was up to Mr and Ms G to 
decide if it was right for them.  I think that Mr and Ms G couldve used some the main  benefits 
included on the account and it was up to them to do so. 
Im open  to the possibility Mr and Ms G werent told everything they needed  to know about 
all the benefits.  But Ive not seen  anything suggesting the main limitations or exclusions 
affected them. So I dont  think  clearer  information  wouldve made  a difference  and I think    
Mr and Ms G were  given enough  to know and understand what  they were  choosing to take. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr and Ms Gs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr and Ms G to 
accept or reject my decision  before  20 April 2019.
