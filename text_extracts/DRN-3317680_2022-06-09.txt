The complaint
Mr G complains that Mitsubishi HC Capital UK plc wont refund to him the money that he 
paid for a holiday club membership. Hes being represented by a professional adviser.
What happened
Mr G and his wife entered into a vacation membership agreement to buy a holiday club 
membership from a timeshare company in February 2014. The total price of the membership 
was £10,400 and Mr G used a fixed sum loan agreement with (what is now) Mitsubishi 
Capital that he signed in February 2014 to pay for it. He agreed to repay the loan by 84 
monthly instalments of £254.59. 
A claim was made to Mitsubishi Capital in November 2016 that there was an unfair 
relationship between Mr G and Mitsubishi Capital and that Mr G was entitled to damages 
and compensation under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. His representative 
said that the timeshare company didnt conduct a proper assessment of Mr Gs financial 
position and ability to repay the loan and applied considerable pressure to procure his 
agreement to the loan and breached EU Law. 
Mitsubishi Capital said that appropriate affordability checks were completed by conducting a 
credit reference search and Mr G confirmed that he was a homeowner with no mortgage 
earning between £15,000 and £19,999 per year and that the checks indicated that he was 
able to maintain the monthly repayment. It said that Mr G hadnt contacted it to advise of any 
financial difficulty in maintaining the loan. It denied that Mr G was unfairly pressurised into 
the loan and said that it was confident that the relationship with Mr G wasnt unfair. Mr G 
wasnt satisfied with its response so a complaint was made to this service about those 
issues and about the commission that was paid by Mitsubishi Capital to the timeshare 
company.
Our investigator didnt recommend that this complaint should be upheld. He said that he 
hadnt seen anything that would suggest that the lending was unaffordable or enough 
evidence to conclude that Mr G was unfairly pressurised into the purchase. He didnt think 
that this service could consider the complaint about any commission payment as that hadnt 
been raised as part of the complaint when the section 140A claim was made to Mitsubishi 
Capital.
Mr Gs representative, on his behalf, says that it doesnt agree with our investigators 
recommendation and wants this matter to be considered by an ombudsman.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the outcome recommended by our investigator for these 
reasons:
Mr Gs complaint is about Mitsubishi Capitals response to his claim under section 
140A for a refund of the money that hes paid for the timeshare (and other 
compensation) and his representative says that the timeshare company didnt 
conduct a proper assessment of Mr Gs financial position and ability to repay the 
loan, applied considerable pressure to procure his agreement to the loan, breached 
EU Law and that an undeclared commission was paid by Mitsubishi Capital to the 
timeshare company;
the claim that was made to Mitsubishi Capital by Mr Gs representative didnt include 
a complaint about an undeclared commission so Im unable to consider that as part 
of this complaint  if Mr G wants to complain about an undeclared commission he 
should first make a complaint about it to Mitsubishi Capital and then, if hes not 
satisfied with its response, he may be able to make a complaint to this service;
although Im unable to make a finding on that issue, from what this service has seen 
across the industry, if commission was ever paid it tended to be low and of less than 
10% and I consider it to be unlikely that: Mitsubishi Capital would have breached any 
duty if it made such a payment; that it would have been under any regulatory duty to 
disclose the amount of commission that was paid; or that the level of commission that 
was paid was sufficiently high to mean that Mitsubishi Capital should have 
appreciated that not disclosing any commission to Mr G risked the relationship being 
unfair under section 140A;
section 140A gives a court the power, amongst other things, to require a creditor to 
repay any sum paid by the debtor under a credit agreement if it determines that 
theres an unfair relationship between the debtor and the creditor  but Im not 
persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the relationship between Mr G 
and Mitsubishi Capital was unfair in these circumstances and I dont consider it to be 
likely that a court would conclude that the relationship was unfair;
Mr Gs representative has described the way that the timeshare was sold to Mr G 
and his wife but Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that they 
were unduly pressurised into entering into the vacation membership agreement or 
the fixed sum loan agreement, or that the timeshare company used unacceptable 
commercial practices against them  Mr G didnt complain to Mitsubishi Capital about 
the way that the timeshare had been sold to them until about two and a half years 
later and I understand that Mr G bought another timeshare from the timeshare 
company in December 2014 and I dont consider it to be likely that he would have 
done so if hed been unfairly pressurised into buying this timeshare in February 2014;
Mr G and his wife signed the vacation membership agreement and Ive seen no 
evidence to show that they tried to withdraw from that agreement or that they 
complained to either the timeshare company or Mitsubishi Capital about the 
agreement until November 2016, about two and a half years after theyd bought the 
timeshare;
Mitsubishi Capital says that appropriate affordability checks were completed by 
conducting a credit reference search and that Mr G confirmed that he was a 
homeowner with no mortgage earning between £15,000 and £19,999 per year  it 
says that the checks indicated that he was able to maintain the monthly loan 
repayment  which was £254.59  and that he hadnt contacted it to advise of any 
financial difficulty in maintaining the loan repayments;
Im not persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the loan agreement was 
unaffordable for Mr G or that the timeshare company didnt assess his financial 
position and ability to repay the loan before the loan was made to him;nor am I persuaded that theres enough evidence to show that the timeshare 
company has failed to comply with any legal requirements in these circumstances;
I consider that Mitsubishi Capitals response to Mr Gs section 140A claim was fair 
and reasonable; and
I sympathise with Mr G for the issues that he and his wife have had with the 
timeshare and the difficulties that hes described, but I find that it wouldnt be fair or 
reasonable for me to require Mitsubishi Capital to refund to Mr G any of the 
payments that hes made under the loan agreement, to pay him any compensation or 
to take any other action in response to his complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Mr Gs complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mr G to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 July 2022.
