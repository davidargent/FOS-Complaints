DRN-4291520
The complaint
Mrs S has complained that, after she made purchases, NewDay Ltd applied them to the 
wrong choice of repayment option.
What happened
Mrs S has complained that three items she bought, using finance from NewDay, were 
bought on buy now, pay later (BNPL). But, NewDay has treated these purchases as being 
on its standard credit terms, so has applied interest.
One of our investigators looked into what had happened. But, he wasnt persuaded that Mrs 
S had bought the items on BNPL. This was because Mrs S had no evidence to show she 
had. On the other hand, NewDay had sent her statements for over a year, for each of the 
three disputed items, showing the applicable interest. Mrs S has explained she didnt read 
these.
Mrs S also said that NewDay agreed for no repayments to be made, while it looked into 
things. Our investigator disagreed, as NewDay had consistently sent letters requesting 
payment.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
I know this will be upsetting, but I agree with NewDay. Theres no evidence the three items 
were bought on BNPL. I accept that Mrs S didnt look at her statements. But that doesnt 
mean they werent sent, or received. 
I would urge Mrs S to contact NewDay if shes experiencing financial difficulty, if she feels 
that would be useful. Id expect NewDay to react appropriately, according to industry 
standards.
My final decision
For the reasons given above, its my final decision not to uphold this complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Mrs S to accept or 
reject my decision before 1 January 2024.
