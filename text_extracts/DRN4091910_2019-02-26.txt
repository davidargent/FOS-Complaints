K820x#14complaint
Mr R says TSB Bank  plc (TSB)  mis-sold  him a Silver packaged  bank account in 2012. Hes 
used a Claims Management Company (CMC) to make his complaint.
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr Rs complaint and didnt think  TSB had mis-sold  the account.  
The CMC disagreed and asked  for an ombudsmans decision. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Rs complaint. 
Having carefully looked  at everything  provided,  Im not upholding Mr Rs complaint. Id like to 
explain the reasons  for my decision. I think Mr R chose to take the account as hed had a 
free account  previously. He appears  to have had an identifiable need for the main benefits  
and he couldve used  them too. 
So overall I dont  think that clearer information wouldve changed Mr Rs decision to accept 
what looks to have  been a fair recommendation made by TSB. And, in these circumstances, 
Im not upholding the complaint. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Rs complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr R to accept or 
reject my decision  before 26 March  2019.
