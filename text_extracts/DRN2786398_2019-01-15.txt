K821x#15complaint
Mr C is unhappy with the offer of compensation made to him by Allianz Insurance  Plc 
(trading as M&S Bank) following a complaint about  payment protection  insurance (PPI).
background
I issued a provisional decision in June 2018 to explain  why I thought  Mr Cs complaint should 
be upheld. And I said Id consider anything else anyone wanted to give me. This is an extract 
from that provisional decision.
Mr C had a charge-card  account with M&S which had PPI attached. The account was
opened in March 1988 and closed in May 2005.
In 2017, Mr C made a complaint about  the sale of the policy  attached to his charge-card  
and in September 2017, M&S made  an offer to settle Mr Cs complaint.
M&S said PPI was added to Mr Cs account  when it opened in 1988. But the earliest 
available statement it had, showing a PPI premium, was from June 2000. And Mr C didnt 
use his account  after March 2001. So, M&S  had very little information  available to it to 
calculate Mr Cs offer.
So M&S offered  to refund Mr C the premiums  he had paid from June 2000 onwards, the 
interest hed been  charged on those premiums and 8% simple interest per year for the 
amount of time hed been out of pocket. And it used the information it did have, from 2000  
onwards, to make some  assumptions about  what it thought Mr C wouldve paid in PPI 
premiums and interest between March  1988 and May 2000.
M&Ss offer amounted to £127.05. This included a refund of PPI premiums amounting to
£43.34, interest  charged on those premiums of £61.55 and 15% simple interest prior to
1993, 8% thereafter,  amounting to £27.70 (before tax).
Mr C wasnt happy with the offer. He thinks he paid more in PPI than M&S has offered to 
refund to him. He says it isnt fair for M&S to use the information it has from June 2000 
onwards to work out what he wouldve  paid in PPI premiums between June 1988 and
May 2000. He says he wasnt using his account very much from June 2000 onwards so his 
balances and PPI charges wouldve been  much lower from this point. And this isnt reflective 
of how he was using his card between 1988 and 2000, when he used it much  more.
Mr C also provided us with some information  that he received from M&S following a subject 
access request. This included a screenshot of M&Ss internal systems  showing that the total 
value of the purchases Mr C made  on his charge-card amounted to £16,436. Mr C says this 
shows how much  he was spending on his card for the period M&S  doesnt have data for and 
M&S should use this amount to work  out his offer.
M&S thinks its current offer is fair. Our adjudicator also looked at the complaint and thought 
M&Ss offer was fair. Mr C disagreed. So the complaint has been passed to me for a final 
decision.
Ref: DRN27863982my provisional findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
M&S has already  agreed to settle  the complaint so I wont be looking into how the PPI came 
to be sold to Mr C. I will only be looking at whether the amount of compensation M&S  has 
offered to resolve the complaint is fair.
In summary, I think M&S should  do more  when calculating  Mr Cs offer of compensation. Ill 
explain why.
When a business  agrees  to settle  a PPI complaint, we expect it to, as far as possible,  put 
the consumer  in the position they wouldve been in had they not taken out the PPI policy.
I accept that this is difficult in this case because of the very limited information available.  But 
I would expect M&S  to look at all the information  it has to make some assumptions  about 
what Mr C mightve  been charged  for PPI between 1988 and 2000.
In this case, M&S has used the information it holds  from 2000 onward to make  assumptions 
about what it thinks Mr C wouldve paid in PPI premiums  and interest between  March 1988 
and May 2000.  But M&S has more  information  available to it that it can use to complete  a 
more accurate calculation. So I think M&S can do more.
Mr C received information from M&S that said the total value of the purchases he made on 
his charge-card amounted  to £16,436. Having looked at the statements available,  I can see 
that some of these purchases were made after June 2000. But it seems to me that the 
majority wouldve been made before  June 2000  as Mr C wasnt using his card very much 
from June 2000  onwards.  So it seems  to me that Mr C was using his charge-card 
significantly more prior to June 2000. So I think M&S needs to use this figure in its 
calculations.
I say this because PPI premiums wouldve been charged as a percentage of Mr Cs 
outstanding balance. So the more  Mr C spent  on and used his charge-card,  the higher his 
PPI premiums are likely to have been. And I think the total value of the purchases is a good 
indication of how much  Mr C spent on his card during the period M&S doesnt  have  records 
for. So I dont  think it would be fair for M&S  to ignore this information  and rely solely  on the 
information it has about Mr Cs PPI charges post 2000. So I think M&S should  recalculate 
Mr Cs offer of compensation taking into account  the total value of the purchases he made  
on the account.
I dont think it would be fair to assume that Mr Cs balance  steadily increased from 0 to the 
earliest known statement  date. This is because we know that Mr C was using his account 
much more prior to June 2000 and this account  is a charge-card account   meaning Mr C 
wouldve had to pay his balance off every month.  So I think M&S should assume that Mr C 
had a consistent balance on his account prior to June 2000.  And M&S can work this out by 
dividing the total purchases made before January 2000 by the number of months between 
March 1988 and January 2000.
putting things right
Ref: DRN27863983So, unless M&S or Mr C can give me more accurate information, such as more  statements, 
then I think  M&S should calculate  Mr Cs offer again.  So M&S should:
Work  out the average amount Mr C purchased  each month  by dividing the total 
purchases made before January 2000  by the number of months  between  
March 1988 and January 2000.
Assume Mr Cs balance was the average amount he purchased each month and use 
this to refund the monthly premium hed have  been  charged  using the PPI cost per 
£100.
Add simple interest on each premium for the amount of time Mr C has been  out of 
pocket. This should be at a rate of 8% per year simple on each  payment (15%  on 
payments before  April 1993).  M&S has to take basic rate tax off this interest. Mr C 
can claim back the tax if he doesnt  pay tax
Reconstruct the account using the statement  data it has from June 2000 onwards
For the reasons  above, at present I dont  think the offer Allianz  Insurance  Plc (trading as 
M&S Bank) has made to resolve Mr Cs complaint is fair. So I think  it needs to calculate 
Mr Cs offer again taking into account  what Ive said above.
I would ask Allianz Insurance  Plc (trading  as M&S  Bank)  to provide a new calculation
along the lines Ive indicated in response to this provisional decision.
my findings
Ive re-considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Its pleasing  to see that Allianz (trading as M&S  Bank) has agreed  with my provisional 
decision and recalculated Mr Cs offer of compensation.  This updated  offer amounts to 
£389.44. 
One of our adjudicators put the updated  offer to Mr Cs representatives and they told us they 
werent sure it had been calculated in the way I had set out in my provisional decision.  Ive 
now had the opportunity to review a breakdown of how the offer has been calculated,  and I 
think it has been calculated in the way I suggested. Ill explain why.
M&S has worked out that the total value  of purchases made on Mr Cs charge-card prior to 
June 2000 amounts to £15,735.63. 
In my provisional decision I asked M&S to divide the total value of the purchases made prior 
to June 2000 by the amount of months it didnt have data for. So M&S has divided the total 
value of the purchases made (£15,735.63) by the number of months it is missing data for 
(146) to work out what Mr Cs average balance wouldve been between 1988  and 2000.  
Essentially its assumed  Mr Cs purchases of £15,735.63 were spread out evenly over the 
period it doesnt  have  data for. So, M&S has worked out Mr C wouldve had an average 
monthly balance  of £107.78.  
M&S has then worked out the PPI premiums that a balance of £107.78 wouldve attracted.
M&S has done this by using what it does know about Mr Cs account.  Its told us that during 
the period it doesnt have data for, PPI charges amounted to 67p per £100 of outstanding 
Ref: DRN27863984balance each month. So a balance of £107.78  wouldve attracted a PPI premium  of 72p 
each month. In its updated  offer, M&S  has included 146 monthly PPI premium  charges of 
72p totalling £105.43. 
Mr Cs offer relates to a charge-card so Mr C wouldve been expected to pay off his balance  
each month. This means Mr Cs monthly balance  wouldnt have attracted interest. But it also 
means Mr C paid 72p a month more than he should have done. This is because he wouldve  
had to pay for his purchases each month plus his monthly PPI premium. So M&S has added 
simple interest to the cost of each premium, from the date it was paid, to compensate Mr C 
for the amount of time he has been without  this money. This is calculated at a rate of 15% 
per year simple on PPI premiums paid before April 1993, 8% per year simple on premiums  
paid after. This amounts  to £205.51.
M&S has then reconstructed Mr Cs charge-card account using the statement data it 
does have from June  2000 onwards to calculate  Mr Cs overall offer. 
In total, Mr C is owed £310.94  for the period it doesnt hold data for and £78.50 for the 
period M&S does  have data for. This amounts to a total offer of £389.44.  
So, for the reasons set out above, I think M&S has recalculated Mr Cs offer in the way I 
set out in my provisional decision. And I think this is a fair offer taking into account all of 
the circumstances and the very limited information M&S holds in relation to Mr Cs 
charge-card account. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above,  I direct Allianz Insurance  Plc to update and pay Mr C the 
recalculated offer as soon as possible,  if it hasnt done so already.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr C to accept or 
reject my decision  before 15 February  2019.
