K820x#14complaint
Mr W says HSBC Bank Plc (HSBC) mis-sold a Plus packaged bank account to him in 
2006. Hes used a Claims Management  Company (CMC) to make his complaint. 
background
Our adjudicators looked at Mr Ws complaint  already and didnt think that HSBC mis-sold the 
packaged account. The CMC disagreed and asked for an ombudsmans  review. 
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve explained how we handle 
complaints about  packaged bank accounts  on our website. And Ive used this approach to 
help me decide  Mr Ws complaint. Having done so, I dont think HSBC mis-sold the Plus 
account to Mr W. Id like to explain  why I think thats  the case. 
Its common knowledge that free accounts are widely available in the United Kingdom. So I 
think that Mr W wouldve known HSBC did free accounts and that he couldve had one of 
those if thats what  he really wanted.
I dont think the Plus account  was recommended to Mr W. So it was up to Mr W to decide if 
the Plus account  was right for him. I think that Mr W couldve used some the main benefits 
included on the account and it was up to him to do so. 
Im open  to the possibility Mr W wasnt told absolutely everything he needed  to know about 
all the benefits.  But Ive not seen  anything to suggest he wouldve been  affected by the main 
limitations or exclusions. So I dont think clearer information wouldve made a difference and 
I think Mr W was given enough to know and understand what he was choosing to agree to. 
my final decision
For the reasons  set out above, Im not upholding Mr Ws complaint. 
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  I am required to ask Mr W to accept 
or reject my decision before 11 April 2019.
