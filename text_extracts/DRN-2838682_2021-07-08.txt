The complaint
Miss I complains about the default that PayPal Europe Sarl & Cie, SCA has recorded on her 
credit file.
What happened
Miss I has an account with PayPal which had an outstanding balance. She entered into a 
debt management plan which included the debt that she owed to PayPal. PayPal sent her a 
default notice in November 2019 and then recorded a default on her credit file. Miss I 
complained to PayPal about the default. It said that it had received the debt management 
plan but it wasnt fulfilled so the default notice on her credit file was applied correctly. Miss I 
wasnt satisfied with its response so complained to this service. 
Our investigator didnt recommend that her complaint should be upheld. He said that Miss I 
had provided evidence that showed she made the required payments prior to the default 
being issued. He said that if there hadnt been further issues with her payments, he wouldve 
asked PayPal to remove the default  but Miss I hadnt made the required payments in 
January, February and March 2020 which was a breach of the agreement. PayPal had then 
passed her account to a debt recovery agency in April 2020 and he thought that there was a 
very strong likelihood that PayPal would have defaulted her account at that time if it hadnt 
already done so. 
He said that a default at that time would have been visible until May 2026 but the default that 
it recorded would no longer be visible from January 2026 so asking PayPal to change the 
default date to correctly reflect what happened would have the potential to negatively impact 
Miss I for four extra months. He thought that the fair outcome was that the default placed on 
her credit file in December 2019 remained and that it would be unreasonable to ask PayPal 
to remove it from her credit file.
Miss I has asked for her complaint to be considered by an ombudsman. She has responded 
in detail and says, in summary and amongst other things, that:
whilst PayPal may have issued a default later, theres no specific evidence to show 
that a default would have been recorded on her credit file and shes described what 
might have happened;
its not known what would have happened with any certainty  but it is known that the 
actual default issued in December 2019 was premature because shed made the 
required payments;
PayPal has provided atrocious customer service so she communicated with it 
through her debt management company;
she didnt know that her income would be reduced when she agreed to make the 
repayments, her debt management company was acting on her behalf and was 
made aware that her income was reducing and it was reasonable to assume that it 
passed that information to PayPal; and
the default should be removed from her credit file.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the investigator for these reasons:
Miss I had an account with PayPal which was in arrears in September 2019 and 
shed entered into a debt management plan with a debt management company under 
which shed offered to make monthly repayments of £71.17 to PayPal;
her debt management company made payments to PayPal on her behalf of £68.10 in 
September 2019, £71.17 in October 2019 and £71.17 in November 2019  but the 
payments were sent to PayPal by cheque and it didnt receive them until December 
2019;
because it hadnt received the payments it was expecting, PayPal issued a default 
notice to Miss I in November 2019  it said that the amount that she owed to it was 
£1,867.31, of which £192.29 was overdue;
it recorded a default on her credit file in December 2019  but it then received the two 
payments of £71.17 from Miss Is debt management company that had been made in 
October and November 2019;
it received another payment of £71.17 from Miss Is debt management company in 
December 2019 but shes provided evidence to show that she changed employment 
in November 2019, was then being paid weekly instead of monthly and wasnt able to 
work for two weeks over the Christmas period so had less pay than she was 
expecting;
although PayPal was expecting to receive monthly payments of £71.17, her schedule 
of payments from the debt management company shows that two payments totalling 
£26.94 were made to PayPal in January 2020, three payments totalling £45.60 were 
made to it in February 2020, four payments totalling £42.40 were made to it in March 
2020 and four payments totalling £37.72 were made to it in April 2020;
if PayPal hadnt already defaulted Miss Is account in December 2019, I consider it to 
be more likely than not that it would have issued a default notice to her in April 2020 
when it hadnt received as much as it was expecting from her for three consecutive 
months;
Miss I has described the income difficulties that she was experiencing and wasnt 
able to make full payments to all of her other creditors so Im not persuaded that 
shed have been able to clear her arrears to PayPal at that time and I consider it to 
be more likely than not that a default would have then been recorded on her credit 
file;
I agree with Miss I that theres no certainty about what wouldve happened if her 
account hadnt been defaulted in December 2019 and Ive carefully considered all of 
what she has said about whether or not a default would have occurred at some point 
after May 2020; 
in complaints like this, where the evidence is incomplete, inconclusive or 
contradictory, I have to make a decision on the balance of probabilities  in other 
words, what I consider is most likely to have happened in light of the available 
evidence and the wider circumstances;
I consider it to be more likely than not that if Miss Is account hadnt been defaulted in 
December 2019, it would have been defaulted at some point after May 2020;the default that was recorded by PayPal on Miss Is credit file will expire after six 
years and will be removed from her credit file in December 2025 but if that default 
was removed and replaced with a default that I consider would have been recorded 
at some point after May 2020, the earliest that it would be removed from Miss Is 
credit file would be May 2026  so Miss I would be adversely impacted by that default 
for longer than she will be adversely impacted by the default that was recorded in 
December 2019;
Ive also considered Miss Is comments about the customer service that shes 
received from PayPal and the other comments that shes made in response to our 
investigators recommendations;
I sympathise with Miss I for the financial difficulties and other issues that shes 
experienced but I consider that PayPal has responded to her financial difficulties 
positively and sympathetically, as its required to do; and
Im not persuaded that it would be fair or reasonable in these circumstances for me to 
require PayPal to remove the default that its recorded on Miss Is credit file, to pay 
her any compensation or to take any other action in response to her complaint.
My final decision
My decision is that I dont uphold Miss Is complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss I to accept or 
reject my decision before 5 August 2021.
