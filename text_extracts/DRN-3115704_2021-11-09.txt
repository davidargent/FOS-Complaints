The complaint
Ms O complained that NewDay Ltd issued a default notice on her account and transferred 
the debt to a recovery agent when they shouldnt have. 
What happened
Ms O held a credit card account with NewDay that was dual branded with an online retailer.
In April 2020, Ms O wanted to purchase an item from the online retailer. She identified two 
identical items and chose to purchase the cheaper one. She paid for it using her NewDay 
credit card. 
Ms O received the item she ordered but then received a notification, from the retailer, that 
the other item would be delivered the following day. As she hadnt ordered that item, she 
contacted the retailer to cancel it. The retailer asked her to return the second item once it 
was received. But the item didnt arrive. 
In May 2020, Ms O paid £45 to her NewDay account to cover the cost of the item shed 
purchased. But the cost of the second item had also been applied to her NewDay account. 
NewDay wrote to Ms O in July and August 2020 as they hadnt received any payments to 
her account and there was a balance outstanding. They also charged late payment fees and 
interest on the amount she owed.
Ms O contacted NewDay to raise a dispute on the second amount that had been paid to the 
online retailer. She told NewDay this amount shouldnt have been taken as shed not 
ordered the item and the online retailer had agreed to refund but hadnt. NewDay refunded 
the money to her account. But there was still a balance owed.
In September 2020, NewDay suspended Ms Os account as they hadnt received any 
payments towards the amount she owed. NewDay issued a default notice in October 2020. 
But Ms O wasnt happy with this. So, she complained to NewDay. She said shed paid off an 
amount to cover the item shed purchased. She didnt think that she owed NewDay anything 
else.
NewDay responded to Ms Os complaint. They didnt think theyd acted unfairly. Ms O 
disagreed with NewDays findings. So, she referred her complaint to this service.
One of our investigators looked at Ms Os complaint. She also didnt agree that NewDay had 
acted unfairly. So, Ms O asked for her complaint to be referred to an ombudsman for a final 
decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Ms Os account statements show two entries to an online retailer on 12 April 2020. One for 
£49.44 and the other for £44.95. Ms O has confirmed that the larger amount shouldnt have 
been taken as she hadnt ordered the item this related to. I also see that a payment of £45 
was made to her account on 12 May 2020. Ms O says that she made this payment to cover 
the purchase she made. 
NewDay charged interest to Ms Os account for the remaining balance owed. Ive looked at 
their credit card agreement. This shows they were entitled to do that as the balance owed 
hadnt been repaid in full. They continued to charge interest while a balance remained 
outstanding.
The statements also show that Ms O didnt make any payments to her account after the £45 
paid in May 2020. NewDays credit card agreement says If you do not make your 
contractual paymentwe will charge a default fee. So, NewDay charged default fees of £12 
on each occasion a payment was missed. I believe they were entitled to do that.
Ms O had contacted NewDay in June 2020 about the disputed transaction. They explained 
she would need raise to this through her online account manager. But it appears she didnt 
do that. It also appears she rang NewDay again on 11 July 2020. NewDay attempted to call 
her back on 12 July, without success. Ms O finally raised the disputed transaction claim with 
NewDay on 12 August 2020. NewDay werent able to do anything before then.
NewDay refunded £49.44 to Ms Os account on 17 August 2020. This still left a balance 
owed, but Ms O didnt make the contracted minimum payments. It appears that the balance 
owed resulted from interest and charges that NewDay had charged and I think they were 
entitled to charge these. 
The overriding issue here is that Ms O chose not to make payments to her NewDay account 
as she believed that the transaction for £49.44 on 12 April 2020 was wrongly claimed. While 
that may be the case, that wasnt NewDays fault. So, at the time, Ms O did owe an amount 
to NewDay. Their credit card agreement does say if you have a dispute with someone 
else over a transaction, you must keep making payments to us while you are resolving it. 
But Ms O chose not to do that here.
Ms Os credit card account is dual branded with the same online retailer through which she 
made her purchase. Ms O believes that NewDay should be held accountable for the mistake 
that the online retailer made when they charged her for two items. So, I think its important to 
clarify this point.
Accepting the dual branding associated with Ms Os account, its important to understand 
that her account is provided by NewDay  not by the retailer. The two businesses are 
distinctly separate. The credit card agreement clearly states, This Agreement is between us, 
NewDay Ltdand you. So, I cant reasonably hold NewDay responsible for any actions 
or mistakes made by the online retailer. They wouldnt have had any control over that. 
Ms Os account statements were available for her to view through NewDays online service. 
And I think the statements were clear there was a balance outstanding and a minimum 
contracted payment needed to be made. The statements also clearly showed any charges 
and interest that were applied to her account. 
I understand that Ms O says she shouldnt bear responsibility for the accrued interest 
suffered as a result of the retailer taking money from my NewDay credit card account when 
they knew they didnt supply the product to me. I do sympathise with Ms Os situation. But I 
dont think I can reasonably hold NewDay accountable for the retailers actions. If she 
remains dissatisfied, she may consider addressing that with the retailer.
Given that Ms O didnt make the contracted payments to her account, I also think that 
NewDay were entitled to take the actions that they did, including passing the outstanding 
debt to a debt recovery agent. I do appreciate that Ms O will be disappointed, but I agree 
with out investigator here. So, I wont be upholding Ms Os complaint.My final decision
For the reasons set out above, I dont uphold Ms Os complaint.
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Ms O to accept or 
reject my decision before 7 December 2021.
