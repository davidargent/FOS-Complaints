K821x#15complaint
Mr J says CashEuroNet UK LLC, trading as QuickQuid, lent to him irresponsibly.
background
I sent Mr J and QuickQuid my provisional decision on 20 February 2019. A copy  of it is 
attached and it forms part of this final decision.  The full background to the complaint is set 
out there.  
I explained why I was planning  to uphold Mr Js complaint in part and asked both parties for 
their comments. Mr J didnt send me anything else to consider. QuickQuid didnt agree with 
my provisional decision. It provided  some new information and made  a number of points, 
including both some  case-specific  comments as well as general information  about its 
processes which  it has previously provided to this service.
Ive considered the points made  by QuickQuid and set out my findings  below.
my findings
Ive considered again all the available evidence and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.  Weve set out our general approach  to 
complaints about  short-term lending on our website and Ive taken this into account in 
deciding Mr Js case.
QuickQuid maintains that it did conduct  appropriate and proportionate affordability 
assessments, including validation of Mr [Js] income  before funding the loans I thought  it 
shouldnt have approved.
To support its position, QuickQuid provided  figures  for what  it calls CRA [Credit Reference  
Agency] Validated Other Credit Commitments. 
QuickQuid also said that should the CRA validated value be less than the customer  
stated value, we always use the HIGHER value to calculate  its estimate of Mr Js 
disposable income.
For loan 2 the CRA figure for Mr Js credit commitments QuickQuid sent me was £371 and 
for loan 3 it was £688. Mr J had declared other monthly credit  commitments of £250 when 
applying for loans 2 and 3. So for loan 2, QuickQuid says its checks  found Mr Js credit 
commitments were  about 50% higher than he declared and for loan 3 about 185% higher 
than he declared.
Ref: DRN49872942I can see from the new information provided how QuickQuid arrived  at the EDI figure for loan 
2. QuickQuid estimated  Mr Js monthly  disposable  income for loan 2 to be £254  and 
increasing his credit  commitments  from the £250  he declared to the £371 figure QuickQuid 
says it used would,  if deducted from his income of £1,000, leave him with £254  (this figure 
also takes into account Mr Js other  declared  expenditure, which  Ive not set out here). 
But for loan 3, QuickQuid  says it estimated  Mr Js disposable income  to be £409.  Amending 
Mr Js declared  expenditure to include the £688 figure for credit commitments  QuickQuid 
says it used would lead to total monthly expenditure of £1,013. Mr Js declared  income  for 
loan 3 was £1,250  so this would appear  to leave him with monthly disposable income of 
£237, not £409.
So QuickQuid hasnt  explained how it arrived at the EDI figure for loan 3. And although I can 
now see how it reached the EDI figure  for loan 2, QuickQuid still hasnt provided any 
information about what it actually saw from its credit  checks. So I cant  say whether the CRA 
figures it used were actually reasonable or not and in turn cant  say that the EDI figures 
reflect a proportionate check.
But as I paid in my provisional decision,  I dont think its likely proportionate checks  wouldve 
suggested that Mr J was been in a better position  than QuickQuid estimated. So its still 
reasonable to take the EDI figures  into account.
For loan 3, I think the new information  QuickQuid  has provided actually suggests this loan 
was even less likely  to be sustainably affordable than Id suggested in my provisional 
decision. It appears, on these new figures,  that the total payments due would exceed  Mr Js 
disposable income. So Im not departing from my provisional findings  for loan 3.
The affordability of loan 2 is perhaps  more debatable. The largest  payment is significantly  
higher than Mr Js monthly  disposable income. So QuickQuid expected Mr J to save  money 
to make that payment. It says that Mr J ticked a box and agreed  to a declaration stating:
By checking this box you acknowledge  you can afford to make a repayment  of [£X] on 
[date] and [£Y] on [date]. You acknowledge that you understand your final repayment is 
greater than your normal  disposable  income and you may need to save  money over the life 
of the loan in order  to make the final repayment out of disposable income. 
But Mr J ticking  a box doesnt take away QuickQuids own responsibility  to assess  whether 
or not loan 2 was going to be sustainably affordable for him. 
If QuickQuid felt that in Mr Js case hed need  to take some action to meet his loan 
repayments as they fell due, this suggests  that it understood that there  was a risk that he 
would not be able repay his loan the way it was structured unless remedial action was put in 
place. It then left this to Mr J to address. It didnt, for example, offer to structure the loan 
repayments to reflect  its expectations of Mr Js money management.  
I can accept that in some circumstances,  where  the shortfall in disposable income is small, it 
might be reasonable  to proceed with an application on the basis that the additional cost of 
the final large loan repayment could be met without difficulty by some  level of surplus  or 
saving from previous months.  And especially so where there is no history of borrowing or 
other indications  that a consumer might not be in a position to save or have surplus  income 
from earlier months. 
Ref: DRN49872943But Mr J took out loan 2 just one week after repaying loan 2 and borrowed more. This 
doesnt suggest to me that Mr J was left with a surplus each  month. So, as I explained in my 
provisional decision, I continue to think that it wasnt reasonable for QuickQuid to accept 
Mr J was in a position to save enough  money  in order to afford  the largest repayment on 
loan 2.
Because the largest repayment significantly exceeded QuickQuids estimate of Mr Js 
monthly disposable income, I dont think loan 2 was sustainably  affordable  for him. I think  
QuickQuid ought  to have realised, from the information available to it, that this was likely to 
be the case. And I dont think its likely proportionate  checks wouldve suggested Mr J was in 
a better  financial position  than QuickQuid  estimated  the significant  increase in Mr Js 
indebtedness by the end of the period of lending supports  this. Im therefore upholding Mr Js 
compliant about  loan 2.
QuickQuid raised another point in its response  to my provisional decision, although Im 
unsure why it thought it was relevant. It said I had suggested, CONC restricts lending  to a 
specific number of loans  to a consumer and after which point any subsequent lending is 
de facto unsustainable.
I did not suggest this in my provisional  decision,  after all Mr J only had three loans with 
QuickQuid and so theres  no reason why I would  have  concerns about the loans purely  
because of the number of lending decisions.
what QuickQuid  should  do to put things right
QuickQuid must:
refund  the interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 2 and 3
add to the above interest at 8% simple per year, from when they were  paid until the 
date of settlement
remove any adverse information  about  loans 2 and 3 from Mr Js credit history
HM Revenue & Customs requires QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest.  QuickQuid  must give 
Mr J a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint  in part. CashEuroNet  UK LLC must put things right by taking the 
steps set out above.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mr J to accept or 
reject my decision  before 6 April 2019.

An adjudicator considered the complaint and recommended it be upheld.  He didnt think QuickQuid  
shouldve approved any of the loans.  QuickQuid didnt  agree, so the complaint was passed to me to 
decide.
my provisional  findings
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and reasonable  in the 
circumstances of this complaint.
Weve set out our general approach to complaints about short-term  lending on our website  and Ive 
taken this into account in deciding  Mr Js case.
QuickQuid said that it could not agree that it was irresponsible in lending to Mr J because:
since 1st March  2015,  QuickQuid implemented  [an] affordability review,  which involved  collecting 
and validating  income and expense  details from customers, in line with the [Financial Conduct 
Authority] FCA Handbook. As such, we believe Mr [J]s loans issued  post 2015 were affordable.  
Please note that we have  escalated  the broader concern of loans issued post February 2015 to your 
senior leadership and are in active discussion in an effort to reach a resolution.
In response to the adjudication, QuickQuid didnt comment on our adjudicators case-specific findings  
about the proportionality of its checks or the affordability of the loans, nor did it provide any new 
information for me to consider. It said:
In response to [your]  assessment which  recommends CashEuroNet UK [puts right]  loans which  were 
funded after March 2015, we regret to inform you that we cannot agree  to [your]  recommendations. 
Please note that in CashEuroNet UKs  initial  response to FOS we provided  detailed information 
indicating why the loans  were responsibly lent to Mr [J].
It attached  to its response a document outlining its lending process  which this service has seen  on 
numerous previous occasions.
Ref: DRN49872945This Service has responded to QuickQuid on the above generic argument directly and through  earlier 
final decisions.  So I am not going  to address this point here, though I have considered it alongside 
everything else in making my decision.
I would remind QuickQuid at this point of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance in how 
complaints are to be dealt  with promptly and fairly (my emphasis) by businesses. In particular  DISP 
1.3.2A [G] which says that businesses procedures  for complaint handling should  
ensure that lessons learned as a result  of determinations  by the Ombudsman are effectively  applied 
in future complaint handling,  for example by:
(1) relaying a determination  by the Ombudsman to the individuals  in the respondent who handled 
the complaint and using it in their training and development;
(2) analysing any patterns in determinations by the Ombudsman  concerning complaints received 
by the respondent and using this in training and development  of the individuals dealing with 
complaints in the respondent; and
(3) analysing guidance  produced by the FCA , other relevant regulators and the Financial  
Ombudsman Service and communicating it to the individuals  dealing with complaints in the 
respondent.
My decision  will focus on the specifics of Mr Js complaint and what both parties  have said about this.
The FCA was the regulator  at the time Mr J borrowed  the loans in question.  Bearing in mind the rules  
and guidance set out in its Principles for Business  (PRIN) and its Consumer Credit Sourcebook 
(CONC), I would expect a lenders affordability assessment to vary with circumstance. (I am not 
quoting the specific regulations here because, as before, I would expect QuickQuid to be conversant 
with these  through previous  ombudsman decisions, particularly recent decisions, which  set these  out 
in detail.) 
In general, Id expect a lender to require  more assurance the greater the potential risk to the 
consumer of not being  able to repay the credit  in a sustainable way. So, for example, Id expect  a 
lender to seek more  assurance by carrying out more detailed checks:
- the higher  the loan amount,
- the lower the consumers income; or
- the longer  the lending relationship.
With this in mind, Ive taken into account whether QuickQuid carried out proportionate checks before  
lending to Mr J. And Ill also consider whether  Mr J lost out if I find QuickQuid did something wrong.
Before lending  to Mr J, QuickQuid asked him some  questions  about  his residential status, his 
employment status  and his monthly income  and expenditure. It recorded  that Mr J said he was 
employed and living in rented accommodation.
For loans 1 and 2, it recorded that Mr Js net monthly income was £1,000 and that his total monthly 
expenditure was £625. For loan 3, it recorded his net monthly income as £1,250 and his expenditure 
as £575.
QuickQuid also carried out credit checks on Mr J  but it hasnt shared the full results with this service. 
It has provided a figure it calls EDI  estimated disposable income  which it says it calculates  using 
information provided  by Mr J and third parties, such as credit reference agencies. It hasnt shared 
exactly how it worked  out what Mr Js EDI was but says it came to the following EDI figures:
Loan  1  £256
Loan  2  £254
Loan  3  £409
Ref: DRN49872946Without knowing how QuickQuid arrived  at the above figures, Im unable  to say whether or not they 
form part of a proportionate  check.
Nonetheless, I think  QuickQuids checks, overall, were proportionate for loan 1. The information Mr J 
provided suggested his total monthly expenditure left him with approximately  £375 a month  from his 
income to put towards  other  costs.
As Ive set out above, QuickQuid estimated  Mr Js disposable income was lower than £375  and 
again, Ive not seen information about the factors which  influenced this. Ive noted  that QuickQuids 
estimate for disposable income was £256  a month  which was lower than the final payment of £310 
due in March 2017. As this was Mr Js first loan with QuickQuid, I dont think it was unreasonable for it 
to assume Mr J could carry over income  from the first two months into the third month.  I cant see that 
it had a reason to doubt Mr J could or would  do this before it approved loan 1. Im not planning  to 
uphold Mr Js complaint about loan 1.
For loans 2 and 3, I do not think QuickQuids  checks were  proportionate. For both loans 2 and 3 Mr J 
returned only shortly after repaying the preceding loan and the amounts he asked for increased  
suggesting he was struggling to sustainably settle his debts. The largest  payments on both loans  2 
and 3 were  also substantial when compared to Mr Js monthly income.  
At this point Id usually go on to consider  what proportionate checks would likely  have shown. But I 
dont think I need to do that in Mr Js case. Ill explain why.
Loans 2 and 3 (like loan 1) had final payments higher  than QuickQuids estimate of Mr Js monthly 
disposable income.  These were a payment of £436.80 against monthly EDI of £254 for loan 2 and a 
payment of £873.60 against  monthly  EDI of £409 for loan 3. So the largest  repayments were 
substantially higher  than QuickQuids estimate of Mr Js disposable income.
While I dont  know  how QuickQuid arrived at the above EDI figures, I dont think  its likely  
proportionate checks wouldve shown QuickQuid Mr J was in a better position  than it estimated. 
I think  its more  likely  proportionate  checks wouldve  revealed further  or more detailed  information  
about Mr Js indebtedness  or, in a better scenario,  that the EDI figures were broadly correct. If 
I were  to take the better scenario, Mr J would  still have to carry  over a significant amount of income  
from months one and/or two into month three for the repayment  to be sustainable for him. 
At the time the loans  were  approved, CONC 5.2.1R (2) (b) said QuickQuid needed to consider 
whether Mr J would be able to sustainably  make his repayments as they fell due. So whether  the 
largest repayments  which required Mr J to save  were affordable to him is a key question.
I dont think it was reasonable for QuickQuid to assume Mr J was likely to be in a position to save 
from month to month. I say this because hed returned  for both loans 2 and 3 only shortly after 
repaying the preceding loans. And the amounts he was borrowing also increased with each loan: loan 
2 was more than a third of his monthly income and loan 3 was more than half of his income.  That Mr J 
needed to borrow more money, only shortly after settling a loan, doesnt suggest he was in a position 
to save  money from month  to month. Ive also noted that Mr J was charged late fees on loans 1 and 
2, which again suggests  he didnt always have money  available when  required to make a payment 
and so wasnt  saving.
In summary, I think QuickQuid  ought to have realised  that Mr J would  be unlikely to be able to 
sustainably make  the largest payment on loans 2 and 3 when those payments  fell due.
Im therefore  planning to uphold his complaint about them.
what QuickQuid should  do to put things right
I plan to say QuickQuid should:
Ref: DRN49872947refund the interest and charges Mr J paid on loans 2 and 3
add to the above  interest at 8% simple  per year, from when they were paid until the date of 
settlement
remove any adverse  information about loans 2 and 3 from Mr Js credit history
HM Revenue & Customs requires  QuickQuid to take off tax from this interest. QuickQuid must give 
Mr J a certificate showing  how much tax its taken  off if he asks for one.
