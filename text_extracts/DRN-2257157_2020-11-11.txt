The complaint
Miss M complains that Loans 2 Go Limited (L2G) lent to her in 2019 when she was unable to 
afford the loan
What happened
The details of this complaint are well known to both parties, so I wont repeat them again 
here. The facts are not in dispute, so Ill focus on giving the reasons for my decision.
What Ive decided  and why
Ive considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide whats fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Having done so, I agree with the conclusions reached by the adjudicator for these reasons:
L2G reviewed Miss Ms complaint and agreed that it shouldnt have lent to her and it 
offered to put things right.
L2Gs offer wasnt fully in line with this services recommendation but it has agreed 
with the adjudicator to bring its offer in line with this service.
In these circumstances, I agree that Miss M should repay the capital amount 
borrowed as shes had access to the money, and I think its fair for her to repay this.
Putting things right
L2G needs to put things right for Miss M by:
Remove all interest and charges added to the loan so that Miss M only repays the 
capital amount of Â£500.
Remove all adverse information on Miss Ms credit file as a result of this loan
As theres a balance outstanding L2G should agree a repayment arrangement with 
Miss M to repay the balance. 
My final decision
My final decision is that this complaint should be upheld, and Loans 2 Go should put things 
right as set out above. 
Under the rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Im required to ask Miss M to accept 
or reject my decision before 9 December 2020.
