K821x#15complaint
Mrs Bs unhappy with Admiral Insurance Company Limiteds valuation of her vehicle in a 
claim on her motor  insurance policy. 
background
Mrs Bs vehicle  was written off in an accident in May 2018.  She thinks Admirals £10,140 
valuation of it is too low. She says she paid £12,250 for it in September 2017 and a 
replacement vehicle would cost her about £16,000. She wants  Admiral to increase its 
valuation.
Admiral said in its final response that the policy says it will offer the market  value of the 
vehicle. Thats the price Mrs B could  reasonably  expect to pay on the open market on the 
day of the loss for a similar replacement  vehicle. It obtained a valuation from a trade  guide  of 
£8,325 and an independent  engineer  had suggested £10,140. It had used the higher of 
these two valuations.  
our investigators view
Our investigator felt this complaint  should  be upheld. She said:
Mrs B has provided evidence of a similar vehicle being  for sale for £16,000  and she 
bought the original  vehicle for £12,250. But advertised prices tend to be higher than 
selling process.
The independent engineer adjusted the valuation by taking off £345 for the vehicles 
average condition.  But this hasnt been  justified and theres nothing  to show its 
average condition  being over ten years old wouldve had a detrimental effect on its 
market value. 
The guides and tools shes consulted indicate  the vehicles value was between  
£9,990 and £12,477. Thats an average  of £11,233. Another  guide gave a real time 
valuation of £11,442 but she hasnt  relied  on that as its out of date.
She isnt satisfied Admirals offer is fair. So it should pay the difference between 
£10,140 and £11,233 plus some interest.
Admiral didnt agree. It said the £12,477  valuation  the investigator  had obtained  is clearly  out 
of line with guide prices and the independent engineers valuation after an inspection.  It 
should be discarded. But it was happy to increase the valuation  by the £345 previously 
deducted for the condition of the vehicle.
The investigator responded that we only normally discard valuations when there are three 
available. Here there are only two. The value shed discarded of £11,442  isnt conclusive but 
is in line with the suggested settlement and is indicative  of where the valuation lies.
Admiral still didnt agree and has asked for an ombudsman review. It said the £12,477 
valuation is out of line and should be discarded. Its much more  than the engineers valuation 
or that obtained  by the investigator of £9,990. But it was still prepared to increase its 
valuation by £345 to £10,485.
Ref: DRN89151952my provisional decision
I issued a provisional decision in this complaint on 11 November 2019.  In summary, subject 
to any further evidence and submissions from the parties, I was minded to uphold the 
complaint. 
Taking everything into account  I felt on balance that the likely  range for the valuation of this 
particular vehicle was between £10,319  and £10,543. And as Admirals revised offer of 
£10,485 was squarely  within this range I thought  I must consider it to be fair and reasonable. 
So, I was minded to require  Admiral  to pay Mrs B an additional £345 plus some  interest.
Mrs B says she is disappointed with this outcome.  But there is no point  in disagreeing.
my findings
Ive considered all the available  evidence  and arguments to decide  whats  fair and 
reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
Mrs Bs policy says the most Admiral will pay is the market value of her vehicle which  is the 
cost of replacing it at the time of loss. 
That sum isnt necessarily the same amount that she bought the vehicle for or the cost to her 
of actually replacing it. 
We dont provide a precise valuation of a vehicle. We consider if the offer being  made  is 
reasonable. We normally base this on the various  trade guides  and we will also look at any 
other evidence produced  including adverts. But I place most weight on the values  in the 
main trade guides as theyre based  on likely  selling  prices  rather than advertised prices,  
which allow  a margin for negotiation.
Trade guide prices  are by their very nature averages  based on national  figures. And 
variations in actual  figures may occur from place to place. 
The difficulty  in this case is that the main  trade  guides dont all give a value for this vehicle 
which was manufactured  in 2003  and those that do are of limited help is assessing  a fair 
valuation as they are for quite a wide range of values.  
The single trade guide price obtained  by Admiral was £8,325  and one obtained by our 
investigator was £9,990.  Additionally Admiral  obtained a report from an engineer and its 
recently agreed to accept  the engineers gross valuation without any deduction  of £10,485.
The investigator also obtained a valuation of £12,477 from another valuation  tool. Admiral 
would like this to be discarded as it says its much  higher than the other valuations but Im 
not convinced  to do so would necessarily  be fair. Not only is this a valuation  from a reputable 
source but I think it may also reflect what Mrs B has told us that this particular make and 
model of vehicle is highly sought after and desirable to buyers. And she says this has quite 
an effect on its value  and prices. 
Our investigator felt that £11,233  was a fair valuation  as it represents the average of the two 
valuation figures  she obtained of £12,477  and £9,990. But I dont  agree  that it would be fair 
to discard the valuations  Admiral obtained  particularly that from the independent  engineer 
who actually inspected the vehicle.
Ref: DRN89151953Taking everything into account  I think the only fair and reasonable way to assess a fair 
valuation for this particular vehicle is to take the average of the various valuations that are 
available.
The average of the four valuations from the various  trade guides and tools  and the 
independent engineer yields an average  value of £10,319.25.
And if the indicative valuation of £11,442 that the investigator obtained but didnt take into 
account is also included  then the average rises to £10,543.80.
I think that these two figures provide  a fair and reasonable indication of the likely range for 
the valuation of this particular vehicle.  That is between  £10,319  and £10,543. And as 
Admirals revised offer of £10,485 is squarely  within this range I think  I must consider  it to be 
fair and reasonable.
I therefore think Admiral should  pay the additional  £345 to Mrs B plus some  interest.
my final decision
I uphold this complaint.  To put things  right Admiral Insurance Company Limited should pay 
Mrs B an additional £345  plus simple  interest on this sum at the rate of 8% a year from the 
date of loss to the date of payment.
Under the rules  of the Financial Ombudsman Service,  Im required to ask Mrs B to accept or 
reject my decision  before 24 January 2020.
